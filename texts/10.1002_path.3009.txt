Abstract Intestinal mucositis is a serious complication of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy; it frequently compromises treatment and dramatically reduces the quality of life of patients. Different approaches to limit the damage to the intestine during anti-cancer therapy have been largely ineffective due to insufficient knowledge of the mechanism of mucositis development. This study aimed to define the role of TLR-2 and TLR-9 in the modulation of small intestinal damage in a model of doxorubicin-induced mucositis. Doxorubicin-induced intestinal damage was verified by a histological score (HS), analysis of leukocyte influx into the lamina propria, and determination of the number of apoptotic cells. Additionally, the activation status of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) was assessed. Wild-type (WT) mice injected with doxorubicin demonstrated severe intestinal damage (HS 8.0 ± 0.81), reduction of villus length to 43.9% ± 13.7% of original length, and increased influx of leukocytes as compared to vehicle-injected mice (HS 1.33 ± 1.15). The protective effect of TLR-2 or TLR-9 deficiency was associated with a significant decrease of the HS as compared to WT mice. In the ileum, a minor reduction of villus length and a decreased number of infiltrating leukocytes and TUNEL-positive cells was observed. We demonstrate that the TLR-9 antagonist ODN2088 reduces doxorubicin-induced intestinal damage. Furthermore, we show that GSK-3β activity is inhibited in the absence of TLR-2. The protective capacity of GSK-3β suppression was observed in WT mice by inhibiting it with the specific inhibitor SB216763. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the TLR-2/GSK-3β and TLR-9 signalling pathways play a central role in the development of intestinal mucositis and we suggest a new therapeutic strategy for limiting doxorubicin-induced intestinal inflammation.

Introduction Mucosal barrier injury (MBI, mucositis) of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) remains a serious side effect of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Oral mucositis is painful and the most frequent complication [1]. Gut MBI, however, is a real danger because it goes unrecognized, yet predisposes patients to serious clinical complications, including increased risk of infections and bleeding leading to prolonged hospitalization. It also dictates dose reduction in the subsequent chemotherapy cycle, which slows or hinders cure of the disease [2,3]. The mechanism of mucositis development is still not fully understood. However, a five-step model formulated by Sonis [4,5] describes an initiation phase of cell injury and NF-κB activation, followed by induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which then cause tissue inflammation [6,7] and further cell apoptosis. Massive apoptosis disrupts the epithelial barrier, allowing bacterial translocation from the lumen to the lamina propria, which causes ulceration. Indeed, alterations in intestinal permeability and damage of epithelial continuity have been reported in patients [8,9]. In the final stage, epithelium is renewed and mucositis is resolved. Intestinal bacteria are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), of which Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best characterized. TLRs are expressed on intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes [10], Paneth cells [11], goblet cells [12], and endocrine cells [13]) and professional immune cells of lamina propria [14]. The importance of TLR signalling in intestinal homeostasis and in diseases is now well Copyright © 2011 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Recognition of microbes via their microbeassociated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and consequent distinction between commensal bacteria and other microbes have been shown to maintain intestinal homeostasis [15]. Detection of pathogens triggers immune responses involving secretion of antimicrobial peptides [16] and cytokines [17]. Despite the beneficial role of PRRs, deregulation of TLR signalling is also associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and gastrointestinal cancer [18]. Moreover, TLRs were recently recognized as upstream receptors of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) [19]. GSK-3 regulates multiple transcription factors important in inflammation and cytokine production [20], as well as cell cycle progression and apoptosis [21], and contributes to the pathogenesis of several diseases, including chronic colitis [22]. It has been shown that TLRs could modulate cell death in several model systems [23–25] and that apoptosis precedes intestinal hypoplasia in patients [26]; we therefore hypothesize that TLRs might play a role in the initiation phase of MBI development, not only in the later stages as proposed by Sonis [4]. To address this question, we employed a doxorubicininduced murine mucositis model to investigate whether TLRs are required for the development of mucositis. We report the novel finding that absence of TLR-2 or TLR-9 results in protection of the small intestine against doxorubicin, most likely by reduction of epithelial cell apoptosis. We also demonstrate that the severity of doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis can be reduced by using a TLR-9 antagonist. In addition, we show that the pro-survival effect of TLR-2 deficiency in this model is correlated with inhibition of GSK-3β activity. Materials and methods Mice For the kinetics experiments, female C57BL/6 mice (7–10 weeks old) were purchased from Janvier (Bio Services BV, The Netherlands). We used TLR-2−/− and TLR-9−/− single knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were used as controls. WT and TLR-2−/− mice were bred in the FSVM SPF facility. TLR-9−/− and WT mice were bred at the animal facility of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. All experimental procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee of Ghent University–VIB. Doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldricht, Bornem, Belgium) was freshly dissolved in sterile LPS-free 0.9% NaCl (Braun-NVSA, Diegem, Belgium). Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 mg/kg of doxorubicin in 0.2 ml of 0.9% NaCl. Equal volumes of 0.9% NaCl were injected as controls. After mice were euthanized, jejunum and ileum were collected for immunohistochemical evaluation. Mid-jejunum was collected for protein isolation. Histological evaluation of mucositis Samples of proximal and distal ileum were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with H&E. Sections were viewed with a light microscope (Axioskop 2, Zeiss). At least 15 random villi per mouse were blind-scored by two independent investigators. For evaluation, we used a modified [27] histological scoring system (HS, ranges from 1 to 12 points; Supporting information, Supplementary Table 1). Villus height and thickness were measured using ImageJ software on images captured with a microscope camera at 20× magnification. Briefly, the height of the intact villus was measured from the base of the villus (opening of the crypt) to the top. Thickness was measured at the base of the villus. At least 15 villi were analysed. The raw measurements in pixels were converted to μm taking into account microscope magnification. Immunohistochemistry A standard protocol was used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The primary antibodies were rat anti-mouse F4/80 antigen (1 : 100; MCA497GA, Abd Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany), CD45 (1 : 250; BD Benelux NV, Temse, Belgium), and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO, Heverlee, Belgium). TUNEL assay was performed with the ApopTag ® Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (S7100; Millipore, Billerica, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. Images were taken under a bright field microscope. In the case of CD45 staining, positive cells were counted using ImageJ software and the count was expressed as the percentage of positively stained cells in the viewing field. At least five random fields were examined for each mouse. For TUNEL staining, positively stained cells were counted within crypts and counts were expressed as the average number of apoptotic cells per crypt. Inhibition of TLR-9 in vivo WT mice were divided into three groups and injected as follows: (1) 50 μg of TLR-9 antagonist ODN2088 (Invivogen, Toulouse, France) together with doxorubicin (10 mg/kg), and 6 h later with another dose of 50 μg of ODN; (2) doxorubicin alone and 6 h later an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl; (3) 0.9% NaCl [28]. Samples were harvested 72 h later and processed as described above. Inhibition of GSK-3β in vivo GSK-3 activity was blocked with SB216763 (BioConnect BV, Huissen, The Netherlands), a known inhibitor of GSK-3α and -β [29].

The control group received 0.9% NaCl with an equivalent volume of DMSO, which was used to dilute SB216763. Samples were harvested 24 and 72 h later and processed as described above. Immunoblot analysis Mid-jejunum segments of about 5 mm were homogenized in 500 μl of caspase lysis buffer [31]. Fifty micrograms of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on PVDF membranes. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 ◦C with Phospho(Ser9)-GSK-3β (1 : 2000; Cell Signaling, Leiden, The Netherlands), washed, and incubated with ECL™ anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked whole antibody (1 : 3000; GE Healthcare, Hoevelaken, The Nederlands). Actin staining was used as a loading control. ImageJ software was used to quantify band intensity. Relative density was expressed as the ratio of GSK-3β to actin. Statistical analysis All data are given as mean ± SEM. The Mann– Whitney test or one-way ANOVA with the Kruskal– Wallis post-test was used to evaluate the differences between the groups (GraphPad Prism-5 software). 0h 3h 6h 24h 48h 72h Villus thickness Villus length Dox 72h Dox 48h Dox 24h Vehicle ** * ** * # 100 100 150 200 25075 7550 5025 250 (μm) 18 17 16 15 0 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 % of C D 45 + c el ls p er fi el d n=8 n=9 n=6 n=6 n=6 n=6 n=8 n=8 Veh Dox 6h Veh Dox 24h Veh Dox 48h Veh Dox 72h veh dox 3.2 2.8 2.4 2.0 1.6 1.2 0.8 0.4 0.0 T U N E L+ c el ls p er c ry pt veh 6h 24h 48h 72h n=8 n=9 n=4 n=4 n=5 A B C D Figure 1.

Results Doxorubicin induces time-dependent damage of the small intestine in wild-type mice Intestinal morphology was examined to evaluate the influence of doxorubicin on mucositis development. Tissue sections revealed time-dependent changes in ileum structure in response to treatment. Intestinal morphology was normal 3 h post-injection, but the influx of immune cells in the lamina propria was elevated 6 h later. Within 48 h of injection, villus blunting and an amorphic crypt shape were noticeable. Villus and crypt degeneration was most pronounced 72 h after doxorubicin injection relative to other time points (Figure 1A). Quantitative analysis showed time-dependent gradual shortening of villi, leading to their atrophy (Figure 1B). Having noticed cell infiltration in H&E-stained sections, we examined whether doxorubicin treatment influences immune cell migration from blood vessels to the lamina propria of the intestine. We counted CD45+ leukocytes and F4/80+ macrophages in the ileum. The first large influx of CD45+ leukocytes occurred 6 h after doxorubicin administration and the second was 72 h post-injection (Figure 1C). The number of mature macrophages remained unchanged during the treatment, yet on average it was 1.7 times higher than in the control group (data not shown).

The number of apoptotic cells reached 2.08 ± 0.65 cells per crypt 24 h after doxorubicin treatment, decreased to 0.95 ± 0.24 48 h later, and diminished further to 0.64 ± 0.1 cells 72 h after doxorubicin injection (Figure 1D). Most TUNEL-positive cells were located between cell positions 3 and 6 of the intestinal crypt (Figure 1D). Absence of TLR-2 or TLR-9 signalling protects from doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis We previously showed that TLR-2 and TLR-9 knockout mice have reduced signs of doxorubicin-induced acute peritonitis [32], but we did not investigate intestinal damage in these mice. To investigate the role of TLR-2 and TLR-9 in doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis, we determined the histological scores (HS) [27] of ileal tissue 72 h post-injection. Doxorubicin induced severe intestinal damage in WT mice (HS 8.0 ± 0.81 compared with 1.33 ± 1.15 in vehicle-injected mice). The ileum of TLR-2−/− mice (HS 4.0 ± 1.82) was significantly less affected than in WT mice, indicating protection against doxorubicin treatment (Figures 2A and 2B). The marked shrinkage and thickening of villi and stroma retraction from enterocytes observed in WT mice were not present in TLR-2-deficient mice (Figures 2A and 2C). CD45+ leukocytes in the lamina propria were significantly fewer in TLR2−/− mice than in WT mice (Figure 2D). Degeneration of the intestine after doxorubicin treatment was also less severe in TLR-9−/− mice (HS 4.25 ± 1.25 compared with 7.75 ± 1.70 in WT mice) (Figures 3A and 3B).

The percentage of CD45+ leukocytes was smaller in TLR-9−/− mice (7.23% ± 1.93%) than in WT mice (10.89% ± 1.96% in WT) (Figure 3D). Lack of TLR-2 or TLR-9 signalling increases the survival of enterocytes after doxorubicin treatment Having demonstrated that most apoptotic events occur within 24 h after doxorubicin treatment (Figure 1D), we investigated whether the absence of TLR-2 or TLR-9 signalling can influence the survival of cells and thus contribute to the decreased histological signs of intestinal mucositis. TUNEL assay of ileum tissue sections revealed significantly fewer apoptotic cells in crypts of TLR-2(1.26 ± 0.95) and TLR-9-deficient mice (0.68 ± 0.45) compared with WT mice (2.26 ± 0.88) (Figures 4A and 4B). TLR-9 antagonist mitigates the severity of doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis Because deficiency of TLR-2 or TLR-9 reduced the signs of doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis, we hypothesized that treatment of WT animals with TLR antagonists could protect them against this side effect of doxorubicin. Several TLR antagonists are commercially available, but we are unaware of any TLR2 antagonists. We therefore tested our hypothesis by blocking TLR-9 signalling using ODN2088 [33]. WT animals were injected with doxorubicin alone or with doxorubicin combined with ODN2088. Coadministration of ODN2088 provided significant protection of intestinal villi against doxorubicin. Neither villus blunting nor atrophy was observed (Figure 5A). By contrast, mice treated only with doxorubicin showed all the signs of severe intestinal damage. HS was decreased, by an average of 43% after ODN treatment (Figure 5B). Villus shape and thickness in the ileum remained unchanged (Figure 5C) and the percentage of CD45+ leukocytes dropped to control level in ODN-treated animals but was significantly elevated in mice treated only with doxorubicin (Figure 5D). Absence of TLR-2 decreases the severity of doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis by increasing inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β GSK-3β is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional kinase that influences a variety of cellular processes [34].

We observed that doxorubicin injection in WT mice induced time-dependant phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9, which inhibits its activity (Figure 6A). Decreased GSK-3β activity coincided with the decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive cells at later time points (48 and 72 h, Figure 1D). This prompted us to analyse whether the phosphorylation status of GSK-3β might contribute to the protection of TLR-2and TLR-9-deficient mice against intestinal mucositis. Inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β was increased at 24 h after injection in TLR-2−/− mice (Figure 6B), which might explain the decreased number of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, we observed only basal levels of inhibitory phosphorylation in TLR-9-deficient mice (data not shown), indicating that probably different mechanisms contribute to reducing the number of apoptotic cells and to protection of the intestinal architecture. Inhibition of GSK-3β protects WT mice from doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis The observation that GSK-3β inhibition was accompanied by a pro-survival effect in the absence of TLR-2 led us to investigate whether we could decrease apoptosis and protect the intestine against doxorubicin by using the GSK-3β inhibitor SB216763 in WT mice. Indeed, combining SB216763 with doxorubicin treatment protected the small intestine from the cytotoxicity (Figure 7A). The HS of mice pretreated with the inhibitor before doxorubicin injection was on average 1.6 times lower than the HS of mice treated with doxorubicin only (Figure 7B). Moreover, this combined therapy resulted in a 1.5-fold decrease in the number of apoptotic cells observed 24 h after doxorubicin administration (Figure 7C). This decrease in apoptosis was accompanied by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β after 24 h (Figure 7D). Copyright © 2011 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Discussion Mucositis is a serious complication in patients undergoing anti-cancer treatment and frequently limits the use of radiation and chemotherapy [2]. Therefore, there is a compelling need for a better understanding of the endogenous mechanisms of mucositis development. In the present study, we used a mouse model of doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis to show for the first time that TLR-2 or TLR-9 deficiency significantly ameliorates the signs of ileitis caused by drug administration. A harmful role of TLRs has been shown in other models of intestinal damage. For example, it has been shown in the model of Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a major GIT complication after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, that TLR9−/− mice had reduced intestinal damage and increased survival [35,36]. Also, it has been proposed that stimulation of TLR-3 by double-stranded DNA contributes to the severity of intestinal damage [37]. However, TLR signalling under certain conditions might be protective. It has been shown that mice deficient in TLR-2 or TLR-9 are more susceptible to DSSinduced colitis [38,39]. Additionally, flagellin administration (TLR-5 stimulation) protected the gut from ionizing radiation [40–42]. The discrepancies between these studies might be explained by the different models used and the organs studied (DSS-induced colitis versus doxorubicin-induced ileitis) and by the diversity of TLR expression along the GIT [14,43]. On the other hand, these contradictory studies strongly suggest that activation of TLRs could be a double-edged sword that can be either beneficial or detrimental to intestinal integrity. A possible explanation for the amelioration of MBI severity in our model is that absence of TLR-2 or TLR9 decreases doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in intestinal crypts (Figures 5A and 5B). It has also been observed that TLR stimulation can lead to caspase-dependent apoptosis [44,45] and several recent studies demonstrated a crucial role for TLRs in apoptosis in a variety of cells. For example, TLR-2 is required for opioidinduced neuronal apoptosis [25], and TLR-9 deficiency results in resistance to M. tuberculosis-induced apoptosis in vivo [23] and prevents morphine-induced microglia apoptosis [24]. Therefore, in contrast to the model proposed by Sonis [4,5], our findings suggest a role for TLRs in protecting epithelial cells from the apoptosis induced by cytotoxic therapy before bacterial translocation and intestinal ulceration occur. GSK-3 is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase known as an important molecular switch between apoptosis and cell survival [21]. This constitutively active kinase is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt signalling, which is also downstream of the TLR pathway [46–48]. Here, we investigated the status of inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β in WT and TLR-2 or TLR-9 knockout mice in doxorubicininduced intestinal mucositis. Inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β in WT mice increased 48 and 72 h after doxorubicin injection (Figures 6A and 6B). This rather late increase in inhibitory phosphorylation probably reflects pro-survival signalling, as indicated by the reduction of apoptosis at these late time points (Figure 1D). GSK-3β inhibitory phosphorylation was up-regulated in TLR-2-deficient mice, which could explain the low levels of apoptosis in the intestinal crypts. In our model of mucositis, inhibition of GSK3β reduced the rate of apoptosis and the severity of intestinal damage (Figures 6A and 6B), which is in agreement with a previous observation that GSK-3 Copyright © 2011 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

However, modulation of the cell death or survival decision by GSK-3β is complex, and the decision to switch on apoptotic or survival mechanisms could be different in other model systems [21]. Considering that TLRs are components of the first line of immune responses, there is considerable interest in the therapeutic targeting of these receptors by using either TLR agonists or antagonists, depending on the clinical application [49]. We propose that a TLR-9 antagonistic ODN can have a therapeutic effect on doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis. Our data are in line with the use of ODNs in the experimental treatment of IBD [50,51] and GvHD [36]. It has been shown that oral or intraperitoneal administration of inhibitory adenoviral ODN decreases inflammation in DSS-induced colitis and in a model of severe combined immunodeficiency colitis [50,51]. Together, these data point to a possible therapeutic strategy to reduce the severity of intestinal mucositis by using TLR-9 antagonists. However, additional studies will have to be performed to address the safety of this antagonist and to evaluate its effect on the efficacy of anti-cancer treatment.
