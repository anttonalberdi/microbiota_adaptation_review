Epidemiological investigations also found a tight correlation between periodontitis (PD) and osteoporosis. This study aimed to further explore the effect of periodontal pathogens on bone volume fraction like bone tissue and mass, and explain the relationship between PD and osteoporosis. Sprague Dawley rats (female, 16 weeks old) were divided into the wild-type (WT) control group (n=9) and PD group (n=9). After eight weeks, periodontal tissues and ligatures, the fourth lumbar vertebra, the femur, the tibia, and blood were extracted and analyzed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), respectively. We found that the bone mass of the lumbar vertebra, femur, and tibia was decreased in the PD group. The number of osteoclasts was higher in bone tissue in the PD group than in the WT group (P<0.05). The levels of inflammatory mediators and type I collagen C-terminal peptide (CTX-1) were higher in the PD group than in the WT group (P<0.05), although no significant difference in bone glutamic acid protein (BGP) levels was observed (P>0.05). In addition, we detected several periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, in blood samples from rats in the PD group. These findings suggest that periodontal pathogens can enter the blood circulation from periodontal tissue, promote a systemic inflammation response, and subsequently reduce systemic bone density.

Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic destructive disease of periodontal support tissue and it leads to the inflammation of gums, absorption of alveolar bone, loosening and shedding of the teeth. According to an epidemiological survey among people aged 35–44 years in 2005 in China, the national periodontal health rate was only 14.2%, the detection rate of bleeding on probing (BOP) (+) was 77.3%, and the detection rate of deep periodontal pocket was 40.9%. However, in 2015, the BOP (+) detection rate was increased to 87.4%[1], indicating that PD has become more common. It is well known that PD is primarily caused by periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), and Treponema denticola (Td)[2]. These pathogens can release antigenic factors, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fimbriae, activate antigen-presenting cells, promote cytokine production and secretion, and induce irreversible damage to periodontal tissues[3]. Many studies have shown an association of PD with systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)[4]. Osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease, characterized by a decrease in bone mass and progressive deterioration of bone microstructure that can lead to a gradual increase in bone fragility, and even bone fracture. As the population ages, the incidence of osteoporosis increases and this condition ranks 754 Current Medical Science 40(4):2020 third among chronic diseases[5]. Epidemiological studies have shown that the average incidence rate of osteoporosis in China was 13%, with 8.5% in males and 15.7% in females[6, 7]. PD and osteoporosis share some risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, age, genetics, and systemic inflammation. Both diseases can lead to the loss of bone tissue. Furthermore, studies have shown a strong correlation between PD and osteoporosis[8, 9]. A cross-sectional study of 400 women in Jordan suggested that whole-body bone density was significantly associated with severe alveolar ridge height loss[10]. Given the involvement of PD in many systemic diseases, it seems that PD may participate in the progression of osteoporosis. However, strong evidence for this hypothesis is still lacking. In this study, we demonstrated that PD decreased bone mass by promoting a systemic inflammatory response. Our findings provide new insight into the effect of PD on osteoporosis. 1 MATERIALS AND METHODS 1.1 Animals This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Review Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (China). Sixteen-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats (Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Company, China) were randomly divided into the wildtype (WT) control group (n=9) and PD group (n=9). All the rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate in a dose of 0.4 mL/100 g. After anesthesia, rats in the PD group were fixed on the operating table. The upper and lower jaws were fixed with rubber bands. First, the upper jaw teeth were exposed, and the first and second molars were subjected to periodontal ligation using a 3-0 silk thread. The thread was inserted as deep as possible into the bottom of the groove, and reinforced with a 0.2 mm orthodontic ligation wire. After the maxillary teeth were ligated, the rats were fixed on the operating table in the prone position, the mandibular molars were exposed, and the first and second molars of the mandible were ligated in the same manner. The ligation silk was replaced after two, four, and six weeks. Eight weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and the fourth vertebra, the femur, the tibia, periodontal tissues, and blood were harvested for further analysis. 1.2 Bacterial Detection in Periodontal Ligation Silk and Blood Total DNA from periodontal ligation silk and blood was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (Tiangen, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene was carried out with specific bacterial primers. The 16S rDNA primer sequences and the annealing temperature are listed in table 1. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described previously[11]. The PCR products were purified by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. 1.3 Enzyme-linked Immunoassay Measurements of Inflammatory Factors and Bone Markers Blood was centrifuged at 3500 r/min for 20 min, after which the serum was collected and stored at −80°C. The serum was equilibrated at room temperature. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), bone glutamic acid protein (BGP), and type I collagen C-terminal peptide (CTX-1) were analyzed with an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit (NeoBioscience, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of each protein was calculated by measuring the absorbance (A450) and comparing it with a standard curve. 1.4 Micro-computed Tomography for Bone Analysis After the rats were sacrificed, fresh specimens from the jaw, femur, tibia, and fourth lumbar vertebra were isolated and scanned by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT scanning was performed by the same person using the same machine (Skyscan 1276) under the same conditions (filter Cu+Al, 120 μA, scanning thickness 9 μm). After scanning, the microCT results were analyzed with the indicated software. 1.5 Bone Histopathology After the rats were sacrificed, the upper and lower jaws, fourth lumbar vertebra, femur, and tibia were Table 1 PCR primer sequence Bacteria Upstream primer (f) Downstream primer (r) Product size(bp) Annealing temperature (°C) Pg AGGCAGCTTGCCATACTGCG ACTGTTAGCAACTACCGATGT 404 62 Aa AAACCCATCTCTGAGTTCTTCTTC ATGCCAACTTGACGTTAAAT 557 56 Fn AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG GTCATCGTGCACACAGAATTGCTG 360 56 Pi TTTGTTGGGGAGTAAAGCGGG TCAACATCTCTGTATCCTGCGT 575 56 Tf GCGTATGTAACCTGCCCGCA TGCTTCAGTGTCAGTTATACCT 641 56 Cr TTTCGGAGCGTAAACTCCTTTTC TTTCTGCAAGCAGACACTCTT 598 56 Sm GGCACCACAACATTGGGAAGCTCAGTT GGAATGGCCGCTAAGTCAACAGGAT 433 51 Td TAATACCGAATGTGCTCATTTACAT TCAAAGAAGCATTCCCTCTTCTTCTTA 311 51 Pn ATGAAACAAAGGTTTTCCGGTAAG CCCACGTCTATGTGGGCTGCGA 804 56 Pg: Porphyromonas gingivalis; Aa: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; Fn: Fusobacterium nucleatum; Pi: Prevotella intermedia; Tf: Tannerella forsythia; Cr: Campylobacter rectus; Sm: Streptococcus mutans; Td: Treponema denticola; Pn: Prevotella nigrescens 755Current Medical Science 40(4):2020 isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for three days. Next, the samples were decalcified in 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for two months, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 μm thick sections for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. 1.6 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis and mapping of the data were performed using SPSS 20.0 and GraphPad Prism 7.0 software. An unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare the two groups. Results are presented as mean±standard deviation. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 2 RESULTS 2.1 PD Model Establishment To establish the PD model, we performed periodontal ligation using 3-0 silk for eight weeks. The jaw specimens were separated carefully and scanned by micro-CT to analyze the alveolar bone absorption. The jaw bone sections were stained with H&E for morphological analysis and with TRAP for osteoclast observation. Micro-CT analysis showed that the resorption of alveolar bone was significantly faster in PD rats than in WT rats (fig. 1A). The staining results revealed that the apical damage in PD rats was more severe than in WT rats (fig. 1B), and that the number of osteoclasts was significantly greater in PD rats (fig. 1C). These data indicate that the PD model was successfully established. 2.2 Changes of Bone Mass in PD Rats Specimens from the fourth lumbar vertebra, femur, and tibia were scanned by micro-CT. The bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), trabecular bone (Tb.N), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) values were calculated. In the fourth lumbar vertebra, BV/TV was significantly lower and Tb.Sp was significantly higher in PD rats (P<0.05); no significant difference in Tb.Th or Tb.N was observed between the groups (fig. 2A).

The fourth vertebra (A), femur (B), and tibia (C) in the WT and PD groups were analyzed by micro-CT, with quantification analysis shown on the right. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (D) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining (E) of the femur and tibia are also shown. Lower panel shows the magnification of the images shown by red rectangles. Red arrows in fig. 2E indicate osteoclasts. 757Current Medical Science 40(4):2020 and tibia, we observed enlarged bone marrow cavities and thinner cortical bone in PD rats (fig. 2D). The number of osteoclasts within the femur and tibia was significantly higher in PD rats than in WT rats (fig. 2E). Collectively, these results suggest that PD has a harmful effect on bone mass. 2.3 Food Intake and Body Weight Considering the fact that other factors may induce differences in total bone mass, we monitored the food intake and body weight of rats in both groups. We found that no significant difference in food intake or body weight was observed (fig. 3), suggesting that the decrease in bone mass was not caused by food intake and body weight. 2.4 Changes in Inflammatory Factors and Bone Markers in the Serum The activation of TNF-α and IL-6 can reduce total bone mass[12]. Bone markers in serum, such as BGP and CTX-1, can effectively reflect changes in bone mass[13]. ELISA showed that serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels were higher in PD rats, especially after eight weeks (fig. 4A and 4B). In addition, serum CTX-1 levels were significantly higher in PD rats throughout the experiment, while BGP levels were not significantly different (fig. 4C and 4D). 2.5 Periodontal Pathogens in Blood Periodontal pathogenic bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause bacteremia, which activates the production of systemic cytokines and affects other parts of the body. To analyze the periodontal pathogens in the blood circulation, we analyzed the DNA of several periodontal pathogens from periodontal ligatures and blood samples. Pg, Aa, and Fn were found in the samples from the periodontal ligatures, blood and subgingival plaque, suggesting that these periodontal pathogens may be the reason behind the elevated inflammatory response (fig. 5). 3 DISCUSSION The prevalence of osteoporosis and periodontal disease is increasing globally[4]. In 2015, an epidemiological survey in Taiwan showed that after controlling for age, gender, income, and geographic region, there was a significant association between PD and osteoporosis in women[14]. Kobayashi et al found that compared with rats with normal bone density, rats with osteoporosis and osteopenia showed more loss of alveolar bone height and bone mass[15]. A study that evaluated osteoporosis of the jaw by two-photon absorption measurements found that osteopenia in patients with osteoporosis was directly related to the reduction of mandibular bone density[16]. The alveolar bone height in menopausal women with osteoporosis and PD decreased faster than in women without osteoporosis, and the rate of alveolar bone loss was significantly lower after taking bisphosphonates. Estrogen deficiency was associated with osteoporosis in women, and was also associated with an increased frequency of alveolar height reduction in an entire 450 440 430 420 410 400 300 200 100 0 450 500 400 400 300 200 100 0 0 W ei gh t ( g) Fo od (g ) 2 4 Time (week) Time (week) 8 2 4 8 WT PD WT PD 150 100 50 0 TN Fα (p g/ ng ) Time (week) 2 ns 4 8 WT PD * * 1500 1000 500 0 IL -6 (p g/ ng ) Time (week) 2 ns 4 8 * * 50 40 30 20 10 0 B G P (p g/ ng ) Time (week) 2 ns ns ns 4 8 1500 1000 500 0 C TX -1 (p g/ ng ) Time (week) 2 4 8 * * * WT PDA B C D WT PD WT PD Fig. 4 The serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, BGP, and CXT-1 in WT and PD rats ELISA was used to determine the concentration of TNF-α (A), IL-6 (B), BGP (C), and CXT-1 (D) in serum from WT and PD rats at the indicated time points. *P<0.05 Fig. 3 The weight and food intake of rats 758 Current Medical Science 40(4):2020 study population[15]. Researchers found that rats with osteoporosis caused by reduced glucocorticoid levels had a greater risk of alveolar bone height loss than control rats[17]. These findings indicate that osteoporosis, osteopenia, and estrogen deficiency are risk factors for alveolar bone density loss in postmenopausal women. However, whether the development of PD can accelerate osteoporosis is still unknown. Korean researchers conducted an epidemiological survey on 13 464 participants (8884 males and 4580 females) in 2017, and indicated that after controlling for all variables, the risk factors for osteoporosis were age, Charlson comorbidity index, and PD[18]. Some studies have also investigated osteoporosis in animals, and found that once an animal has PD, its osteoporosis becomes worse than that of normal control animals. These experiments suggested that PD may contribute to the development of osteoporosis. To explore the effect of PD on osteoporosis, we used 16-week-old rats to establish a PD model. To obtain accurate experimental results, we controlled for food intake and body weight. Rats in the PD group already had PD after two weeks. We found that PD had a negative effect on bone mass and it might be a risk factor for osteoporosis. As it is secreted by osteoblasts and its levels reflect osteoblast activity, BGP is a specific marker for bone formation. CTX-1 plays an important role in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and degradation. A large number of studies have shown that serum BGP and CTX-1 levels in patients with osteoporosis are significantly higher than in controls; because of this, BGP and CTX-1 are widely used to detect osteoporosis[19]. In the present study, we collected serum from rats, and found that the serum CTX-1 levels in PD rats were higher than in WT rats. However, no significant difference in BGP levels was noted. We speculate that this was due to the relatively old rats used in our experiments, as their bone forming ability was relatively low. IL-6 and TNF-α are pleiotropic cytokines that play important roles in regulating endocrine and metabolic processes, such as inflammation and immune response[20]. Melton found that IL-6 levels in osteoporosis patients with estrogen deficiency were significantly increased. IL-6 can activate osteoclasts and accelerate bone resorption[12]. TNF-α is another major pro-inflammatory cytokine. TNF-α is involved in bone remodeling, and can exhibit synergy with other cytokines, such as IL-6, by activating the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase pathway[21], the NF-κB pathway, and the Wnt pathway[22, 23], thereby increasing the expression of osteoclast markers, sp 500 bp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w sp 500 bp 500 bp 500 bp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w sp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w sp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) sp 500 bp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) sp 500 bp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) Prevotella intermedia (Pi) sp 500 bp 250 bp 1000 bp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w sp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w sp Periodontal ligature Blood 2 w 4 w 8 w 2 w 4 w 8 w Streptococcus mutans (Sm) Treponema denticola (Td) Prevotella nigrescens (Pn) Tannerella forsythia (Tf) Campylobacter rectus (Cr) Fig. 5 Periodontal pathogen detection in periodontal ligatures and blood 16S rDNA detection of Pg, Aa, Fn, Pi, Tf, Cr, Sm, Td, and Pn by PCR in periodontal ligation silk and blood from PD rats. sp: subgingival plague 759Current Medical Science 40(4):2020 increasing the production of osteoblasts, accelerating apoptosis, and inhibiting osteogenic transformation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells[13]. Inflammation factors such as IL-6 and TNF-α activate the NF-κB pathway, which increases the expression of CTX124. In our study, we detected increased levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in the PD group and found that serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in PD rats than in WT rats after eight weeks, which were consistent with results found by previous studies[24], and it was suggested that the inflammation response may be responsible for the loss of bone mass in PD[25]. Plaque is one of the most important factors in the development of PD, as it is a “hotbed” for the growth of bacteria such as Pg and Aa, which not only have the ability to resist host defense mechanisms, but also produce powerful virulence factors, release proteases, and cause damage to tissues[26–28]. Periodontal pathogens secrete LPS and other virulence and cytostatic factors, destroy alveolar bone, and prevent periodontal defense resistance[26, 29]. The virulence factors, pathogenic enzymes, antigenic components, and their metabolites secreted by periodontal pathogens can cause an immune response in periodontal tissue as well as a systemic immune response[30]. Large amounts of IL-6 and TNF-α can be detected in the gingival crevicular fluid and blood of PD patients[24], which may occur because pathogenic bacteria can activate the expression of a variety of cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-α and IL-6, and these cytokines then stimulate monocyte activation and regulate systemic reactions[31]. In the present study, Pg, Aa, and Fn were found from the blood of PD rats, suggesting that periodontal pathogens may contribute to the loss of bone mass. In experimental animal models, Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria (such as Pg) in the periodontium can induce protein citrullination by releasing specific deaminases that may stimulate the formation of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies in RA patients[32]. When periodontal pathogens enter the systemic circulatory system, they can promote the development of systemic diseases and aggravate the disease severity. Studies have shown that bacteria have effects on bone quality. It has been reported that gut microbiota can affect the body’s immune system and regulate calcium and phosphorus absorption by secreting estrogen, serotonin, and other substances, thereby inducing changes in the body’s bone quality[33]. Sjogren also found that mice lacking intestinal flora had a higher bone density in the distal femur than normal mice, which may be because mice lacking gut flora have fewer osteoclasts, and the osteoblast numbers remain unchanged[34]. Moreover, the expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in mice lacking intestinal flora were lower than in normal mice[3]. Because periodontal pathogens have some commonality with gut microbiota, they may also affect bone mass. In summary, our study demonstrated that PD can promote the development of osteoporosis and periodontal pathogens can cause systemic bone changes, primarily due to activating a systemic immune response and increasing inflammation. Periodontal pathogens may activate the expression of various proteases, collagenases, and cytokines, as well as some pathological pathways, resulting in elevated CTX-1 levels and changing the total bone mass of the whole body. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the systemic bone changes caused by the pathogens remain to be elucidated.
