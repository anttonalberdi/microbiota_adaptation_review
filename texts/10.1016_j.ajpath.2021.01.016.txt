Akita and wild-type (C57BL/6J) male mice, 24 to 26 weeks old, were treated with or without a selective inhibitor of NF-kB, 4-methyl-N1-(3-phenyl-propyl) benzene-1,2-diamine (JSH-23), for 4 weeks. Treatment was given when the mice were at least 24 weeks old. Metabolic parameters, key inflammatory mediators, blood-retinal barrier junction molecules, retinal structure, and function were measured. JSH-23 significantly lowered basal glucose levels and intraocular pressure in Akita. It also mitigated vascular remodeling and microaneurysms significantly. Optical coherence tomography of untreated Akita showed thinning of retinal layers; however, treatment with JSH-23 could prevent it. Electroretinogram demonstrated that Aand B-waves in Akita were significantly smaller than in wild type mice, indicating that JSH-23 intervention prevented loss of retinal function. Protein levels and gene expression of key inflammatory mediators, such as NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2, were decreased after JSH-23 treatment. At the same time, connexin43 and occludin were maintained. Vision-guided behavior also improved significantly. The results show that reducing inflammation could protect the diabetic retina and its vasculature. Findings appear to have broader implications in treating not only ocular conditions but also other vasculopathies.

It occurs in approximately 1:400 to 600 US children.1 A recent trend shows a disturbing 15% to 20% increase in new diagnoses of T1D for those aged <5 years.2,3 The reason for this alarming increase is debatable. Clinically, the management of T1D has proved to be challenging for a variety of reasons, including physiological factors such as increased insulin sensitivity, especially in children.4 T1D is an inflammatory disease with microvascular complications that leads to diabetic retinopathy (DR).5 DR is generally divided into nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, an early stage wherein symptoms can be mild, moderate, or nonexistent. It is marked by the presence of microaneurysms, which may leak fluid into the retina.6 Furthermore, the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown exacerbates capillary permeability, contributing to swelling of the macula lutea, also called fovea (a part of the retina, responsible for sharp and detailed central vision;stigative Pathology. Published by Elsevier Incthe visual acuity). Without intervention, the disease can transition to proliferative diabetic, a progressive condition wherein the ischemic retina stimulates angiogenesis to drive neovascularization. If left untreated, proliferative diabetic retinopathy can cause severe vision loss or permanent blindness. DR has become a leading cause of blindness in workingage adults globally.7,8 Current interventions do not adequately address the retinovascular signature pathology that underlies initiation, progression, and maintenance of DR phenotype. Furthermore, they fail to restore vision loss in many patients. DR’s etiology remains enigmatic despite. All rights reserved. Homme et alan abundance of literature describing the impact of polyol, hexosamine pathway, advanced glycation end products, and oxidative stress. Of late DR is being considered as an inflammatory disease because a variety of inflammatory mediators have been detected in diabetic animal and human vitreous and their retinae.9 Interestingly, a substantial increase in inflammatory mediator expression is also directly associated with NF-kB (nuclear factor k-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells).10 Briefly, the nuclear factorkB is a dynamic transcription factor that orchestrates complex biological processes, including the immune system inflammatory response.11 Because of its upstream role in cell signaling, NF-kB remains a central component in inflammation. It induces cytokines and responds to stress, free radicals, heavy metals, UV irradiation, oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein, and bacterial and viral antigens. NF-kB is a first responder to harmful stimuli; it shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus to initiate and then help execute a robust gene-transcription program. It consists of a family of transcription factors: NF-kB1 (p50), NF-kB2 (p52), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel. These alone or together form heterodimers and homodimers that translocate to the nucleus. They then bind to specific DNA sequences to promote the expression of inflammatory mediators.12e15 The most prevalent heterodimer of the NF-kB family, p65/p50, plays a significant role in the inflammatory response. Recently, 4-methyl-N1-(3-phenyl-propyl) benzene-1,2-diamine (known as JSH-23) was used to inhibit the nuclear translocation of the p65/p50 heterodimer.16 JSH-23 inhibits translocation of NF-kB in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharides.14,17 JSH-23 is cell permeable and is also effective in mitigating microvascular complications (eg, neuropathy).13,14 This study aimed to determine the role of inflammation in remodeling of retinal structure and function in the Akita mouse strain and investigate whether JSH-23 can protect the diabetic retina. Hyperglycemia in T1D induces retinal inflammation via NF-kB activation. Retinal capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, and glial cells are critical parts of the BRB. They are potential targets of inflammatory mediators. These mediators also target junctional molecules, thus impairing cell-cell communication and paracellular transport. NF-kB activation increases the expression of proinflammatory genes that induce BRB breakdown.18e22 Therefore, preempting inflammation on a long-term basis by inhibiting NF-kB activity may mitigate microvascular alterations in the diabetic retina. The Ins2Akita mouse strain (Akita) was used to test this hypothesis. It is characterized as a T1D model because of its fertility, stable insulin-deficient diabetes, and no systemic immune modulation.23 Akita harbors a missense mutation in the insulin 2 gene, leading to a conformational change in the insulin protein, causing its accumulation in the pancreatic b cells. Accumulation of misfolded insulin causes severe hyperglycemia-induced inflammation due to loss function, decreased density, and death of b cells.23e26 This hyperglycemia-induced948pathology ensues with a parallel increase in acellular retinal capillaries, infiltration of leukocytes into vascular walls, thinning of the inner retinal layers, and apoptosis of retinal cells.23,27,28 Materials and Methods Animal Genotyping and Maintenance Akita (T1D Ins2Akitaþ/) mice were characterized by chronic hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. They usually develop spontaneous diabetes by 4 weeks of age. They were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Male Akita mice, 24 to 26 weeks old, were used throughout the experiments. To maintain a consistent background, wildtype (WT) littermate male mice that lack the Ins2Akita mutation were used as control. All animals were kept in a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle with a regular mouse diet at the University of Louisville School of Medicine animal facility. According to Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology guidelines, mice were cared for, as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville, Louisville, KY. The experimental protocols were performed following the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.29,30 Genotyping of the mice was performed by collecting the tail biopsy, as previously reported.31 DNA was isolated using DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). The cross-breeding yields Ins2Akita with high and low glucose levels, measured by blood glucose meter Ultra Touch 2 (Life Scan, Malvern, PA). High glucose level was defined as >300 mg/dL. Low glucose level was defined as 250 mg/dL. Only mice with high glucose levels were used in the study. Study Protocol Mice were divided into four different groups: i) WT, ii) WT þ NF-kB inhibitor (JSH-23), iii) Ins2Akita, and iv) Ins2Akita þ JSH-23. The NF-kB inhibitor (JSH-23) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO; Chemical Abstracts Service number 749886-87-1). Depending on the experiment’s nature, a minimum of 5 to 20 mice was used in each group. A stock solution of JSH-23 was prepared by diluting 25 mg JSH-23 in 1000 mL of 200 proof ethanol (Decon Labs, King of Prussia, PA; CAS number 64-17-5), and stored at 70C. A total of 100 mL of the stock solution was then diluted with 4900 mL of 1 sterile phosphatebuffered saline. The control solution was prepared with 4900 mL of 1 phosphate-buffered saline and 100 mL of 200 proof ethanol. Akita and WT mice strains were treated with or without the specific inhibitor, JSH-23, intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg body weight on alternate days for a total of 4 weeks. The treatment started once the mice were approximately 26 weeks old. The treatment protocol was chosen because of the following reasons: i) higherajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Treating Diabetes via NF-kB Inhibitionconcentrations, such as 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight, were toxic, ii) JSH-23 dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was toxic, iii) no study has reported the toxicity of JSH-23 at a higher concentration or its dilution in dimethyl sulfoxide, although a study that used higher concentration was performed for a week,32 and iv) previous studies primarily chose alternate days, and 2 weeks was the most common duration. Measurement of Blood Glucose, Glucose Tolerance Test, Blood Insulin, Body Weights, Systemic Blood Pressure, and Recording of Intraocular Pressure Blood glucose was measured with Ultra Touch 2 Glucometer (LifeScan, Malvern, PA) before and after treatment with or without JSH-23. A glucose tolerance test was performed to measure the clearance of intraperitoneally injected glucose load from the body and to detect disturbances in glucose metabolism linked to diabetes. Both WT and Akita mice fasted for 5 hours before basal blood glucose levels were determined. Glucose was then administered by i.p. injection. Subsequently, the blood glucose levels were measured at 30-minute intervals for 2 hours.33,34 The plasma insulin levels were also measured to understand glucose metabolism. Mouse INSULIN ELISA kit (EMINS) from Thermo Fischer Scientific (Waltham, MA) was used to analyze plasma insulin levels. The test was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.35 Body weights of all the animals were recorded using an electronic weighing balance, OHAUS, CS-2000 (Sigma Millipore, St. Louis, MO). Systemic blood pressure was measured with CODA noninvasive blood pressure instrument (CODA Instrument, Ken Scientific, Torrington, CT).36 The intraocular pressure (IOP) was recorded by a tonometer before and after JSH-23 treatment (iCare, Tonolab, Raleigh, NC).37 In Vivo Fluorescence Angiography Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mL of AK-FLUOR (NDC 17478-253-10; Akorn, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) after induction of anesthesia with 300 mL of 2 tribromoethanol.

Mice were dark-adapted overnight and anesthetized by i.p. injection using tribromoethanol. Pupils were then dilated with one drop of tropicamide ophthalmic solution (Akorn, Inc.). Full-field scotopic ERGs were recorded using the Tucker-Davis System Workstation (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) for the real-time visualization of averaged aand b-waves. BioSigRZ system was used for the quantification and further analysis.40,41 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed to visualize and compare the anatomic differences before and after JSH-23 treatment; Image-Guided OCT2 (Phoenix Technology Group, Pleasanton, CA) was used.42 Spectraldomain OCTs on human subjects were obtained using a macular cube protocol on the Heidelberg SPECTRALIS (Heidelberg, Germany). Other Reagents and Antibodies Chemicals and antibodies were purchased as indicated (eg, Sigma-Aldrich, Abcam, Cell Signaling Technology, or Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Details for the antibodies are as follows: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; ab15323) and NOD-like receptor family pyrin domaincontaining 3 (NLRP3; ab214185) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (4842S), total NF-kB p65 (8242S), and phosphorylated NF-kB p65 (3033S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).

The secondary antibodies were also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology [namely, rabbit anti-mouse (sc-358914), mouse anti-rabbit (sc-2357), and mouse anti-goat (sc-2354)]. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; MAB374) was purchased from EMD Millipore (Burlington, MA). All reagents and antibodies used for Western blotting were used following the manufacturers’ recommended protocols. Analysis of the Key Inflammatory Molecules in the Diabetic Retina Protein levels were detected via Western blot analyses. Retinae were separated from enucleated globes from euthanized mice. The retinal protein lysates were used immediately or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at e80C until further use. Proteins were extracted from the retinal samples via homogenizing in950radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Boston BioProducts, Worcester, MA) coupled with a cocktail of 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1% protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma). The samples were then sonicated with Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT). The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000  g for 15 minutes at 4C, and the resultant supernatants were collected and stored at e80C. Bradford assay was used to estimate the total protein contents. Per sample, 40 mg of total protein was resolved on a 10% SDSPAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight and then with secondary antibodies the next day for 3 hours before visualization with ECL Luminata Forte (Millipore, Temecula, CA) via a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc system (BioRad Laboratories, Des Plains, IL). Band intensities were normalized to GAPDH for all the target proteins analyzed, and their respective quantifications were performed through Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).43ajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Figure 2 Effect of JSH-23 on systemic blood pressure and intraocular pressure (IOP).

Treating Diabetes via NF-kB InhibitionQuantitative PCR RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) based on the manufacturer’s instructions. Nanodrop-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to analyze RNA quantification and purity. ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (A300; Promega, Madison, WI) was used to reverse transcribe the total RNA into cDNA per manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed for different transcripts (RelA, ICMA1, iNOS, COX-2, NLRP3, Casp1, IL-1B, Cx43, Occludin, and GAPDH ). The final reaction included 10 mL of nucleasefree water, 8 mL of Bullseye EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix (BEQPCR-S; MIDSCI, Valley Park, MO), 50 pmol of forward and reverse primers in 1 mL, and 1 mL of cDNA (Table 144e50). Data were normalized with the housekeeping gene GAPDH.51 The Light-Dark Chamber Movement Test Individual animals were subjected to the light-dark box test. The PACS Shuttle Box Version 3.40 (Passive/Active Avoidance Chamber System-30; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) was set up in experiment mode as passive avoidance, with unified computing system grid intensity (amperes), 0; exploration duration, 30 seconds; maximal trial duration, 5 minutes; conditioned stimulus light intensity, 10 V; and unified computing system grid duration, 2 seconds. After 30 seconds of exploration, the light flickered on. The time taken for the mouse to transfer from the light chamber to the dark was measured.52 Human FA and OCT Measurements Images of FA from a normal and a diabetic human eye are provided for comparison with Akita mice. Fundus FA was performed as part of routine clinical care of human patientsThe American Journal of Pathology ajp.amjpathol.orgusing the Heidelberg SPECTRALIS fundus camera after injecting sodium fluorescein 10% intravenously (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). The diabetic and the nondiabetic persons underwent a full dilated eye examination and spectral-domain OCT (Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT 5000; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) of a 6  6-mm area of the macula in their eyes. The images were analyzed and classified as either normal or having diabetic macular edema. Statistical Analysis All values are reported as means  SEM. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences between the groups, including the Tukey post hoc analysis for group comparisons. The tests were performed with P < 0.05, and the total number of mice, at least nZ 5 to 20, was subjected to experimentations from each group. GraphPad Prism version 8.3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used during analyses. Results Confirmation of Ins2Akita Mutation in the Expanded Mouse Colony and Determination of the Effect of JSH23 on Glucose Metabolism Tail-clip DNA samples were analyzed using PCR with specific primers to determine the genotype of newly bred pups. The mutated version of the insulin gene exhibited two discrete bands: 280 and 140 bp, representing Akita mice’s heterozygous status, whereas WT mice showed one 140-bp band (Figure 1A).31 Akita mice’s blood glucose levels were significantly higher than those of WT mice (P < 0.0001; n Z 15 per group), and JSH-23 decreased these levels in Akita mice (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1B). Akita mice displayed significantly lower plasma insulin levels than in WT mice951 Figure 3 Anti-inflammatory effects of JSH-23 on retinal vasculature.

As expected, the i.p. glucose tolerance test showed high glucose levels in Akita mice than in WT mice. Furthermore, i.p. glucose tolerance test also indicated that the Akita strain was unable to lower its blood glucose levels (P < 0.0090; n Z 5 per group) (Figure 1D). The body weights were measured before and after JSH-23 treatment. Akita mice body weights were significantly lower than age-matched WT control mice; JSH-23 had no effect on body weights (Figure 1E). This could be a result of a decrease in their lean mass compared with WT control littermates, most likely as a function of age.53 Monitoring of Blood Pressure and IOP Systemic blood pressure and IOP were evaluated before and after treatment with JSH-23. JSH-23 is known to increase blood pressure in hypertriglyceridemic rats.54 Therefore, it was imperative to determine whether JSH-23 alters the952systemic blood pressure of the mice. Treated and untreated mice were subjected to a noninvasive tail-cuff method for recording their blood pressure. None of the mice acquired a statistically significant change in systemic blood pressure (n Z 8 per group) (Figure 2A); however, IOP was higher in Akita mice than in age-matched WT control mice (P < 0.0001; n Z 12 per group). Intervention with JSH-23 decreased the elevated IOP significantly in the Akita mice group (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2B). Assessment of Retinal Vasculature by Angiography and Fundoscopy Retinal vascular leakage is exacerbated by inflammation, making inflammation a key component in DR pathology. FA was employed to study the anti-inflammatory effects of JSH-23 on the retinal vasculature in vivo.27 Akita mice’s retinal vasculature indicated microaneurysms and increased vascular permeability (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group). JSH-ajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Treating Diabetes via NF-kB Inhibition23 treatment prevented vascular impairments, depicting low vascular permeability in this mouse strain (P < 0.0001) (Figure 3, A and B). FA images taken from a healthy human and a patient with T1D eyes are shown for comparison (Figure 3C). The optic nerve is eccentric from the center of the fundus in humans. DR leakage occurs predominantly around the fovea in humans, indicating the center of macula. Multiple microaneurysms were observed in both human and mouse eyes.Evaluation of In Vivo ERG and OCT Full-field scotopic ERGs evaluated functional changes in the retina of WT and Akita mice. BioSigRZ system was used for real-time visualization of the averaged Aand B-waves. Akita mice demonstrated widened but truncated Aand B-waves in contrast to the sharp Aand B-waves in WT mice (Figure 4A). The A-wave amplitude in the retinae of Akita mice decreased (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group); however, the treatment with JSH-23 prevented a decrease in the A-wave amplitude in Akita mice (P < 0.0001)Figure 4 A: Electroretinograms (ERGs) of wild-type (WT) and Akita (AK) mice tr when superimposed on top of each other mark the relative differences in amplitude and WT mice with or without JSH-23 n Z 6 (B and C). ****P < 0.0001.

The B-wave amplitude in Akita mice also decreased (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group); JSH-23 treatment prevent this decrease in B-wave amplitude in Akita mice (P < 0.0001) (Figure 4C). The retinal structural integrity was evaluated with realtime, image-guided optical OCT in Akita mice. It displayed hyporeflective retinal lucency and abnormal thickening of membrana limitans interna, inner nervous stratum opticum, and the ganglionic layer. Also, there was a focal discontinuity in the retinal pigment epithelium captured by MicronIV OCT2 in Akita mice (Figure 5A). These alterations were prevented by JSH-23 treatment (Figure 5B). Figure 5C depicts the healthy eye versus a diabetic eye from a T1D patient, highlighting diabetic macular edema.Treatment with JSH-23 Diminishes Key Inflammatory Molecules in the Diabetic Retina To examine the effects of NF-kB inhibition in mice retinae, Western blotting and quantitative PCR analyses of the retinal lysates from JSH-23-treated and untreated mice wereeated or untreated with JSH-23.

Similarly, ICAM-1 protein levels (P < 0.0218; n Z 6 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0003; n Z 5 per group) were elevated in the retinae of Akita mice; JSH-23 treatment decreased both the protein levels (P < 0.0028) and gene expression (P< 0.0001; nZ 5 per group) (Figure 7, A and B, and Figure 8A). The iNOS protein levels (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0012; nZ 5 per group) were also higher in the retinae of Akita mice. JSH-23 decreased both the protein levels (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group) and the gene expression954(P < 0.0031; n Z 5 per group) (Figure 7, A and B, and Figure 8B). In addition, COX-2 protein levels (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0004; n Z 5 per group) were higher in the retinae of Akita mice. JSH-23 treatment decreased both the levels of COX-2 protein (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0001; n Z 5 per group) (Figures 7C and 8C). NLRP3 protein levels (P < 0.0180; n Z 6 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0025; n Z 6 per group) were higher in the retinae of Akita mice.

The genes for casp1 (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group) and IL-1B (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group) had increased expression in the retinae of Akita mice.

Treating Diabetes via NF-kB InhibitionJSH-23 Maintained Integrity of the Tight and Gap Junctions along with Barrier Function Proteins in Diabetic Retina Hyperglycemia-induced down-regulation of connexin-43 severely affects gap junction intercellular communication in blood vessels. Therefore, it contributes to the breakdown of endothelial tight junctions in DR.55 Occludin and connexin-43 protein levels and their gene expression were analyzed by employing Western blotting and real-time PCR. Connexin-43 protein levels (P < 0.0165; n Z 5 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0003; n Z 5 per group) were significantly decreased in the retina of Akita. JSH-23treatment maintained connexin-43 protein levels (P < 0.0006; n Z 5 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0237; n Z 5 per group) in the retinae of Akita mice (Figure 10, A, B, and D). Similarly, occludin protein levels (P < 0.0068; n Z 5 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0073; n Z 5 per group) were significantly decreased in the retinae of Akita mice. JSH-23 prevented the degradation of the protein (P < 0.0071; n Z 5 per group) and gene expression (P < 0.0060; n Z 5 per group) of occludin in the Akita mice (Figure 10, A, C, and E). Evaluation of Vision-Guided Behavior in JSH23eTreated Mice The mice were evaluated for their vision-guided behavior by employing a light-dark chamber analysis. It took Akita mice significantly longer to move from the light chamberThe American Journal of Pathology ajp.amjpathol.orginto the dark chamber (P < 0.0001; n Z 8 per group) relative to WT mice. However, JSH-23 significantly decreased the time Akita mice took to move from the light chamber to the dark chamber (P < 0.0477; n Z 8 per group) (Figure 11). Discussion T1D leads to a predisposition to long-term medical complications, including blindness. Twenty years after diagnosis, approximately 98% of T1D patients exhibit DR pathology.56 As a result, DR is becoming a serious medical problem globally. Currently there is no cure for DR. Early detection and intervention can reduce the risk, but vision loss can be irreversible for many. Research has identified several options to manage DR symptoms, but not all T1D patients benefit from them. In this study, mitigating inflammation via blocking NF-kB activity demonstrated that specific targeting of inflammation over a longer period could help prevent retinal complications in the diabetic eye. Thus, the findings highlight that targeted intervention could help mitigate retinopathy. Overall, JSH-23 alleviated retinovascular remodeling, including permeability, indicating that inhibition of inflammation via NF-kB helps protect the diabetic retina.23,25e27,57e62 Activation of NF-kB and its subsequent nuclear translocation can be separated from other biological processes, thus allowing an opportunity to test its targeting, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. The current study used a T1D model that shows degenerative changes in the955 Figure 7 Immunoblotting of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 proteins.

GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Homme et alretinal architecture, including its vasculature.63 To test this hypothesis, WT and Akita (Ins2Akita) mice were treated with JSH-23 for 4 weeks continuously. Several disease indicators and parameters (eg, IOP, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, retinal structure, visual function, and inflammatory mediators) were evaluated, including vision-guided behavioral analysis. FA, OCT, and ERG were employed to assess structural and functional aspects of the retina. JSH-23 significantly decreased retinal vasculopathy in the retinae of Akita mice. FA showed that JSH-23 prevented an increase in vascular leakage in Akita mice. Interestingly, 4 weeks of intervention with JSH-23 was sufficient to avoid any change in retinal thickness after >20 weeks of hyperglycemia. It is imperative to analyze whether the retinal thickness/ biomass lost can be recovered after JSH-23 intervention in the Akita mice. The OCT measurements of the central retinae showed that JSH-23 treatment was able to prevent the degradation of retinal layers in Akita mice. It would be of great significance to analyze further the effect(s) of JSH-23 on retinal degeneration phenotype in the aged/old mice. However, in this study, the decrease in pathologic956changes in the retinae of Akita mice was appreciable for potentially delaying the further retinal pathology, the onset of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and vision loss in these mice (Figure 3, A and B, Figure 4, A and B, and Figure 5, A and B). Inflammation in the retinal vasculature was significantly diminished. Key inflammatory mediators (eg, ICAM-1, iNOS, and COX-2) were analyzed in Akita mice retina. NF-kB p65 or RelA contain the conserved Rel homology domain, which plays a role in dimerization and DNA binding. RelA generally heterodimerizes with NF-kB p50 subunits and contains the transactivating domains. The transactivating domain functions in the transcriptional activity of the dimers. Once activated, NF-kB undergoes various modifications, including acetylation and methylation. However, phosphorylation is critical in regulating NFkB activity. Although NF-kB phosphorylation does not act as an on or off switch, the site phosphorylation regulates certain NF-kB activity.64 RelA is known to be phosphorylated in many places (eg, serine 205, 276, and 281 in the Rel homology domain). These sites phosphorylate via various kinases, such as protein kinase A.65ajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Figure 8 Gene expression profiling for ICAM-1 (A), iNOS (B), and COX-2 (C) markers in Akita mice, corroborating the findings of the respective proteins in the Akita (Figure 7) after JSH-23 treatment. n Z 5 (AeC). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. WT, wild type. Treating Diabetes via NF-kB InhibitionJSH-23 inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65/ p50, thus inhibiting the most prevalent heterodimers of NF-kB inflammatory response. Kumar et al13 showed that JSH-23 inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65/p50 in streptozotocin-induceddiabetic rats at 3mg/kg after 2weeks of oral administration. Chi et al66 showed that JSH-23 injected into the vitreous inhibited phosphorylated NF-kB p65 and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a glaucoma mouse model. The study showed that the ratio of phosphorylated NFkBp65/total NF-kBp65was significantly reduced in the retina of Akita mice, potentially indicating that JSH-23 is a selective and specific inhibitor. Mattioli et al67 showed that phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 at serine 536 in the cytoplasm inhibits nuclear translocation, the exact mechanism of which (whether or not it is site-specific) is yet to be. It is important to analyze that ratio through a nuclear extract of the retina treated with JSH-23. Currently, the JSH-23 effect is typically analyzed via nuclear extract, like in Kumar et al,13 or cytoplasmic extract, like in Chi et al.66 Treatment with JSH-23 unexpectedly decreased blood glucose levels in Akita however, it could be due to increased insulin sensitivity in Akita mice. A decrease in inflammation increases insulin sensitivity. Hyperglycemia activates NF-The American Journal of Pathology ajp.amjpathol.orgkB, increasing insulin resistance, and chemical or genetic inhibition improves insulin resistance.68 This study also demonstrated that treatment with JSH-23 can decrease IOP in Akita mice. Multiple demographic studies have indicated an increase in IOP in diabetic patients versus nondiabetic patients. This increase in IOP is independent of open-angle glaucoma; however, the mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Glycosylated hemoglobin can cause an osmotic gradient that shifts fluid between plasma and the intraocular, thus elevating the IOP. A Japanese study found a significant correlation between IOP and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with DR.69 A Chinese population study also found an association of glycosylated hemoglobin with high IOP (>21 mmHg).70 Additionally a demographic study in Singapore found an association showing elevated IOP. Even after accounting for the difference in central corneal thickness, which is higher in diabetic individuals, the IOP increase was independent of glaucoma development. The current study showed no change in the systemic blood pressure of mice. One of the significant findings of this work is that mitigating inflammation most likely helped improve Akita’s vision, scored via the vision-guided behavioral test.957 Figure 9 Immunoblotting and gene expression analyses.

Homme et alThis data set indicates that controlling inflammation can potentially help decrease retinal inflammatory insults, thereby improving structural and functional attributes of the diabetic retina. NF-kB regulates the survival, activation, and differentiation of immune cells. It has also been implicated in other processes, including synaptic plasticity.10,71,72 Some of the essential targets of NF-kB include iNOS, ICAMs, and growth factors. Many NF-kB targets are inflammatory mediators associated with the development of retinopathy in diabetic patients. Notably, iNOS-meditated nitric oxide production from L-arginine primarily mediates inflammation. Physiological production of nitric oxide is generated by the action of neuronal and endothelial synthases.73 Although iNOS is not expressed in most resting cells, it has high expression in activated immune cells.74 Activated958NF-kB induces transcription of iNOS because increased iNOS levels have been reported in the retinae of diabetic animals.10 Increase in iNOS is associated with apoptosis, leukostasis, and BRB breakdown.75 Studies on retinal cells exposed to high glucose concentrations demonstrate that nitric oxide (particularly iNOS-generated) increases other inflammatory mediators, such as COX-2.23 Cyclooxygenases mediate eicosanoid synthesis. Their primary function is to generate prostaglandins. COX-1 maintains the physiological production of eicosanoids.76 COX-2 remains absent from most tissues and its expression increases in the presence of lipopolysaccharides and proinflammatory cytokines. COX2 exhibits higher expression in monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.76 NF-kB activation up-regulates COX-2 gene expression in retinal cells; and high COX-2ajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Figure 10 Connexin-43 and occludin protein levels and their gene expression analyses in wild-type (WT) mice and Akita (AK) mice treated with JSH-23 (J).

Treating Diabetes via NF-kB Inhibitionexpression is associated with BRB breakdown.77,78 COX2 expression increased in Akita mice retinae.79 Other inflammatory mediators regulated by NF-kB and with increased expression in the diabetic retinae are ICAMs, particularly ICAM-1. ICAML-1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that plays an essential role during immune response, such as leukocyte trafficking.80 ICAM-1 is expressed in endothelial cells, leukocytes, platelets, epithelial cells, and glial cells. It functions in cell adhesion, migration, and aggregation; and its activity andThe American Journal of Pathology ajp.amjpathol.orgexpression are usually low when inflammation is absent.81 In diabetes, leukocyte adhesion to the retinal endothelium is the primary mechanism of leukostasis, presumably mediated by the up-regulation of ICAM-1. NF-kB activation increased ICAM-1 expression. A high level of ICAM1einduced leukocyte adhesion to retinal vascular endothelium via Eand P-selectin causes leukostasis in the retinal vasculature.82,83 Hence, increased leukostasis is associated with enhanced vascular permeability.84e87 Furthermore, the959 Figure 11 The light-dark chamber movement test for Akita and wildtype (WT) mice treated with JSH-23.

Figure 12 A schematic showing vision impairment as a result of NFkBeinitiated ocular inflammation during type 1 diabetes. The hyperglycemic environment leads to dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, causing significant increase in inflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, in the retinae and concomitant NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) activation. The resultant inflammatory signature induces degradation of the junctional protein molecules and concurrent death of the retinal cells via pyroptosis. The structural and physiological alterations in the retinal vasculature result in a corresponding decrease in the contents responsible for retinovascular junction integrity, encompassing junctional molecules (connexin-43 and occludin), leading to retinal remodeling. The assembly of NF-kBeinitiated NLRP3 inflammasome eventually leads to the derailment of the bloodretinal barrier (BRB), causing vision impairment and blindness. Treatment with JSH-23, an inhibitor of NF-kB p65 subunit, mitigates the debilitating effects of diabetic retinopathy because JSH-23 can decrease inflammatory mediators significantly, thus protecting the retina during diabetes. Homme et alinhibition of ICAM-1 reduces retinal vascular leakage and leukocyte adhesion in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat.88 Prominent inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, COX-2, and ICAM-1, are elevated in diabetic retinae, as also shown in this study. These molecules have been associated with BRB breakdown, leading to increased retinal vascular permeability that potentially contributes to IOP elevation. High glucose down-regulated the expression of connexin-43, and 26, thus reducing the intercellular communication between gap junctions. Decreased cell-cell communication is associated with BRB dysfunction.89 In addition, low expression of connexin-43 is concurrently related to down-regulation of other junctional proteins (eg, occludin and zonula occludens protein 1).89 Importantly, the suppressive effect of diabetes supports a transcriptional effect on the status of the occludin rather than a posttranscriptional one.90 Various regulatory mechanisms highly influence the connexin-43 gene and its mRNA expression.91e95 Retinal pigment epithelium and retinal endothelial cells constitute a critical component of the BRB. Inflammation can lead to subretinal and intraretinal fluid accumulation. Numerous mechanisms have been implicated in dysfunction of the endothelial cells in diabetes. BRB breakdown is strongly associated with the release of proinflammatory factors, such as iNOS, and elevated levels of inflammatory mediators play a definitive role in raising the IOP. In addition, elevated IOP is linked with up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, tumor necrosis factor-a, ILs, and vascular endothelial growth factor.96960Conclusions The incidence of T1D is rising, and glycemic variability is becoming more common among young children. This has long-term implications for the health and well-being of diabetic patients. Research has identified several potential options to cure diabetes but so far none of them has shown any concrete outcome.97e102 Thus, targeted interventions are needed to reduce the risk of long-term T1D-related complications and improve patient quality of life. NF-kB is a key player in the inflammatory process; thus, strategies inhibiting NF-kB have potential therapeutic applications in fighting against T1D. This study showed that inhibition of NF-kB significantly diminished cell-junctional molecule degradation in the retinae of Akita mice, thereby decreasing vascular permeability and retinal remodeling (Figure 12). IOP was also mitigated, and visual function improved, as shown by vision-guided behavior test when inflammation in the eye was controlled. It is notable that JSH-23 treatment has been shown to abate the inflammatory response to injuryajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Treating Diabetes via NF-kB Inhibitionin other model systems.103 It is also worth mentioning that various types of both steroidal and nonsteroidal (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) agents have been demonstrated to inhibit NF-kB, but their actions are highly pleiotropic.104,105 Therefore, one of the major challenges facing scientists is to develop NF-kB inhibitor(s) aimed at treating different diseases based on their ability to target specific pathway(s) in specific disease condition(s) such as DR, with small molecules like JSH-23, thereby avoiding the risk of undesired clinical adverse effects. We hope that the findings of this study will lead the way in validating newer approaches in the near future. This study advances understanding of the role of inflammation in DR. However, additional studies are needed to determine the best way to deliver the JSH-23 compound or its versions directly into the eye in a long-acting manner.Acknowledgments We thank members of The Eye and Vision Science Laboratory, Department of Physiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY for continuous support and encouragement.
