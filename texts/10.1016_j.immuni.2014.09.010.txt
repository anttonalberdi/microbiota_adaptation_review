Here, we report a critical role for interleukin-22 (IL-22) in systemic protection against bacterial pathobionts that translocate into the circulation after infection with the pathogen Clostridiumdifficile. InfectionwithC. difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22/ mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. Pathobionts exhibited increased resistant against complementmediated phagocytosis, and their intravenous administration resulted in high animal mortality. Selective removal of translocated commensals rescued Il22/ mice, and IL-22 administration enhanced the elimination of pathobionts. Mechanistically, IL-22 augmented bacterial phagocytosis by increasing the expression and bacterial binding of complement C3. Our study demonstrates an unexpected role for IL-22 in controlling the elimination of pathobionts that enter the systemic circulation through the regulation of the complement system. INTRODUCTION The intestine of humans and animals harbors diverse microbial species that provide numerous benefits to their hosts (Kamada et al., 2013; Round and Mazmanian, 2009). However, the gut microbiota also includes potentially virulent species, called pathobionts, that can cause disease when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted, particularly in immunocompromised hosts (Chow and Mazmanian, 2010; Kamada et al., 2013). Indeed, disruption of the healthy microbiota by several mechanisms, including antibiotic treatment, results in dysbiosis, which can lead to the accumulation of pathobionts and disease (Kamada et al., 2013; Pham620 Immunity 41, 620–632, October 16, 2014 ª2014 Elsevier Inc.and Lawley 2014). However, the mechanisms whereby pathobionts give rise to disease remain poorly understood. Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that overgrows during dysbiosis in patients who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics and causes infectious diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis (Carroll and Bartlett 2011). The severity ofC. difficile infection varies frommild diarrhea to septic shock and multiple organ failure, associated with high mortality (Eaton and Mazuski, 2013; Sunenshine and McDonald, 2006). Moreover, even after treatment with antibiotics such as vancomycin and metronidazole, which eradicate C. difficile, 7% of patients will still die fromC. difficile infection (Carroll and Bartlett, 2011). Although the cause of severe complications and mortality associated with C. difficile infection remains poorly understood, animal studies suggest that commensal bacteria contribute to disease severity. For example, after C. difficile infection, mice lacking interleukin-1b (IL-1b), inflammasome components, or the innate immune receptor Nod1 exhibit high mortality associated with impaired neutrophil recruitment to areas of intestinal damage and increased translocation of commensal bacteria (Hasegawa et al., 2011; Hasegawa et al., 2012). Thus, translocated commensal bacteria might contribute to C. difficileinfection-induced mortality, but the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria from the intestine accumulate in extraintestinal tissues and the immune factors that protect the host against their accumulation remain largely unknown. IL-22, a cytokine produced by RORgt+ innate lymphoid cells, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, Th22 cells, and gd T cells, has been implicated in the control of commensal bacteria in the intestine (Sonnenberg et al., 2011). Secretion of IL-22 from intestinal immune cells is regulated by IL-23 and IL-1b, the latter of which is produced largely via the inflammasome (Sutton et al., 2009). IL-22 enhances the expression of antimicrobial proteins that limit the association between certain intestinal bacteria and the epithelium (Brandl et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008). Furthermore, IL22 regulates the repair of damaged epithelium and maintains homeostasis of the microbiota (Sa et al., 2007, Zheng et al., 2008). Moreover, IL-22 plays an important role in host protection against enteropathogens, such as Citrobacter rodentium (Aujla et al., 2008; Basu et al., 2012; Satoh-Takayama et al., 2008; Schulz et al., 2008). Unlike C. difficile infection, which induces Immunity IL-22-Mediated Systemic Elimination of Pathobiontsacute intestinal dysfunction through the production of epithelium-damaging toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB, respectively) (Kuehne et al., 2010), intestinal disease triggered by C. rodentium develops more slowly, and pathogen clearance is dependent on acquired immunity (Mundy et al., 2005). Here, we report that IL-22-deficient mice exhibited increased mortality after oral infection withC. difficile, andmice were rescued by selective antibiotic treatment that removed commensal bacteria, but not C. difficile. The intestinal burden of C. difficile and the extent of intestinal damage were not altered in infected Il22/ mice. Instead, IL-22 enhanced the expression of complement C3, which contributed to the clearance of specific pathobionts from peripheral organs. Hence, our study underscores a critical role for IL-22 in protecting the host beyond the intestine by facilitating the systemic clearance of intestinal pathobionts. RESULTS IL-22-Deficient Mice Are More Susceptible to C. difficile Infection To assess the role of IL-22 in C. difficile-induced colitis, we infected antibiotic-treated mice with the pathogen that recapitulates many of the disease features observed in humans (Chen et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2011). We detected increased production of IL-22 in the intestine, lung, and liver of mice 24 hr after infection with C. difficile (Figure 1A). We also detected marginal induction of IL-17 in cecum afterC. difficile infection (Figure S1A, available online). To assess the source of increased IL-22, we infected Rag1/ mice, which lack T and B cells, and found that increased IL-22 amounts afterC. difficile infection were independent of RAG1, whereas no significant IL-17 induction was detected in the absence of RAG1 (Figures S1A and S1B). This suggests that the source of increased IL-22 is innate cells, but not mature T and B cells, including Th17, Th22, and gd T cells. To investigate the role of IL-22 in host protection during C. difficile infection, we assessed the survival of Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection and found strikingly higher mortality rates in Il22/ mice than in wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 1B). We also found no significant impact of RAG1 deficiency on mouse survival afterC. difficile infection (Figure S1C), suggesting that T-cell-derived cytokines, including IL-17 in this case, are dispensable for protection againstC. difficile infection. To understand the cause of increasedmortality in Il22/mice associated with C. difficile infection, we analyzed tissue histology and found a similar degree of intestinal damage, including epithelial disruption, submucosal edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells (including neutrophils), in Il22/ and WT mice 3 days after C. difficile infection (Figures 1C–1E). Consistently, flow cytometric analysis showed similar numbers of neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6G+) and macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) in the intestines of Il22/ and WT mice 2 days after C. difficile infection (Figures 1F–1H). Additionally, Il22/ andWTmice produced comparable amounts of CXCL1, a chemokine that is important in the recruitment of neutrophils (Figure 1I). We also found comparable weight loss in Il22/ and WT mice and similar numbers of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in the intestinal epithelium after C. difficile infection (Figures S1D–S1F). These results indicate that deficiency of IL-22 does not affect the extent of intestinal damage or recruitment of inflammatory cells after C. difficileinfection and suggest that IL-22 contributes to protection against C. difficile-infection-induced mortality through other host defense mechanisms. Reduction of Gammaenterobacteria Protects IL-22Deficient Mice from Lethality after C. difficile Infection The observation that Il22/ andWTmice exhibit comparable intestinal epithelial damage and inflammatory response after C. difficile infection suggests that epithelial damage per se is unlikely to be the main factor that leads to the death of infected Il22/ mice. Furthermore, similar numbers of C. difficile were found in the feces of infected Il22/ and WT mice (Figure S1G), indicating that IL-22 does not protect the host by promoting clearance of C. difficile in the intestine. In addition, C. difficile was not detected in the lung or liver of Il22/ mice, indicating that the increased mortality of Il22/ mice was not caused by systemic translocation of C. difficile itself (Figure S1H). Analysis of the gut microbiota by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that IL-22 deficiency did not significantly alter the composition of the fecal microbiota in uninfected and C. difficile-infected mice (Figures S1I–SK, Table S1). We also found that IL-22 deficiency did not affect the survival rate of mice infected with a streptomycin-resistant strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, whose robust colonization requires elimination of commensals by streptomycin treatment (Figure S1L). We therefore hypothesized that IL-22 might play an important role in the systemic clearance of translocated commensal bacteria after C. difficile infection. To test this, we determined the numbers of commensals in extraintestinal organs of Il22/ and WT mice before and after C. difficile infection. Notably, increased numbers of commensals were detected in all organs tested, despite similar amounts of fecal bacteria in Il22/ and WT mice (Figure 2A, Figure S1G). Because no significant differences in bacterial numbers were found between the organs of uninfected Il22/ and WT mice (Figure 2A), these results indicate that in the absence of IL-22, C. difficile infection results in increased numbers of commensals in extraintestinal tissues. Consistently, the concentrations of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), which are markers of liver damage, were significantly higher in Il22/ mice than in WT mice 3 days after C. difficile infection (Figures 2B and 2C), most likely reflecting tissue damage associated with increased burdens of translocated bacteria in the liver of Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection. Collectively, these results indicate that IL-22 regulates the clearance of translocated intestinal bacteria in extraintestinal organs after C. difficile infection. To determine the contribution of translocated commensals to the pathogenesis ofC. difficile infection, we investigated next the survival rate ofC. difficile-infected Il22/mice in the absence or presence of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that effectively kills many commensals, but not C. difficile, in vitro (Figure S1M). Quantitative PCR analysis using bacterial-group-specific primers showed that ciprofloxacin treatment reduced the numbers of total bacteria and enterobacteria 8-fold and 30-fold, respectively, but it did not affect the numbers ofC. difficile in feces (Figure 2D). Histological analysis showed that C. difficile infection induced a similar degree of epithelial damage and submucosal edema in ciprofloxacin-treated and control mice (Figure S1N), which is consistent with comparable numbers of C. difficile inImmunity 41, 620–632, October 16, 2014 ª2014 Elsevier Inc. 621 Figure 1.

Immunity IL-22-Mediated Systemic Elimination of Pathobiontsantibiotic-treated and untreated mice. Notably, ciprofloxacin treatment completely rescued Il22/ mice from C. difficileinfection-induced lethality (Figure 2E). Importantly, ciprofloxacin treatment dramatically reduced the number of bacteria translocated in extraintestinal organs after C. difficile infection (Figure 2F). Furthermore, Illumina sequencing revealed that ciprofloxacin treatment strongly reduced the number of Enterobacteriales species in the liver and feces (Figure 2G). Taken together, these results suggest that translocated commensal bacteria after C. difficile infection contribute to the death of Il22/ mice, which can be rescued by ciprofloxacin treatment to limit the extent of commensal-bacteria translocation. Translocation of Specific Species of Pathobionts after C. difficile Infection Contributes to Lethality in IL-22Deficient Mice To investigate the role of individual bacterial species in C. difficile-induced disease, we further characterized the composition of the bacteria present in the liver of C. difficile-infected Il22/ mice and isolated dominant bacteria from the organs of C. difficile-infected mice to assess their pathogenicity. The most abundant bacteria in the liver after C. difficile infection were Enterobacteriaceae species (including several belonging to the Enterobacter cloacae complex), Klebsiella pneumonia, and Escherichia coli (Figure 2G). These bacteria represented 89% of anaerobically cultivable bacterial species detected as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in Figure 2G. In addition, Lactobacillales species, including Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus murinus, were identified as the second dominant (1% of total bacteria) group in the liver after C. difficile infection (Figure 2G). To evaluate the ability of these dominant bacterial species to cause lethality, we infected WT mice with individual bacterial clones by intravenous (i.v.) administration to mimic bacterial translocation after C. difficile infection. WT mice infected with enterobacterial species isolated from the tissues of C. difficile-infected Il22/ mice (NI1077, NI1107, NI1078, and NI1188) died by day 3 after bacterial administration (Figure 3A), whereas all mice infected with two Lactobacillales species (NI1079 and NI1118) also isolated from the liver survived (Figure 3A). Importantly, i.v. administration of the same number of 16S rRNA phylotype-matched enterobacterial strains (NI796 and NI1185) isolated from the mouse feces did not result in lethality (Figure 3A). These results suggest that pathogenicity of enterobacterial species is strain dependent. Consistently, administration of pathobiont strains, but not that of control phylotype-matched strains of Enterobacteriaceae, induced liver damage, as assessed by ALT and AST concentrations in serum (Figures 3B and 3C).

Enterobacterial Pathobionts Isolated from C. difficileInfected Il22–/– Mice Are Resistant to ComplementMediated Phagocytosis The differential ability of individual commensals to induce tissue damage and lethality in vivo could be due to differences in cytotoxicity. However, both pathobiont and nonpathobiont commensal strains showed similar cytotoxicity and cytokine induction in vitro (Figures S2A–S2C). Therefore, we hypothesized that pathobiont strains possess a unique ability to escape elimination from host tissues. To test this, we determined the survival of individual commensals after i.v. administration into WT mice. Comparison of bacterial numbers in the blood, liver, and lung of infected mice showed that pathobionts had higher survival rates than control commensal bacterial strains (Figure 4A, Figure S3A). Moreover, the survival rates of individual commensals were proportional to their ability to induce host lethality and organ damage, as revealed by release of AST and ALT into the circulation after inoculation in mice (Figure 3). These results suggest that pathobionts cause detrimental tissue damage by evading host protective immunity. Previous studies have showna critical role for neutrophils in the elimination of translocated commensals at intestinal sites in the mouse model of C. difficile infection (Hasegawa et al., 2010; Hasegawa et al., 2012). Therefore, we hypothesized that the enterobacterial pathobionts isolated from Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection have the ability to avoid elimination by neutrophils or other phagocytic cells. Indeed, isolated pathobionts were more resistant than control phylotype-matched commensal strains to both killing by neutrophils (Figure 4B) and phagocytosis by macrophages (Figure 4C). To determine more comprehensively the susceptibility to phagocytosis of translocated pathobionts that survived in organs such as the liver after C. difficile infection, we examined the sensitivity to phagocytosis of 100 randomly selected bacterial clones isolated from the livers and feces of Il22/ mice 3 days after C. difficile infection. The proportion of phagocytosis-resistant commensal clones was significantly higher in the livers of C. difficile-infected Il22/ mice than in the feces of the same mice (Figure S3B). These results suggest that some translocated commensals are able to evade phagocytosis and thus survive in the mouse organs after C. difficile infection. Phagocytosis of bacteria is facilitated by opsonization with immunoglobulins (Igs) and complement factors (Noris and Remuzzi 2013). Therefore, we tested the ability of the sera from Rag1/ andC3/mice, which are deficient in Ig production and all complement pathways, respectively (Noris and Remuzzi 2013), to facilitate phagocytosis of pathobionts and control commensals. The sera from C3/ mice poorly promoted the phagocytosis ofn the analysis of ceca on day 3 postinfection.

In contrast, the sera from Rag1/ and WT mice showed a similar ability to facilitate phagocytosis of both groups of bacteria (Figure 4D). These results suggest that C3, but not antibodies, is important for phagocytosis of commensal bacteria. To test whether pathobionts are less susceptible to complement-mediated phagocytosis by inhibiting either C3 activation or C3 deposition on their surface, we incubated the bacteria in fresh murine serum as a complement source for 30 min. After incubation, we detected comparable production of C3 subfragments by immunoblotting, suggesting that pathobiont and control bacterial strains elicit similar complement activation (Figure 4E, lower panel). To assess the amounts of C3 subfragments deposited on bacteria, we removed unbound C3 by extensive washing and immunoblotted bacterial extracts with anti-C3 antibody. Notably, C3 deposition was lower in pathobionts than in phylotype-matched commensals (Figure 4E, upper panel). These results indicate that pathobionts exhibit a reduced ability to induce C3 deposition but a similar ability to induce C3 processing. Similar amounts of bacteria-bound C3 were detected when bacteria were incubated with serum fromRag1/ andWTmice (Fig-deaths were observed beyond 5 days after infection.

See also Figu Immunity 41, 620–632ures S3C and S3D), indicating that C3 deposition by commensals is dependent on the lectin or alternative pathway, but not the classical Ig-mediated pathway. To further test which complement pathway is involved in C3 deposition on commensal bacteria, we tested the ability of commensals to bind mannose-binding lectin (MBL) proteins, which are responsible for C3 deposition in the lectinpathway (Noris and Remuzzi 2013). We found that the tested commensals did not bind MBL proteins (Figures S3E and S3F), suggesting that C3 deposition on intestinal bacteria is mediated by the alternative pathway. Recombinant IL-22 Improves the Survival of C. difficileInfected Mice by Enhancing Systemic Clearance of Intestinal Pathobionts Il22/ mice showed defective clearance of translocated pathobionts in peripheral organs after C. difficile infection (Figure 4A). We therefore determined whether systemic administration of recombinant IL-22 protects Il22/ mice from C. difficile-infectioninduced mortality. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of IL-22 rescuedmice frommortality afterC. difficile infection (Figure 5A), which was associated with reduced numbers of translocated bacteria in the liver and lung (Figure 5B). To further investigate the ability of IL-22 to confer systemic protection against pathobionts, we used NI1077, one of the dominant pathobionts that translocate into extraintestinal organs after C. difficile infection. We found that i.v. administration of pathobiont NI1077 induced IL-1b production, but no or minimal induction of IL-22 in the liver, lung, or cecum (Figures S4A–S4E).

Notably, administration of recombinant IL-22 improved the survival of NI1077-infected Pycard/ mice, which was associated with reduced numbers of NI1077 in the blood (Figures 5C and 5D). These results suggest that IL-22 protects the host by inducing systemic immune responses that promote the clearance of harmful pathobionts and thus leads to improved host survival after C. difficile infection. IL-22 Enhances Elimination of Commensal Bacteria during C. difficile Infection by Inducing C3 Expression and Deposition To determine the mechanisms by which IL-22 enhances the host protective response against translocated pathobionts after C. difficile infection, we first tested the expression of b-defensins DEFB4 and DEFB14, whose human homologs are induced by IL22 stimulation in keratinocytes (Wolk et al., 2004). We found increased Defb4 mRNA expression in the cecum after C. difficile infection but undetectable Defb14 mRNA expressionImmunity 41, 620–632in WT and Il22/ mice (Figure S5A). Neutrophils isolated from Il22/ andWTmice showed similar bactericidal activity (Figure S5B), indicating that IL-22 does not affect the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. To further study the immune responses elicited by IL-22, we reviewed the Gene Expression Omnibus data set (accession numbers GDS3226 and GSE44091) of gene expression in IL-22treated or TcdAand TcdB-treated murine intestines (Zheng et al., 2008; D’Auriaet al., 2013). In addition to showing increased expression of genes known to be induced by IL-22, such as those encoding S100 proteins and acute phase proteins (Liang et al., 2010; Sonnenberg et al., 2012), analysis of the data sets revealed increased expression of C3 in IL-22-treated and TcdAand TcdB-treated mice (Figures S5C and S4D). Therefore, we determined whether IL-22 regulates the induction of C3 expression in response to C. difficile infection. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the mRNA expression of C3, but not Cfd (complement factor D, a component of the alternative complement pathway), was increased in the liver and intestine 2 days after C. difficile infection (Figures 6A and 6B). We also confirmed the induction of other known IL-22-regulated genes after C. difficile infection, including those encoding S100 proteins and acute phase proteins (Figures S5E–S5H). Notably, the induction of C3 was significantly lower in Il22/ mice than in control WT mice (Figures 6A and 6B). We also found that the induction of C3 was independent of RAG1 (Figure S5I). Furthermore, injection of recombinant IL-22 induced C3mRNA expression in WT mice (Figure 6C) and increased the expression of C3 in the liver of Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection (Figure 6A)., October 16, 2014 ª2014 Elsevier Inc. 627 Figure 6.

Immunity IL-22-Mediated Systemic Elimination of PathobiontsWe additionally performed immunoblotting analysis to verify that C3 amounts in serum were also increased in C. difficile-infected WT and Il22/ mice (Figure S5J). Comparison of C3 expression in organs revealed the liver as the potential major source of increasedC3 after IL-22 treatment (Figure S5K). Indeed, stimulation of the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 with IL-22 increased C3 expression, which was inhibited by incubation with the STAT3-specific inhibitor WP1066 (Figure S5L). In addition, the amounts of C3 deposition on pathobionts were higher when the bacteria were incubated with sera from infected WT mice than when they were incubated with sera from uninfected WT mice (Figure 6D, compare lanes 1 and 2; 4 and 5; and 7 and 8). Moreover, C3 deposition by pathobionts was lower when the bacteria were incubated with sera from infected Il22/ mice than when they were incubated with sera from infected WT mice (Figure 6D, compare lanes 2 and 3; 5 and 6; and 8 and 9). Likewise, the bactericidal activity of neutrophils was enhanced by incubation with sera from C. difficile-infected WT mice, but not from Il22/ mice (Figure 6E). Furthermore, the sera from mice treated with IL-22 enhanced both C3 deposition on pathobionts (Figure 6F) and the bactericidal activity of neutrophils (Figure 6G). These results indicate that IL-22 promotesC3 expression and deposition on bacteria and thereby enhances the ability of neutrophils to kill pathobionts. To determine the role of C3 in IL-22-mediated protective responses, we determined the effect of C3 depletion by cobra venom factor (CVF) on the ability of serum to augment pathobiont killing by neutrophils. Immunoblotting analysis showed that C3 amounts in the serum were increased after IL-22 treatment (Figures S5M and S5N). Injection of CVF depleted C3 in naive and infected mice after treatment with IL-22 (Figure S5N). Notably, C3 depletion by CVF was confirmed by the disappearance of the C3 peak in the chromatographic profile and of the C3 a chain in Coomassie blue staining (Figures S5M and S5N, lower panel), indicating that C3 is highly abundant in the serum, consistent with the published serum-protein database (Nanjappa et al., 2014). Because IL-22 can potentially induce multiple serum proteins, we separated serum proteins by UnoQ column chromatography and determined whether the C3-containing fraction would specifically augment pathobiont killing by neutrophils. Immunoblotting analysis showed that C3 was separated from most of other serum proteins and was detected in fraction 3 (Figures S5M and S5N). The serum from IL-22-treated mice showed increased protein amounts in fraction 3 as well as in other fractions, whereas CVF-treated mice with and without IL-22 coinjection showed reduced protein amounts only in fraction 3 (Figure S5M), consistent with the finding by Coomassie blue staining. Using UnoQ column fractionation, we found that the presence of C3 (fraction 3) correlated with increased pathobiont killing activity by neutrophils, which was enhanced by IL-22 and blocked by C3 depletion with CVF (Figure S5O). Therefore, C3,(E) Neutrophils were incubated with the indicated strains in mouse sera from Il22 were counted by plating on BHI. Cdiff, C. difficile.

To determine whether C3 is important for host mortality and bacterial elimination after C. difficile infection and i.v. injection of the pathobiont NI1077, we treated mice with CVF to deplete C3 before C. difficile infection or pathobiont i.v. administration. We found that CVF-treated mice were more susceptible to both C. difficile infection (Figure S5P) and i.v. administration of the pathobiont (Figure S5R). Importantly, IL-22 injection failed to rescue CVF-treated mice from mortality induced by i.v. administration of the pathobiont (Figure S5R). Consistently, we found that bacterial load was higher in the liver and lung of C. difficile-infected mice that had been pretreated with CVF (Figure S5Q) and in the blood of pathobiont-infected mice than in mice pretreated with CVF or mice without CVF treatment (Figure S5S). Collectively, these results suggest that C3 plays an important role in IL-22-mediated pathobiont elimination during C. difficile infection and protects the host from pathobiontinduced lethality. DISCUSSION In this study, we have demonstrated a protective role for IL-22 in host defense against C. difficile infection. Il22/ mice displayed higher mortality than did WT mice after C. difficile infection despite a comparable degree of intestinal damage and pathogen burden. In Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection, we found increased translocation of enterobacterial pathobionts to extraintestinal organs, including the liver, which was associated with increased degree of liver injury. These pathobionts exhibited high pathogenicity when present in the blood, which was associated with their resistance to complement-mediated phagocytosis and killing by phagocytes. Importantly, IL-22 was required for induction of C3 after C. difficile infection, and IL-22 administration protected the mice from pathobiont accumulation in extraintestinal organs and pathobiont-associated mortality. Therefore, our study highlights an important role for IL-22 in limiting pathobiont-induced systemic disease and identifies a mechanism by which pathobionts can evade host immunity. IL-22 has been shown to be critical for host defense against other pathogens (Aujla et al., 2008; Basu et al., 2012; SatohTakayama et al., 2008; Schulz et al., 2008). In addition, IL-22 has been implicated in the clearance of Alcaligenes species in lymphoid tissues (Sonnenberg et al., 2012) and affects the composition of the microbiota in mice infected with S. enterica Typhimurium (Behnsen et al., 2014). However, we found no significant differences between Il22/ mice and WT mice in the microbiota composition before or after C. difficile infection, suggesting that IL-22 does not regulate the composition of microbiota in all infection models. In other infection models, IL-22 protects the host against pathogens via the induction of/ and WT mice infected or uninfected with C. difficile. The surviving bacteria use) by i.p. injection.

Deficiency in IL-22 also results in increased translocation of intestinal bacteria into the liver after C. rodentium infection. Although IL-22 protects the host by regulating the elimination of C. rodentium (Basu et al., 2012), IL-22 did not affect the number of C. difficile in the intestine. This suggests that IL-22 can also promote host survival through mechanisms distinct from pathogen elimination. Our studies highlight the importance of systemic protection against pathobionts after they are translocated into peripheral organs as a result of intestinal epithelial barrier defects induced by C. difficile infection. In the C. difficile infection model, IL-22 plays a critical role in complement-mediated elimination of pathobionts that have disseminated systemically, at least in part, by upregulating C3 expression. Therefore, IL-22 protects the host not only by promoting intestinal barrier function but also by promoting protective systemic immune responses. In theC. difficile infection model, inflammasome-mediated IL-1b production is also critical for both local (intestinal) and systemic immune responses by facilitating neutrophil recruitment and promoting elimination of commensals after C. difficile infection (Hasegawa et al. 2011; Hasegawa et al. 2012). IL-1b is also important for IL-22 production by innate lymphoid cells (Sutton et al., 2009). It is possible that the host has additional protective mechanisms against infection to link local to systemic immune responses against pathogens and pathobionts. Moreover, C. difficile infection induces several proteins, including S100 proteins and acute phase proteins, in an IL22-dependent manner. S100 proteins are known to regulate C3 expression (Schonthaler et al., 2013). Therefore, S100might also contribute to increased C3 expression during C. difficile infection. C3 activation by bacteria results in production of C3a and the downstream factor C5a (Noris and Remuzzi 2013). C3a and C5a are known to be involved in the recruitment of IL1b-producing inflammatory cells, inflammasome activation, and IL-22 induction (Liu et al., 2011; Laudisi et al., 2013; Noris and Remuzzi 2013). Therefore, innate responses mediated by complement fragments IL-1b and IL-22 might exert a positivefeedback loop as a part of the complex host defensemechanism that confers both intestinal and systemic protection against pathobiont-induced morbidity. Complement fragments and IL22 are also known to be involved in liver repair (Strey et al., 2003; Radaeva et al., 2004). Therefore, signaling mediated by complements IL-1b and IL-22 might also play an important role during the recovery phase after C. difficile infection. Fully understanding the mechanisms by which the host coordinates local and systemic immunity will require additional studies. After C. difficile infection, a subset of patients with pseudomembranous colitis develop sepsis and multiple organ failure, which are associated with high mortality (Eaton and Mazuski, 2013; Sunenshine andMcDonald, 2006). The elimination of commensals by antibiotics improves host survival after C. difficile infection in the mouse model, suggesting a potential therapeutic application. C. difficile possesses toxins that disrupt epithelial barrier function (Kuehne et al., 2010), which subsequently leads to translocation of commensals and immunostimulatory molecules through the damaged intestinal epithelium. Neutrophils that are recruited into the damaged intestine can eliminate630 Immunity 41, 620–632, October 16, 2014 ª2014 Elsevier Inc.many of the translocated commensals after C. difficile infection (Hasegawa et al., 2011; Hasegawa et al., 2012). However, we have shown here that certain pathobionts are resistant to host defense responses, including phagocytosis, and eventually translocate into peripheral organs to cause organ damage. Therefore, host mechanisms to boost systemic protection against translocated pathobionts, such as those mediated through IL-22, are important for survival against C. difficile infection and could be exploited in the treatment against C. difficile infection. Our study has shown that g-enterobacterial commensals as one of the dominant pathobionts responsible for complications of C. difficile infection in the mouse model. Importantly, individual strains within the same g-enterobacterial species display differential sensitivity to complement-mediated phagocytosis and cause varying degrees of lethality to the host. One of the complement-resistance mechanisms exhibited by bacteria is capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) on the bacterial surface, which can shield bacteria from recognition by complement factors (Rautemaa and Meri, 1999). In addition, the outer structures of lipopoly(oligo)saccharides (LPSs or LOSs) are crucial for protecting bacteria against host immune responses, including complement activity (Roberts, 1996). The complement-resistant structural determinants of CPSs and LPSs are highly diverse among enterobacteria (Rautemaa and Meri, 1999). Therefore, the differential sensitivity of individual strains within the same bacterial species to complement might be ultimately dependent on their surface structures. Our study highlights the importance of complement resistance in the pathogenesis of commensalmediated intestinal disease. Therefore, understanding themechanisms by which pathobionts acquire complement resistance will be critical for treating systemic complications caused by gut commensal bacteria. The presence of commensals is important to suppress C. difficile expansion in the intestine, and elimination of competitive commensals by antibiotics results in overgrowth of C. difficile and C. difficile-infection-related disease (Carroll and Bartlett, 2011). Currently, elimination of C. difficile with vancomycin and/or metronidazole is the firstline treatment for C. difficile-infected patients (Rupnik et al., 2009). However, some patients suffer relapsing disease that is refractory to standard antibiotic treatment. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from healthy donors has been shown to be effective for the prevention of disease recurrence (Koenigsknecht and Young, 2013; Lo Vecchio and Cohen, 2014). Because individual strains within the same species possess differential resistance against host elimination and can give rise to varying degrees of disease severity, it will be important to assess in detail the composition of the donor microbiota in fecal transplants to avoid transplanting potential pathobionts to patients already sickened by infection and dysbiosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Bacterial Strains C. difficile VPI10463 and E. coli K-12 were cultured as previously described (Hasegawa et al., 2012). Enterobacter hormaechei NI1077, NI1109, and NI796; Klebsiella pneumoniae NI1078, NI1188, and NI1185; E. coli NI1076; E. faecalis NI1079; and L. murinus NI1118 were isolated from the intestine of C. difficile-infected or uninfected mice and cultured at 37C in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (BD) under an aerobic environment, and their 16S rRNA gene phylotypes were determined as described in Hasegawa et al. (2012). Immunity IL-22-Mediated Systemic Elimination of PathobiontsMice WT, C3/, and Rag1/ C57BL/6 (B6) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Il22/mice in B6 backgroundwere a gift fromDr.Wenjun Ouyang (Genentech). All mice were housed, bred, and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions as described in Hasegawa et al. (2012). Mice in different cages or derived fromdifferent sourceswere cohoused for 2weeks for normalization of the microbiota composition before experiments. The mouse studies were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals. C. difficile Infection and Analyses Eight-week-old mice were infected with 108 colony-forming units (cfu) of C. difficile VPI10463 after antibiotic treatment as described in Hasegawa et al. (2012). Postinfection analyses were performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Analysis of Microbiota Composition Bacterial DNAs were extracted from mouse intestines as described in Hasegawa et al. (2012). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (252 bp) was sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq sequencer, and z22,000 reads were analyzed byMothur (Schloss et al., 2009; Kozich et al., 2013). OTUs were classified into taxonomic phylotypes at >97% identity with the use of Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009). Preparation of Intestinal Immune Cells and Flow Cytometric Analysis Intestinal lamina propria cells were prepared from mice 2 days postinfection, and immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis were performed as previously described in Hasegawa et al. (2012). In brief, isolated lamina propria cells were stained with fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled CD11b monoclonal antibody (mAb; M1/70), allophycocyanin-labeled mAb F4/80 (BM8), and phycoerythrin-labeled Ly-6G mAb (1A8). Isotype-matched antibodies (BD) were used as controls. Dead cells were excluded with 7-AAD staining. Neutrophils were defined as CD11b+Ly-6G+ cells, and macrophages were defined as CD11b+F4/80+ cells. Assay of Systemic Infection Mice were injected with 2 3 108 cfu of isolated commensals intravenously. Bacterial number in the blood on day 3 was determined by serial plating of diluted blood, and colonies were counted on BHI plates after 24 hr incubation under aerobic conditions. Assay of Phagocytosis and Bacterial Killing Bone-marrow-derived macrophages were cultured with isolated bacteria (multiplicity of infection [moi] 1:1) for 20 min with or without 5% fresh mouse serum and then treated with 50 mg/ml gentamycin for 1 hr after five washes with PBS. The cells were lysed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and plated on BHI. Under these conditions, 91% ± 3% of bacteria survived in macrophages for 2 hr, and 97.2% ± 0.7% of bacteria were killed within 24 hr. For the assay of bacterial killing, mouse peritoneal neutrophils were collected from the i.p. cavity 4 hr after i.p. injection of thioglycollate medium. Next, 5 3 105 neutrophils were incubated with 5 3 103 bacteria with 2.5% (v/v) fresh mouse serum for 2 hr. Bacterial survival was assessed by plating on BHI. Immunoblotting for C3 Deposition A total of 53 108 bacteria were incubated in 50% (v/v) mouse serum for 30min at 37C. Unbound C3 was removed from bacterial pellets by washing with icecold PBS. Samples and control 1/200 total reaction mixtures were boiled in Laemmli’s buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (1 3 108 bacteria per lane). For C3 deposition, C3 was examined by immunoblotting using antimouse C3d antibody (R&D). For the binding assay of MBL proteins, MBLs were examined by immunoblotting using anti-mouse MBL1 and MBL2 antibodies (gifts from Steffen Thiel, Aarhus University in Denmark). For equal loading, aliquots from each sample were plated, and equal amounts of colony-forming units were lysed.Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software version 6.0 (GraphPad Software). Differences between two groupswere evaluated with an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. False discovery rate q values were calculated by Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) for comparison of OTU abundances. For multiple group comparisons, statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA and then the Dunnett’s or Sidak’s test as a post hoc test. The survival rate of infected mice was analyzed with the log-rank test. Differences at p < 0.05 were considered significant.
