Gies Keywords: Apoptosis Cytokines IL-17A Fluorosis Leydig cells Testisa b s t r a c t The reproductive toxicity of fluoride (F) has been verified by various epidemiological and experimental studies. Our previous work suggested that the interleukin 17A (IL-17A) is involved in the testicular damage induced by excessive F exposure. In this study, we further investigated the role of IL-17A in Finduced testicular injury. Wild type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL-17A-/-) mice were exposed to 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/L sodium fluoride (NaF) for 90 days. We found that exposure to excessive F levels caused testicular damage, decreased semen quality, negatively affected testicular morphology, and increased the inflammatory response. Specifically, excessive F intake increased the expression levels of IL-17A in the testis and increased the protein levels of Act1, NF-kB, IL-17R, C/EBP-a, and TRAF6 in the IL-17A signaling pathway. The increase in IL-17A expression corresponded to increases expression of IL-17R, IL-6, IL-23, IL1b, TGF-b and TNF-a as assessed by RT-PCR and ELISA assays. Remarkably, IL-17A knockout in mice ameliorated the effects of F on testicular damage, semen quality, testicular morphology, and the immune response. Additionally, we found the in vitro exposure of Leydig cells to NaF and recombinant IL-17A led to abnormal apoptosis and a decrease in testosterone secretion. Our findings prove that IL-17A plays a key role in the exacerbation of testicular injuries in F-exposed mice, and that IL-17A deficiency can alleviate F-induced injury by inhibiting the immune response and apoptosis in the testis. These data suggest that targeting IL-17A may be a useful therapeutic strategy for treating F-mediated toxicity in the testis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Li et al. / Chemosphere 263 (2021) 12817821. Introduction Fluoride (F) is a highly ubiquitous chemical found in the environment to which organisms and human beings are constantly exposed on a daily basis (Everett, 2011). Numerous studies have shown that excessive F exposure can damage human health, including skeletal, digestive, immune, and reproductive systems, and especially the testicular tissue (Dhar and Bhatnagar, 2009; Su et al., 2017). It has been demonstrated that excessive F ingestion had an adverse impact on the hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular axis structure, testicular histology, and quality of semen (Wei et al., 2018). Research has revealed that excessive F intake can amplify apoptosis, autophagy, and even death of germ cells (Zhang et al., 2017). Intriguingly, using the sequenced RNA transcripts from the testicles of healthy and F-exposed male mice in our previous study, and identified four pathways related to interleukin 17A (IL17A) signaling that were upregulated in the testes of F-exposed male mice (Huo et al., 2016). This indicates that IL-17A may be the pivotal regulator in the process of excessive F-induced testicular damage in mice. In our previous studies, we found that F-induced testicular toxicity in mice was associated with inflammatory responses by destroying the blood-testes-barrier (BTB) (He et al., 2018). Notably, inflammation of the testes due to excessive F exposure is associated with autoimmune orchitis, wherein IL-17A operates as a key cytokine in the inflammatory process (Wu et al., 2019). In testis, excessive IL-17A production can recruit immune cells to the testicular interstitial tissue thus inducing local infiltration of the inflammatory cells and destroying the BTB (Duan et al., 2011). The levels of IL-17A in the testes of subfertile and infertile patients with functional and obstructive sperm deficiency are significantly higher as compared to those in patients with normal fertility (Perez et al., 2014). However, the function and mechanism of IL-17A increase during F-induced testicular damage are not clear. Based on these previous studies, we evaluated the causative role of IL-17A in F-induced testicular damage in a mouse model. In this study, a model of F damage (referred to as fluorosis) was established in wild type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL-17A-/-) mice to explore the role of IL-17A in F-induced testicular damage in mice and on semen quality, testicular morphology, and serum testosterone levels. Furthermore, we examined the expression levels of genes and proteins involved in the IL-17A signaling pathway and related cytokines to explore the role of Il-17A signaling in fluorosis. In addition, we conducted in vitro experiments to explore the target cells of F-induced IL-17A injury in the testis and forms the basis for scientific diagnosis and possible target drug design. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Establishment of the animal model To verify the effect of excessive F exposure on the expression of IL-17A in mouse testes, 8-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into four groups (13 mice/group). They had access to normal diet and distilled water, containing different concentrations of sodium fluoride (NaF) (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L) for 90 days (d). To explore the effects of F on the testes of IL-17A-deficient mice, 8-week-old male mice were divided into three groups (13 mice/group), as follows: one control group (C group), WT mice receiving normal diet and distilled water; two fluorosis groups (WT NaF and IL-17A-/NaF groups), WT C57BL/6J and IL-17A-/(C57BL/6J background) mice receiving normal diet and distilled water containing 50 mg/L NaF for 90 d. Mice were weighed every week. After 90 d, the general status of all mice was observed, and they were euthanized with an intraperitonealinjection of 1% sodium pentobarbital. The semen quality was immediately assessed after examining the testes and extracting the semen. Then, it was quickly stored in liquid nitrogen for the isolation of the total RNA and protein. 2.2. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR The total RNA was isolated from the testes using the Trizol reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, it was reverse-transcribed using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, China). Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using the QuantStudio™ 6 and 7 Flex (Applied Biosystems™, USA). The primers of the analyzed genes are shown in Table 1 of Supplementary Material. QRT-PCR was performed in 10 mL of reaction mixture based on a previously described protocol and the expression levels of the target genes were performed by the 2DDCt method (Zhao et al., 2017). 2.3. Collection of interstitial fluid The interstitial fluid was collected via an incision in the testis capsule, and the drained fluid was collected and kept at 4 C in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 mg/mL aprotinin). After 16 h, the interstitial fluid was stored at70 C for analysis of IL-17A protein level. 2.4. Quantification of F levels in the femur of mice After NaF exposure, the femurs were removed, and the F content in each sample was determined using a F ion selective electrode (Wei et al., 2016). Briefly, femurs were dry-ashed in a muffle furnace for 5 h at 550 C. Bone cinder (20 mg) was placed in a small polyethylene bottle containing 5 mL of 0.5 M HCl. This solutionwas then mixed with total ionic strength adjustment buffer I (TISAB I), Y. Li et al. / Chemosphere 263 (2021) 128178 3and the final solution was used to measure F concentration. 2.5. Detection of sperm count and deformity rate Aliquots of sperm suspensions were prepared for determination of the sperm quality, as previously described (Li et al., 2017). Briefly, 10 mL of sperm suspension was placed in an erythrocyte counting plate (Neubauer chamber), and a small drop of semen was applied on the slide to determine the rate of sperm deformity (at least 200 sperms/sample were included). Microscopically, most of the spermatozoa were normal; however, some spermatozoa showed head deformity (e.g., head, thin, slender, round, obscure outline, wrinkle, defect, double head), neck deformity (e.g., neck enlargement, slenderness, flexion, incompleteness, bisomy), middle tail deformity (e.g., enlargement, slenderness, flexion, incompleteness, bisomy), or tail deformity. 2.6. Histopathological and ultrastructural analyses The testes were fixed in Bouin’s solution for 12 h and embedded in high-quality paraffin wax. To analyze the testis morphology, the samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and examined under a microscope with 400  magnification (B51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Additionally, six testicular tissue samples were imaged using the H-7500 transmission electron microscope (TEM), as previously described (Zhao et al., 2017). 2.7. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay The protein levels of IL-17A, IL-17RA, IL-17RC, IL-6, IL-23, IL-1b, TGF-b, IFN-g, and TNF-a in the interstitial fluid, as well as the level of testosterone in the serum were determined using ELISA assay, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd. China). 2.8. Total protein extraction and western blotting The frozen testes were homogenized using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing PMSF. Then, the supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000  g for 10 min at 4 C, and the protein extract was collected. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded on polyacrylamide-modified gel. Then, they were transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane for 90 min at 60 V. The membranes were blocked using tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBS-T) with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at 25 C, and then incubated with anti-b-actin, anti-IL-17A, anti-IL-17R, anti-Act1, antieNFekB, anti-C/EBP-a, anti-TRAF6, anti-ARK1C3, anti-SHD, and antiCYP11A1 antibodies (Affinity Biosciences, China 1:200) overnight at 4 C. After threewashes, the NCmembranes were incubatedwith horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Affinity Biosciences, China 1:2000) diluted in TBS-T for 12 h at 4 C. After three washes with TBS-T, the target protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Affinity Biosciences, China). The optical density was calculated using the Alpha View software (Version: 3.2.2.0) of the FluorChem Q system (AlphaInnotech, CA, USA). 2.9. Immunohistochemistry To measure the apoptosis in the testes, we used the immunohistochemistry to analyze the protein levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9. The procedures followed a strictly standard protocol by following the immunohistochemistry kit. Finally, light microscopy with 400  (BX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was performed to observe the location of the target proteins (BOSTER BiologicalTechnology Co. Ltd. China). 2.10. Culture of TM3 Leydig cells and determination of testosteronerelated gene expression TM3 Leydig cells (6103 cells/well) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium and treated with 10 mg/L NaF and/or 5 ng/mL IL-17A for 24 h. The cells were collected to extract the mRNA, and the expression of several testosterone-related genes (iNOS, 3b-HSD, 17b-HSD, CYP11A, and STAR) was analyzed. 2.11. Apoptosis assay TM3 Leydig cells were treated with 10 mg/L NaF and/or 5 ng/mL IL-17A for 24 h. The proportion of apoptotic cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur II flow cytometer) using the FITC Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). Data were analyzed using CellQuest software. 2.12. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as the means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Differences among the treatment groups were analyzed using oneway analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test. A pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3. Results 3.1. Interleukin 17A is induced in the testes of mice exposed to different NaF concentrations To characterize which interleukins participate in testicular injury as a result of the production of IL-17A, we exposed WT mice to 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg/L NaF and then measured the mRNA expression levels of cytokines associated with IL-17A function and secretion in the testes. As shown in Fig. 1A, the mRNA expression levels of IL-17A, IL-17R, IL-6, TNF-a, TGF-b, IL-23, and IL-1b in the testes of mice treated with 50 mg/L NaF, were higher than those in mice treated with 0 mg/L NaF (P < 0.05), but no significant changes were observed in the mRNA expression levels of IFN-g. In the 100 mg/L NaF group, the expression levels of IL-17A, TNF-a, IL-23, and IL-1b were significantly increased (P < 0.05), while the rest of the cytokines exhibited no obvious changes. We also measured the IL-17A expression levels in testicular interstitial fluid and observed that these were increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the groups treated with 25mg/L and 50mg/L NaF but not in those treatedwith 100 mg/L NaF, as compared to those in the control group (Fig. 1B). These data imply that excessive F exposure does increase the expression of IL-17A in testis, and that IL-6, IL-23, IL-1b, TGF-b, and TNF-a participate in the production of IL-17A. 3.2. Successful establishment of a fluorosis model in WT and IL17A-/deficient mice To verify the successful establishment of the animal model for fluorosis, we measured the F content in the bones of experimental mice. Compared to the control group, the bone F contents in WT and IL-17A-/mice exposed to 50 mg/L NaF for 90 d were both significantly increased (P < 0.001). In contrast, there was a significant decrease in body weight gain in the WT NaF-treated group (P < 0.01) but not in the in IL-17A-deficient NaF treated group. These results indicate that our model of fluorosis was successfully Fig. 1.

Interleukin 17A mediates the damage to semen quality caused by excessive F exposure To explore the role of IL-17A in the testes after F injury, we examined changes in semen quality in mice, including sperm count and deformity rates. Compared to controls, in theWTgroup treated with 50 mg/L NaF the sperm count showed a trend towards a decrease (P < 0.01), whereas the deformity rate showed a trend towards an increase (P < 0.01). Notably, no significant changes in semen quality were observed in the IL-17A-/group treated with 50 mg/L NaF (Fig. 3).3.4. Interleukin 17A mediates the effect of excessive F exposure on testicular histomorphology and ultrastructure in mice We assessed alterations in the histomorphology and ultrastructure of testes using H&E staining as well by TEM, respectively. In the control group, we observed a normal testicular morphology with neatly arranged spermatogenic tubules and cells, and abundant spermatozoa in the middle of the seminiferous tubule. In the WT NaF-treated group, there was a decrease in the number of spermatogenic cells and spermatozoa, and an increase in thedistance between the seminiferous tubules. In addition, the seminiferous tubules were reduced in terms of their diameter and thickness. Interestingly, the morphology of testes in the IL-17A-/NaF-treated (50 mg/L) group was almost similar to that in the control (no significant changes) (Fig. 4A). By examining the ultrastructure of mouse testes (Fig. 4B) we observed some severe pathological alterations in the Leydig cells in the testicular interstitium of mice. In the control and IL-17A-/NaF-treated groups, we found rich lipid droplets inside and on the villi on the edge of Leydig cells. However, in the WT NaF-treated group, the lipid droplets in Leydig cells were increased both in size and number, indicating that the secretion of testosterone was reduced. Also, the marginal villi disappeared with a decrease in the surface area of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the ultrastructure of mice testes in IL-17A-/knockout mice exposed to 50 mg/L NaF is similar to that in normal mice, with no apparent pathological alterations.3.5. IL-17A mediates the effect of excessive F exposure on mouse serum testosterone levels We further evaluated serum testosterone levels using an ELISA as well as the levels of testosterone-secretion-related proteins by western blotting. Exposure to 50 mg/L NaF for 90 d resulted in a Fig. 2. Successful establishment of fluorosis animal model. (A)F content in femur (n ¼ 13. Three times repetition).

Li et al. / Chemosphere 263 (2021) 128178 5remarkable decrease in serum testosterone levels in the WT group (P < 0.05), but these remained normal in the IL-17A-/group (Fig. 5A). We also measured the expression of testosteronesecretion-related proteins in mice testes from each group. In contrast to the control group, the protein levels of AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 were dramatically reduced in the WT NaF-treated group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), but the protein levels of SHD remained unaltered (Fig. 5B). However, in the IL-17A-/-mice that received the same dose of NaF for the same duration, the expression levels of these genes were not statistically different from those in the control group. Thus, these results suggest that knocking out IL-17A in mice can alleviate the testicular damage caused by F. 3.6. F exposure increases the expression levels of downstream proteins in the IL-17A signaling pathway in the testes To understand how IL-17A works during F-induced testicular damage, we examined the expression levels of various downstream proteins potentially involved in the IL-17A signaling pathway. Compared to the control group, the expression levels of IL-17A and Act1 (P < 0.001), NF-kB (P < 0.01), IL-17R, C/EBP-a, and TRAF6 (P < 0.05) were all increased significantly in the WT NaF-treated group (Fig. 6). However, these proteins did not show a visible change in expression levels in the IL-17A-/NaF-treated group. These results suggest that F stimulates the testes to produce IL-17A, thereby inducing testicular damage by activating downstreamproteins involved in the IL-17A signaling pathway. 3.7. The effect of IL-17A deficiency in the testes on the expression of cytokine related to IL-17A secretion and function in a mouse model of fluorosis To investigate the effect of IL-17A knockout on the immune response in the testis of mice exposed to excess F levels, we assessed the expression levels of cytokines related to IL-17A secretion and function. We found that in the testis of WT Ftreatedmice, with the exception of IFN-g, the levels of IL-17RC, IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-b were all increased significantly (P < 0.01) and IL1b and TNF-a levels were also clearly increased (P < 0.05), compared to those in the control (Fig. 7). The expression levels cytokines, as assessed by ELISA, in the testis of WT F-treated mice were consistent with the mRNA levels detected using PCR. Importantly, in the absence of IL-17A, the expression levels of IFN-g were found to be significantly higher than in control mice (P < 0.05), whereas the levels of the rest of the cytokines were not statistically significantly different. 3.8. Interleukin 17A amplifies the in vivo NaF-induced apoptosis of testicular interstitial cells To explore the mechanism of IL-17A-induced testicular damage in F-treated mice, we examined apoptosis in testicular cells using Fig. 4. IL-17A mediates the change of excessive fluoride to histomorphological and ultrastructural in testis. (A) Histological images of the testis of the wild-type and IL-17A-/mice stained with HE staining.

Exposure to NaF (50 mg/L) for 90 d increased the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the interstitial tissue of WT mice testes (P < 0.01). However, there was no significant increase in the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the testes of F-treated IL-17A-/mice compared with the control group. These results indicate that F-induced IL-17A production may amplify apoptosis in testicular interstitial tissue.3.9. Interleukin 17A promotes Leydig cell apoptosis and reduces testosterone secretion in vitro We next sought to investigate the effect of IL-17A in Leydig cells in mice testes. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining using flow cytometry to determine the effect of NaF and/or IL-17A in Leydig cells. Our results (Fig. 9A) show that 10 mg/L NaF and/or 5 ng/mL IL-17A could promote Leydig cell apoptosis, suggesting that the combination of IL-17A and F results in a significant increase in the level of apoptosis in Leydig cells. We also analyzed the in vitro expression levels of testosteronesecretion-related genes, such as INOS, 3b-SHD, 17b-SHD, CYP11A, and STAR, in Leydig cells using RT-PCR. The results showed thatboth F and IL-17A reduced the expression levels of these genes and the secretion of testosterone, which was consistent with the results from our in vivo experiments, suggesting that IL-17Amainly targets the Leydig cells in the testes after F damage (Fig. 9B).4. Discussion Fluorosis is a disease with worldwide prevalence and particularly endemic to Chinawhere it causes serious harm (Pramanik and Saha, 2017). In 2015, a review reported that F ion concentrations in the groundwater can reach up to 48 mg/L (Lussi et al., 2019). This means that drinking water is the main source of excess F ions, causing fluorosis in both humans and animals. Although the exact link between fluorosis and infertility was established as early as 1925, the mechanisms linking them have been poorly understood to date. Hence, it is important to evaluate the mechanisms of reproductive toxicity caused by F using an effective and reliable animalmodel. Here, first we exposedWT C57BL/6J mice to different concentrations of NaF, (25, 50, and 100mg/L) for 90 d. We observed that IL-17A was highly expressed in the testes of mice exposed to 50mg/L NaF and that IL-6, IL-23, IL-1b, TGF-b, and TNF-a are closely Fig. 5.

We also showed that the expression of IL17A increased in the testicular interstitium of the fluorosis mouse model. This is consistent with a report by Perez et al. which suggested that IL-17A is mainly expressed in the testicular interstitium of azoospermic patients (Perez et al., 2014). However, themechanisms behind F-induced testicular damage and IL-17A production have not been demonstrated previously. Hence, we selected the IL-17A gene knockout fluorosis mouse model to gain more insights into fluorosis and its effects. Although low doses of F are beneficial for mammalian teeth and bones, long-term exposure can cause dental fluorosis and may Fig. 7.

Li et al. / Chemosphere 263 (2021) 1281788interfere with bone formation (O’Mullane et al., 2016). Therefore, the F content in the skeleton is an important index to assess the successful establishment of the fluorosis model. In this study, when mice (either WTor IL-17A-/-) were exposed to 50 mg/L NaF for 90 d, the F content significantly increased in the mouse femurs, indicating that the animal model of fluorosis had been successfully established. Earlier studies have shown the height and weight of children in F-contaminated areas were significantly lower than in areas with normal F levels (Wiegand et al., 2007). Recent animal model-based studies have reported that rats or mice exposed to excess F levels experience a significant reduction in weight as well as the liver organ weight coefficient (Boiocchi et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2018). This corroborates our results, which show that the weight gain in mice exposed to 50 mg/L NaF for 90 d was significantly lower compared to the control group, indicating that excessive F exposure causes an adverse effect on the growth of mice. It should be noted that F did not significantly affect weight gain in IL-17A-deficient mice; possibly the absence of IL-17A antagonizes the damage caused by F in other tissues. Numerous studies have shown that excessive F consumption can have adverse effects on the semen quality and damage the normal structure of testis (Dong et al., 2016; Han et al., 2015). In our study, the use of animal fluorosis models of different genotypes revealed that excessive NaF intake in WT mice could induce sperm count reduction and increase the rate of abnormal spermatozoa. In addition, it was found that the distance between seminiferous tubules increased and the number of cells in the spermatozoa and stroma decreased in F-treated mice testes (Ma et al., 2019). However, these abnormal changes in semen quality and structure were not observed in IL-17A-deficient mice treated with 50 mg/L of NaF for 90 d. We used TEM to identify the cells in testes targeted by F, and our results showed that the excessive intake of F damaged the normal structure of the Leydig cells, which may decrease their ability to secrete testosterone. These results are not only consistent with those from previous studies but also prove that functional alterations of IL-17A play a key role in F-induced testicular damage. Interleukin 17A, mainly produced by Th17 cells, is aninflammatory cytokine with various functions, such as eliminating pathogenic microorganisms and inducing autoimmune inflammation (Babaie et al., 2018; Iwakura et al., 2008). It can also recruit Act1 and TRAF6 by binding to IL-17RA or IL-17RC heterodimer receptor complexes during inflammation (Herjan et al., 2018). Selfubiquitinated TRAF6 binds to TAK1 complexes and activates IKK complexes, leading to the activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways (Isailovic et al., 2015). Also, Act1 participates in the activation of C/ EBP (Gravallese and Schett, 2018). Activation of the NF-kB, MAPK, and C/EBP pathways results in the upregulation of the expression of chemokines and cytokines, both of which induce immune cell recruitment, inflammatory responses, and tissue damage (Wu et al., 2015). Our findings indicate that the balanced expression of the signaling molecules downstream of IL-17R decides the cellular response. In the WT NaF-treated group in our study, we found that the protein levels of IL-17A, IL-17R, Act1, NF-kB, C/EBP-a, and TRAF6 were upregulated. This suggests that IL-17A and its signaling pathway might be involved in regulating the process of testicular damage in fluorosis. Although the mice in the IL-17A-/group were also exposed to NaF, the levels of these proteins remained largely unaltered compared to the normal mice. Hence, collectively, these data reveal that F-induced IL-17A production can damage the mice testes. Our findings corroborate the results of Wu et al., who showed that excessive F caused orchitis and damaged the normal function of mice testes (Wu et al., 2019). Testosterone, secreted by the Leydig cells, promotes and maintains spermatogenesis in the testes (Inoue et al., 2018). Many studies have confirmed that excessive F intake can reduce the level of testosterone in vivo (Duan et al., 2016; Orta Yilmaz et al., 2018). Based on our research in this experiment, we also detected the level of testosterone in IL-17A gene knockout fluorosis-affected mice, and were surprised to find that the testosterone levels in their serum were similar to those in normal mice. We also detected the proteins related to testosterone secretion in mouse testes. The AKR1C3, also called HSD3b1, is responsible for the final step in the biosynthesis of testosterone from androstenedione (Jackson et al., 2012). Unlike HSD11b1, CYP11A1 exists in all stages of the Leydig cells and encodes the Cytochrome P450 Family 11 Subfamily A Fig. 8.

Li et al. / Chemosphere 263 (2021) 128178 9Member 1A (Strauss, 2003). Both AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 are the key rate-limiting enzymes in the process of steroid hormone synthesis. It has been confirmed that excess F feeding can reduce the activity of AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 in the testes and inhibit the secretion of testosterone. Our study confirms previous findings that F can cause a decrease in AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 levels (Cao et al., 2016). However, these effects of F on AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 levels were not seen in the testes of IL-17A knockout mice, in which levels of AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 were similar to those in normal mice. To elucidate the effect of IL-17A deficiency on the testicular immune response in fluorosis-affected mice, we measured the levels of IL-17RA, IL-17RC, IL-6, IL-1b, IFN-g, TNFa, IL-23, and TGFb content in the testes using ELISA assays. Our findings showed that in F-induced testicular injury, IL-17A and its receptors were expressed mainly in the interstitial tissue of the testes. Interestingly, although IL-17RC expression significantly increased in the testis of the WT mice treated with F, the changes in IL-17RA levels were not significant; this warrants further investigations. Consistent with the previous reports, the testes levels of IL-6, IL-23, IL-1b,and TGF-b were increased in WT mice exposed to F (Huo et al., 2016). Other studies have also shown that the mRNA levels of TGF-b, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-21 are upregulated in the testes following F exposure, although no significant increases in TGF-b and IL-21 levels were found (Oyeyipo et al., 2010). More importantly, after knockout of IL-17A, the expression of IL-6 and IFN-g in the testis was higher compared with that in the control group. This result suggests that IL-17A deficiency can alleviate fluorosis by reducing the immune response in testis and damage from IL-17A to the testis may not be related to IL-6 and IFN-g. There are various types of immune cells in the testicular interstitium, including T cells, macrophages, and NK cells (Chakradhar, 2018). Nevertheless, it is unclear which immune cells secrete IL17A following F exposure. By combining the PCR and ELISA data on IL-17A secretion-related factors, we observed that the secretion levels of IL-6, IL-23, and IL-1b were increased in WT mice exposed to F. However, in the IL-17A knockout mice, with the exception of IL-6, the expression levels of these inflammatory factors did not increase after F treatment. These data suggest that the expression of Fig. 9. IL-17A and F promotes TM3 Leydig cell apoptosis and reduces testosterone secretion in vitro (A) Apoptotic rate of TM3 Leydig cells (n ¼ 10.

Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test. Error bars denote the mean ± s. e.m. *P < 0.05,**P < 0.01. Y. Li et al. / Chemosphere 263 (2021) 12817810IL-6, IL-23, and IL-1b depend on the increase in IL-17A during Finduced testicular injury. Previous studies have shown that an increase in IL-17A promotes the secretion of IL-6 in some inflammatory conditions and cancer (Ahmed et al., 2019). Also, gd T cells can produce IL-17A upon stimulation by IL-1b and IL-23 in the testes (Bonneville et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012). Characterized bythe expression of gd TCRs and the secretion of extensive array of pro-inflammatory cytokines, gd Tcells are themain source of IL-17A in various inflammatory diseases (Hong et al., 2018; Paul and Lal, 2016). Besides, in vitro studies have confirmed that the secretion of IL-17A increases when gd T cells bind to IL-23 (Choi et al., 2019). Therefore, we speculate that among the cytokines related to IL-17A, Y. Li et al. / Chemosphere 263 (2021) 128178 11the expression levels of IL-1b and IL-23, which can stimulate gd T cells to secrete IL-17A, would be sharply up-regulated as a result of F-induced testicular injury, indicating their role in IL-17A production. Testes have established an effective self-protection mechanism through their microenvironment, which is free from pathogens and inflammatory damage (Alfano et al., 2018). In our present study, the overexpression of IL-17A, IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-23 may have changed the internal environment of the testes, causing testicular damage. The changes in the testicular environment caused by the abnormal expression of cytokines can induce excessive apoptosis (Lysiak et al., 2001). We detected the expression of two key apoptosis proteins in the testes, caspase-3 and caspase-9, which play an irreplaceable role in apoptosis (Brentnall et al., 2013; Voss et al., 2018). Caspase-9 can be activated by self-cutting after being stimulated, followed by induction of the caspase cascade reaction to activate caspase-3 (Li et al., 2017). As a key death protease downstream of the apoptosis pathway inmammalian cells, caspase-3 can shear multiple polymerases and lead to apoptosis (Walsh et al., 2008). Numerous studies have confirmed that excessive F intake can lead to apoptosis of multiple tissues and cells (Adedara et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019). Furthermore, Yan et al. showed that F can induce the apoptosis of singular cells by accelerating the release of caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Yan et al., 2009). Here, we found that excessive NaF exposure can indeed boost the expression of caspase3 and caspase-9. However, in the absence of IL-17A, the expression of levels caspase-3 and caspase-9 was modulated in the testes. Notably, the F-induced apoptosis was not observed in the testicular interstitium of the IL-17A knockout mice. In addition, our immunohistochemical analysis indicated that cellular apoptosis in the testes mainly occurs in the interstitial tissue. We also demonstrated that NaF treatment in vivo can cause a significant decrease in testosterone secretion, however, this was not observed in IL-17A knockout mice. Therefore, we speculate that Leydig cells may be a target in the process of IL-17A-mediated F-induced testicular damage. Since our data suggested that F-induced testicular damage occurs mainly in Leydig cells we therefore chose Leydig cells as our target to further elucidate the role of F in inducing reproductive toxicity. Leydig cells, also referred to as interstitial cells, play a critical role in the testicular endocrine and immunologic systems (O’Hara et al., 2015). The Leydig cells have endocrine function as they secrete a high level of androgens (Chen et al., 2017). Previous studies have reported that excessive F exposure can lead to proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis of the Leydig cells (Sun et al., 2018). Here, we found that F and IL-17A can promote late apoptosis in Leydig cells and can significantly reduce the expression of genes involved in testosterone secretion. Therefore, we hypothesize that the increase in IL-17A after F exposure can cause Leydig cell apoptosis leading to a decrease in testosterone levels, which in turn, negatively impacts the semen quality. Our results not only indicate that Leydig cells are susceptible to F-related changes in the testes, but also prove the antagonistic role of IL-17A during the process of F-induced testicular damage. In conclusion, in the present study, we successfully established a simple model of F injury as evidenced by the increased F content in bone. Using this model in WT and IL-17A knockout mice, we were able to demonstrate that IL-17A and its signaling pathways are involved in causing testicular damage in response to fluorosis. Therefore, we conclude that IL-17A deficiency alleviates F-induced testicular injury by inhibiting the immune response and apoptosis in the testis. Although the source of IL-17A stimulated by F needs further investigations, our study provides evidence that IL-17A could be a new target for the treatment of testicular fluorosis.Credit author statement Yanyan Li: Conceptualization, Investigation, Formal analysis, Writing Original, Draft, Yangfei Zhao: Conceptualization, Validation, Methodology, Investigation, Jinming Wang:Investigation:Validation, Writing review & editing, MinCheng：Formal analysis, Jundong Wang: Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
