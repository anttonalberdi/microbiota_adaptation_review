All rights reserved. Abstract Insect-symbiont interactions are known to play key roles in host functions and fitness. The common insect endosymbiont Wolbachia can reduce the ability of several human pathogens, including arboviruses and the malaria parasite, to replicate in insect hosts. Wolbachia does not naturally infect Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue virus, but transinfected Ae. aegypti have anti-dengue virus properties and are currently being trialled as a dengue biocontrol strategy. Here, we assess the impact of Wolbachia infection of Ae. aegypti on the microbiome of wild mosquito populations (adults and larvae) collected from release sites in Cairns, Australia, by profiling the 16S rRNA gene using next generation sequencing. Our data indicate that Wolbachia reduces the relative abundance of a large proportion of bacterial taxa in Ae. aegypti adults, that is in accordance with the known pathogenblocking effects of Wolbachia on a variety of bacteria and viruses. In adults, several of the most abundant bacterial genera were found to undergo significant shifts in relative abundance. However, the genera showing the greatest changes in relative abundance in Wolbachia-infected adults represented a low proportion of the total microbiome. In addition, there was little effect of Wolbachia infection on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa in larvae, or on species diversity (accounting for species richness and evenness together) detected in adults or larvae. These results offer insight into the effects of Wolbachia on the Ae. aegypti microbiome in a native setting, an important consideration for field releases of Wolbachia into the population. Introduction Interactions between insect hosts and their associated microbiome can have substantial impact on host physiology. Broad changes to the microbiome can affect functions including development, fecundity, metabolism and immunity/susceptibility to pathogens (Coon et al. 2014; Gaio Ade et al. 2011; Gall et al. 2016; Ridley et al. 2012). It is also well known that specific symbiotic bacteria of insects can play key roles in host functions (Douglas 2011). Two well-studied systems include the aphids where the A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola synthesizes amino acids that are essential for aphid nutrition (Akman Gündüz & Douglas 2009) and the tsetse fly where Wigglesworthia glossinidia influences diverse host functions including reproduction, digestion and immunity (Pais et al. 2008). More broadly, the overall structure of the microbiome can also be important in the fitness of insects such as bees and mosquitoes, with changes to the composition of the microbiome shown to increase the mortality of bees following exposure to bacterial pathogens (Raymann et al. 2017) and to alter mosquito fecundity (Gaio Ade et al. 2011; Gendrin et al. 2015). It is evident in cases such as these where significant microbiome-host interactions occur, disturbing the insect bacterial population can adversely affect host fitness (Douglas 2011). Factors influencing symbiotic relationships between microbiota and their invertebrate hosts are highly dynamic and have been well documented over the past decade (Osei-Poku et al. 2012; Valiente Moro et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2011). Most notably, host developmental stage, feeding status, and environmental factors including temperature have been shown to significantly influence symbiotic complexity (Lindh et al. 2005; Minard et al. 2013; Osei-Poku et al. 2012; Ramirez et al. 2012; Valiente Moro et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2011; Wernegreen 2012). Additionally, it is also becoming increasingly clear that resident or intrinsic species can shape the overall diversity of the microbiome. For instance, fleas infected with Rickettsia felis show a decrease in species richness in their associated microbiome (Pornwiroon et al. 2007) and the presence of Asaia species in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes impedes vertical transmission of the endosymbiont Wolbachia (Hughes et al. 2014). Wolbachia is a common, maternally inherited, facultative endosymbiont of a wide range of arthropod species. Wolbachia have been shown to alter insect reproductive behaviour and can reduce the ability of pathogens, such as the arbovirus dengue virus (DENV) and the malaria parasite, to replicate in hosts (Bian et al. 2013; Bian et al. 2010; McMeniman et al. 2009; Walker et al. 2011). Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for DENV, is naturally not infected by Wolbachia, but has been stably transinfected (McMeniman et al. 2009). Following large field trials conducted in Queensland, Australia, Wolbachia has invaded the Ae. aegypti population to near fixation (Hoffmann et al. 2011). A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Similar releases are being carried out in a range of DENV endemic regions around the globe as part of a biocontrol initiative (Eliminate Dengue Program; http://www.eliminatedengue.com). Given the large-scale releases of Wolbachia into wild populations of Ae. aegypti globally, it is of interest to understand whether the presence of the endosymbiont has an impact on the mosquito microbiome. The mosquito microbiome has been reported to affect host development (Coon et al. 2014), fecundity (Gaio Ade et al. 2011) and vector competence (Bahia et al. 2014; Boissière et al. 2012; Hegde et al. 2015; Ramirez et al. 2012). As such, changes in the microbiome could negatively affect mosquito health or the anti-DENV effects of Wolbachia, and thereby impact the long-term efficacy of the biocontrol program. Mosquitoes have been the focus of several studies that elucidated the nature of their associated microbiome (Boissière et al. 2012; Dong et al. 2009; Gusmão et al. 2010; Minard et al. 2013; Muturi et al. 2017; Pidiyar et al. 2004; Rani et al. 2009; Valiente Moro et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2011). These include a recent study that has examined the microbiome of field-collected mosquito species Culex pipiens and Ae. albopictus that are naturally infected with Wolbachia (Muturi et al. 2017). However, comparisons across existing studies in an attempt to indirectly determine the potential effect of Wolbachia infection in Ae. aegypti are likely to only offer limited insight due to differences in geographical location, experimental design and mosquito species. To date, the most direct approach has been to characterise the microbiome of Ae. aegypti with and without Wolbachia infection using laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti stably infected with Wolbachia strain wMel (Audsley et al. 2017) and laboratory-reared An. stephensi stably infected with Wolbachia strain wAlbB (Chen et al. 2016). Both of these studies indicated that Wolbachia had little impact on the microbiome, but as laboratory populations have considerably different microbiome compositions than wild mosquitoes (Boissière et al. 2012; Coon et al. 2014; Ramirez et al. 2012), laboratory based studies may not be fully informative. Thus, the potential of Wolbachia to affect the microbiome of wild populations of Ae. aegypti is still unknown. A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. In this study, we investigated the effect of Wolbachia infection on the microbiome of wild caught mosquitoes from Australia, collected from the 2013 release site of Wolbachia wMel-infected mosquitoes from distinct locations in Cairns, Australia (Fig. S1). Using high throughput sequencing, we compared the microbiome structure of Wolbachia-negative and Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti larvae and adults from these sites. Our results show that Wolbachia infection significantly alters the relative abundance of resident bacteria in adult, but not larval, Ae. aegypti. Notably, however, Wolbachia did not affect overall species diversity of the microbiome at either life stage of Ae. aegypti. Materials and methods Sample collection To capture both Wolbachia-infected and uninfected individuals simultaneously, fourth instar Ae. aegypti larval samples were collected from geographically distinct locations in Parramatta Park, Cairns, Australia (Fig. S1). Larvae were collected two weeks post the first release of Wolbachiainfected adult mosquitoes in February 2013, and as such, Wolbachia-positive larvae collected are first generation in the field. Buckets filled with water and some organic matter were placed in shaded areas and 14 days after placement 4th instar larvae were collected and identified to species by morphology. Adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected from the similar geographical locations as the 4th instar larvae (Fig. S1) using BG-Sentinel traps (Biogents). Adults were collected at 12 weeks post the first release of Wolbachia infected mosquitoes, which was 4 weeks post the final release to allow time for any remaining laboratory reared adult release material to have died and ensure that adults collected were at least first generation in the field. Individual larva and adults were placed in separate 3 ml collection tubes filled with 80 % (v/v) ethanol and stored at -20 C until use. DNA extraction & 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplification DNA from each larval and adult sample was extracted using the DNeasy 96 blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Prior to extraction, each sample was washed twice, 5 min per wash in 5 ml 80% ethanol and subsequently rinsed in 5 ml sterile dH2O. Extracted A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. DNA was resuspended in 50 l sterile water, quantified using a spectrophotometer and the concentration adjusted to 5 ng/l. We subsequently tested each sample for Wolbachia infection status and verified that each sample was Ae. aegypti using a multiplex TaqMan RT-PCR assay as described in (Caragata et al. 2013) using primers and probes specific to the WD513 gene of the wMel Wolbachia strain and the Ae. aegypti rps17 gene (Table S1). Each distinct geographical site from which larval and adult samples were collected was treated as a biologically independent sample-set. In total we selected 9 sample-sets, each of which consisted of two pair-matched pools (with exception of one set of larvae that were collected from the same street but different sites; see Fig. S1). Each pool contained the DNA from 10 Wolbachia-positive larvae or female adult mosquitoes and the other containing the DNA from 10 Wolbachia-negative larvae or female adult mosquitoes. When preparing the Wolbachia-positive and Wolbachia-negative pooled DNA care was taken to ensure the pools contained equivalent amounts of DNA from each represented individual. To prepare 16S amplicons for Illumina sequencing, we designed primers targeting the conserved 1100 bp – 1392 bp (for larvae) and 515 bp – 806 bp conserved regions (for adults) of bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Table S1). Different primer sets were used for the two developmental stages due to poor amplification from larval samples with primers designed against the 515 bp – 806 bp region. Illumina adaptor sequences that contained between zero four random nucleotides at the 3’ end were added to each primer to facilitate MiSeq sequencing, such that there were a total of four forward and four reverse primers for each region. Each set of four primers was combined in an equal ratio to a final concentration of 10 M. The respective regions were then amplified using a standard PCR reaction using Phire Hotstart DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher) and 50 ng of DNA from each pool. The resulting amplification products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, the bands excised and subsequently recovered from the gel fragments using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and the DNA dried under vacuum. Separate samples were multiplexed and sequenced using the MiSeq A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Illumina platform at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics, University of New South Wales, Australia using a 2 x 250 bp sequencing run with a 500 cycle MiSeq reagent kit V2. Bioinformatics pipeline A schematic representation of the bioinformatics pipeline we employed is shown in supplementary Fig. S2. Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) picking with QIIME Primers were removed from sequences, by calling the QIIME script split_libraries.py on the joined fastq files described above, using the following parameters: “-b 0” to disable demultiplexing in the script; “-z truncate_only” to remove reverse primers where found, without altering output where no primer was detected; and “-M 2” to allow two mismatches when matching primers because the primers used were degenerate. Quality control thresholds were set to remove any reads with an average quality score under 25 and any sequences under 200 nucleotides in length. We then used QIIME to pick OTUs (97 % identity threshold) using uclust (Edgar 2010), running the QIIME script pick_open_reference_otus.py with GreenGenes 13_8 as the reference OTU collection (Caporaso et al. 2010; DeSantis et al. 2006; McDonald et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2007; Werner et al. 2012). Any taxa/reads assigned to Wolbachia were subsequently filtered and removed using the filter_taxa_from_otu_table.py QIIME script, with parameter -n g_Wolbachia (Tables S2 and S3). On average Wolbachia comprised 8 % of reads in the Wolbachia-positive larvae (range 0.1 % 22 %) and 68 % of reads in Wolbachia-positive adults (range 16 % 85 %). Afterwards, our pipeline summarized the OTUs at the genus level for all Wolbachia-negative and all Wolbachia-positive samples (separately for larvae and adults) with the QIIME summarize_taxa.py script (Tables S4 and S5).

Calculation of differential relative abundance For calculation of differential relative abundance, datasets of OTUs summarized at the genus level by QIIME (above) were imported into Phyloseq and filtered to remove genera with fewer than ten reads to avoid low-count taxa confounding the results. Since the historical method of rarefying counts has been shown to be inappropriate for differential abundance calculation (McMurdie & Holmes 2014), differential abundance of genera across Wolbachia-positive and Wolbachia-negative samples (for both the adult dataset and larvae dataset) was calculated using the edgeR package (Robinson et al. 2010) in conjunction with the Phyloseq package (McMurdie & Holmes 2013, 2014). EdgeR performs robust differential expression analysis of count data from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, using statistical methods based on the negative binomial distribution. Differential abundance was calculated using two separate approaches: 1) with the datasets from the individual collection sites pooled so that all Wolbachia-negative larvae or adults were compared to all Wolbachia-positive larvae or adults using an exact test; and 2) with changes in relative abundance calculated where the collection sites were included as a factor in the statistical analysis. To include the collection site as a factor, we performed the edgeR differential abundance calculation using a linear model. First, we constructed an edgeR design matrix with collection site as a factor. We fitted this matrix to the data using the glmFit() function and performed the calculation for linear abundance using the glmLRT() function to execute a likelihood ratio test. In both cases, Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing (Benjamini & Hochberg 1995). Correlation between the concentration (log counts-per-million; logCPM) and the differential relative abundance (log fold change; logFC) of genera undergoing significant changes in relative abundance in Wolbachia-positive adults used SPSS statistics software (version 22, SPSS Inc, IBM). logCPM and logFC values that were calculated using the linear model to include collection site as a factor of analysis (described above) were used to perform a Pearson’s correlation using a two-tailed test.

Calculation of differential species richness/diversity Phyloseq was also used to estimate species richness and diversity indices using unsummarized taxonomic assignments (raw OTU assignments, 97 % identity threshold) without filtering to remove low count OTUs, using the phyloseq estimate_richness function on the freshly-imported unsummarized QIIME OTU table. Alternate estimates of species diversity were also performed on the unsummarized taxonomic assignments following alpha rarefaction. Results Illumina sequencing output. We examined differential abundance of taxa between Wolbachia-negative and Wolbachia-positive samples of Ae. aegypti larvae and adults by Illumina sequencing, assigning reads to OTUs, and using a statistical model to calculate fold changes in abundance. For the 18 larval samples a total of 16,673,721 pre-filtered reads were obtained. For the 18 adult samples, we obtained 14,226,463 prefiltered reads. Two raw paired-end fastq files for each sample (read length 250 bp) were joined with fqjoin to produce a fastq file of overlapping reads. The mean read length of the joined larvae fastq files were 304.008, whilst the mean read length of the joined adult fastq files were 288.701. The microbiome profiles of larval and adult Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns, Australia. Microbiome profiles of Wolbachia-negative and Wolbachia-positive adults and larvae were produced from datasets that had been corrected for Wolbachia and OTUs were summarized based on classical taxonomy (see materials and methods; Tables S4 and S5). For a broad overview of the microbiome variation across each of the collection sites profiles were constructed using relative abundance of phyla based on datasets summarized by QIIME at the level of phylum (Figs. 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B). Proteobacteria was the clearly dominant phylum, with OTUs belonging to this phylum comprising on average 89.9 % and 81.6 % of the bacteria detected in Wolbachia-negative larvae (Fig. 1A) and adults A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. (Fig. 2A), respectively. The proportion of Proteobacteria in the Wolbachia-corrected microbiome profiles of Wolbachia-positive larvae and adults were similarly high, comprising an average of 93.1 % (Fig. 1B) and 90.2 % (Fig. 2B), respectively. Thus, neither life-stage nor Wolbachia-infection status altered the strong dominance of this phylum. Only the phyla Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria were detected at a relative abundance of greater than 1 % in the larval samples, irrespective of Wolbachia-infection status. In total, OTUs belonging to 30 phyla were detected in the larval samples, but the majority of these were present at low relative abundances of less than 0.1 %. In Wolbachia-negative larvae, there were 5 bacterial phyla that were present at greater than 0.1 % mean relative abundance across the 9 collection sites, which were Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteriodetes (Fig. 1A). Wolbachia-positive larvae had a similar profile but with an additional phylum, Spirochaetes, detected at higher than 0.1 % average relative abundance, which was largely due to a higher relative abundance at a single collection site (site LA; Fig. 1B). Similarly to the larvae, OTUs belonging to 30 phyla were also detected in adult Ae. aegypti and few of these phyla represented substantial proportions of the microbiome. We detected 7 classified bacterial phyla in Wolbachia-negative adults with a mean relative abundance over 0.1 % across the 9 collection sites, which were Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Spirochaetes and Fusobacteria (Fig. 2A). Although the same 7 phyla also had the highest relative abundance in Wolbachia-positive adults (Fig. 2B), there were only 5 phyla with a mean relative abundance greater than 0.1 %, with the Spirochaetes and Fusobacteria reduced in relative abundance. Wolbachia infection alters the relative abundance of bacterial taxa detected in adult Ae. aegypti. To examine changes in relative abundance occurring at a higher level of taxonomic classification in Wolbachia-positive larvae and adults, we used the phyloseq package in conjunction with edgeR. Datasets that formed the basis of these analyses consisted of OTUs that had been assigned taxonomic A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. classifications (as described in the materials and methods) and summarized at the level of genus prior to statistical analysis of changes in relative abundance. For the larval dataset, our analysis to examine relative abundance changes at the taxonomic level of genus compared 534 taxa between Wolbachia-positive and Wolbachia-negative samples. Since we could detect considerable variability in the relative abundance of some of the most abundant taxa between collection sites (see Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4), we first examined changes in relative abundance of taxa across all Wolbachia-negative larvae to all Wolbachia-positive larvae whereby the datasets from all collection sites had been pooled. Using this approach there were only 7 of the 534 taxa that were considered significantly altered between the two groups (Fig. 3, Table S6). When incorporating the individual collection sites as a factor in our analysis (see materials and methods for details), only unclassified Brucellaceae and unclassified Chromatiales, underwent statistically significant changes in relative abundance (Fig. 3, Table S7). Using either analysis approach, taxa found to undergo significant changes each comprised less than 0.01 % of the Wolbachia-negative microbiome, with the exception of Lachnospiraceae (Fig. 4). None of the 12 most abundant genera (Fig. S3) demonstrated significantly altered relative abundance. For adult samples, our analysis of differential relative abundance compared 457 taxa. Comparison of all Wolbachia-negative adults to all Wolbachia-positive adults, where data from the collection sites were pooled, indicated that 277 of the taxa were significantly altered overall between the two groups (Table S8). However, when we included collection site as a factor in our analysis only 64 of these taxa were determined to undergo significant changes in relative abundance in Wolbachia-positive adults (Fig. 5, Table S9). Of these 64 genera, Salinisphaera was the only genus that had increased in relative abundance, and the only genus undergoing relative fold abundance change of > 5 log in either direction. The genera undergoing largest shifts in relative abundance (Spironema, Campylobacter, Brevibacterium and Salinisphaera) each comprise on average less than 1 % of the total microbiome in Wolbachia-negative adults (Fig. 6). However, a number of the taxa calculated to undergo smaller significant changes (decreases) in relative abundance are among the most abundant genera detected in A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Wolbachia-negative adults, including unclassified Comamonadaceae, Strephtophyta, and Streptococcus (Fig. S4). To investigate whether changes in relative abundance correlated with changes in absolute abundance we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Pseudomonas as a representative taxon (Table S10). The 16S profiling indicated that Pseudomonas comprised on average 0.14 % and 0.09 % of the microbiome of Wolbachia-negative and Wolbachia-positive adults, respectively (Fig. 6). By qPCR Pseudomonas was detected above the lower threshold limit of the qPCR assay in 5 out of 7 Wolbachia-negative samples, but only 1 out of 7 Wolbachia positive samples. These data indicate a reduction in the abundance of Pseudomonas in Wolbachia-positive adults (Chi-square test, p = 0.015) that corresponds with our calculation of differential relative abundance by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics analysis using edgeR (Fig. 5). To assess whether there was a relationship between the log fold change and the relative concentration of genera showing differential relative abundance, we plotted log fold change against log counts-permillion from the datasets calculated using the linear model to include collection site as a factor (Fig. 7A, B). Genera undergoing significant changes in relative abundance between Wolbachia-positive compared with Wolbachia-negative samples are shown in red (FDR < 0.05). Of the taxa deemed to undergo significant differential relative abundance in the Ae. aegypti adults, there was no correlation of relative sample concentration to logFC (Pearson’s coefficient = 0.242, p = 0.054). In larval samples a correlation was not calculated, since there were only two genera showing significant changes. Wolbachia infection does not affect species diversity in Ae. aegypti larvae or adults. To estimate species richness (total count of species) we used unsummarized taxonomic assignments of OTUs (97 % identity threshold, not summarized any further by classic taxonomy), corrected for Wolbachia, without filtering out low count OTUs. Species richness in larvae was not affected by the presence of Wolbachia (Table 1. Welch Two Sample t test: p = 0.44 for Observed Wolbachianegative vs Wolbachia-positive larvae; p = 0.56 for Chao 1 Wolbachia-negative vs WolbachiaA cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. positive larvae). In contrast, we detected significantly higher species richness in Wolbachia-negative adults than Wolbachia-positive adults (Table 2. Welch Two Sample t tests: p < 0.0001 for Observed Wolbachia-negative vs Wolbachia-positive adults; p = 0.00014 for Chao 1 Wolbachia-negative vs Wolbachia-positive adults). This may relate to differences in sequencing coverage across the two life stages, with rarefaction analysis suggesting that we have achieved better coverage in larvae compared to adults (Fig. S5). However, Chao 1 estimates based on rarefied data also indicated higher species richness in Wolbachia-negative adults than Wolbachia-positive adults (Table S11). To account for both species evenness and species richness, we used the Simpson’s and Shannon diversity indices (Shannon 1948; Simpson 1949). In both adult and larval samples, we found no difference in Simpson’s (Welch Two Sample t tests: p = 0.23 for adults; p = 0.88 for larvae) or Shannon (Welch Two Sample t tests: p = 0.31 for adults; p = 0.48 for larvae) diversity indices between Wolbachia-positive and Wolbachia-negative samples. Thus, despite an apparent reduction in species richness in the Wolbachia-positive adults, we did not detect a difference in the overall microbiome diversity due to the presence of Wolbachia. Discussion The composition of the mosquito microbiome has been of growing interest due to increasing evidence of its role in vector competence for viral and parasite transmission (Boissière et al. 2012; Cirimotich et al. 2011; Meister et al. 2005; Ramirez et al. 2012). Wolbachia infection of Ae. aegypti is known to decrease vector competence for viruses that significantly impact global health, including DENV, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus (Dutra et al. 2016; Moreira et al. 2009; van den Hurk et al. 2012). As such, the potential of this symbiotic relationship to be exploited as a method to reduce the transmission of arboviruses is currently being explored. Here, we used culture-independent methods to identify the impact of Wolbachia infection on the native microbiome of field-collected larvae and adult female Ae. aegypti. We found that Wolbachia lowers the relative abundance of approximately A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. 14 % of bacterial taxa in adults when compared at the genus taxonomic level, but has no measurable effect on total species diversity at either life stage, when accounting for both species richness and evenness. In Anopheles species it has been established that field-collected adult mosquitoes have limited diversity within their bacterial community, but that the composition can vary between individuals (Boissiere et al. 2012; Osei-Poku et al. 2012). This also appears to be the case for Aedes species (Minard et al. 2014; Valiente Moro et al. 2013). In field-collected Ae. aegypti, Ramirez and colleagues (2012) identified 34 cultivatable species belonging to four phyla in the midgut, with Proteobacteria the dominant phylum. Our study using culture-independent techniques identified genera belonging to 28 phyla detected above our lower threshold for low-count reads, but we similarly identified Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum. Despite variability in microbiome composition across species and individuals, numerous genera identified in our study have also been detected in other studies. These include by culture-dependent methods in field-collected mosquitoes (e.g. Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Comomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas), and by culture-independent methods in ‘semi-field’ conditions (e.g. Novosphingobium, Elizabethkingia, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium) and laboratory-reared mosquitoes (e.g. Elizabethkingia, Sphingobium, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter, Comomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusobacterium) (Audsley et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2016; Ramirez et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2011), adding positive support for our findings. At the level of phylum, the microbiome profiles of adult Ae. aegypti were similar between collection sites, but at higher taxonomic classifications there was high variability between Wolbachia-negative samples and when determining the effect of Wolbachia. This was the case for even the most abundant taxa, where it could be seen that the magnitude and direction of Wolbachia’s effect on some genera were variable. Since individual mosquitoes/larvae were pooled in our study to create one sequencing library per collection site for each Wolbachia-positive and Wolbachia-negative samples, within-site replication would be important for understanding whether Wolbachia could have different effects A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. across sites. Such differences may be accounted for by factors including host genetic background, mosquito age or environmental factors that are not controlled for within this study. The effect of Wolbachia on the abundance of 64 genera, however, was consistent regardless of collection site. This group includes some of the most abundant genera, belonging to a variety of phyla: Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. One consideration when assessing changes to the native microbiota in response to Wolbachia, is their potential involvement in the expression of ‘pathogen-blocking’. When collection site was included as a factor, 63 genera were significantly decreased in relative abundance and only a single genus was increased in relative abundance in Wolbachia-positive adults. However, a greater number of genera were identified that were increased in relative abundance when all collection sites were pooled, including Vagococcus, Salinisphaera and Achromobacter that underwent a fold change of greater than 5 log (Table S8). To our knowledge, only a few of the taxa that were altered in either direction in Wolbachia-positive adults have been examined in the literature with respect to viral interactions in mosquitoes. Pseudomonas and Comamonas, which were reduced in relative abundance, have been shown previously to have no effect on DENV titres in mosquitoes in artificial feeding experiments (Ramirez et al. 2012). Vagococcus, which was increased in the pooled analysis, has been previously identified in Wolbachia-positive insects (Palavesam et al. 2012) and Vagococcus salmoninarium isolated from Ae. albopictus has been shown to directly reduce titres of La Crosse virus by 40 % in vitro, indicating it may have antiviral activity (Joyce et al. 2011). Although our study did not quantify changes in absolute abundance of taxa, it is it is conceivable that Vagococcus could contribute to ‘pathogen-blocking’ in Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti in the field. The antiviral effect reported in Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti appears stronger than that of Vagococcus in vitro (Dutra et al. 2016; Joyce et al. 2011; Walker et al. 2011) but future studies may consider testing for the abundance of Vagococcus species in Wolbachia-positive adults.

Despite the fact that Wolbachia are vertically transmitted, our results indicate that Wolbachia infection has minimal effect on the larval microbiome, which is thought to largely be acquired from their surrounding environment (Coon et al. 2014). Recent work has revealed that while Ae. aegypti require live bacteria for development, they do not rely on particular species (Coon et al. 2016). The authors suggest that the variable nature of aquatic environments would prevent mosquitoes from reliably encountering particular species. In field-collected Ae. aegypti larvae and water from their collection sites, Coon et. al. (2016) detected 28 taxonomic orders present at greater than 2 % relative abundance. In our field-collected larval samples from geographically distinct locations in Cairns, Australia, we detected species from 22 phyla that had sequence counts above our lower limit for abundance comparisons (when OTUs were summarized at genus taxonomic level), and 26 orders identified from these phyla overlap with those identified by Coon et al. (2016). However, in our study only taxa from one phylum were considered significantly altered relative abundance between the two groups when we include collection site as a factor of our analysis. One possible explanation for that the lesser impact of Wolbachia on the larval microbiome in comparison to the adult microbiome is the lower relative abundance of Wolbachia in larvae, such that competition for resources may be a greater factor in Wolbachia-positive adults than Wolbachiapositive larvae. However, it is notable that the reduced relative abundance of a large proportion of taxa in Wolbachia-positive adults is in keeping with the broad bacterial protection effects of Wolbachia (Ye et al. 2013), and thus may be related to upregulation or ‘priming’ of immune pathways such as Toll and IMD (Rancès et al. 2012). While there is evidence to suggest that Wolbachia upregulates expression of immune gene in Drosophila larvae (Zheng et al. 2011), it is unclear if Wolbachia plays a role in pathogen protection in Ae. aegypti during their larval stage. Therefore, it is also possible that life stage-specific differences in immune responses and/or priming, may contribute to the reduced impact of Wolbachia on the relative abundance of other taxa in larvae compared with adults.

A previous study of An. gambiae reared in “semi-natural” habitats found larvae and pupae to have higher diversity than adults (Wang et al. 2011). Comparison of Chao1 and ACE species richness estimates from our study comparing all adults with all larvae (without accounting for Wolbachia infection status) indicate that field-collected Ae. aegypti larvae had greater species richness than adults, while the reverse was true for diversity estimates (Simpon’s and Shannon), which account for both richness and evenness. However, there are several caveats to our study that may influence our estimates of species richness and evenness differentially across the two life stages. First, it is possible that the artificial breeding sites used to sample the larvae may have influenced/limited their microbiome diversity. Second, the use of different primer sets for amplifying the 16S rRNA gene for adults compared to larvae could potentially introduce different bias into the microbiota detected, making direct comparisons between the life stages problematic. Third, species richness estimates in Wolbachia-positive adults may be affected by the greater dominance of Wolbachia, potentially limiting the lower abundance taxa sampled by NGS. Nevertheless, our data indicate that Wolbachia infection status had no significant effect on species diversity in either adults or larvae, when comparing between Wolbachia-positive and Wolbachia-negative samples from a single life stage. Several bacteria have been found previously to negatively affect Wolbachia density or transmission in naturally infected insect hosts. These include Spiroplasma (Drosophila melanogaster) (Goto et al. 2006), Asaia (Anopheles stephensi) (Hughes et al. 2014; Rossi et al. 2015), and co-infection with alternate species of Wolbachia (Callosobruchus chinensis) (Kondo et al. 2005). Ae. aegypti are not naturally infected with Wolbachia species and we did not detect any sequences that could be assigned at the genus or family taxonomic level to Spiroplasma or Asaia in our abundance OTU comparisons for adults or larvae. Thus it is plausible that these known “Wolbachia-incompatible” microbiota are not an impediment to Wolbachia infection/transmission of Ae. aegypti in the geographical locations tested in our study.

Taken together, our results indicate that Wolbachia does not substantially alter the diversity of the microbiota in mosquitoes and has the largest effects on the relative abundance of taxa that comprise a small proportion of the adult Ae. aegypti microbiome. These data therefore do not offer obvious microbial partners that may be assisting with the expression of pathogen blocking. Regardless, the potential involvement of the low frequency genera such as Vagococcus should be further examined experimentally. Perhaps more importantly, however, the limited effects on native microbiome diversity suggest a low potential for Wolbachia to impact host fitness in this capacity. This is especially pertinent in the context of using Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti as a biocontrol strategy against DENV, which relies on vector health for success.
