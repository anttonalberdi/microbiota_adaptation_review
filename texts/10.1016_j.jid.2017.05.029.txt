Thomason1, Laura Campbell1, Gurdeep Singh1, Andrew J. McBain1, Sheena M. Cruickshank1,3 and Matthew J. Hardman2,3The skin microbiome exists in dynamic equilibrium with the host, but when the skin is compromised, bacteria can colonize the wound and impair wound healing. Thus, the interplay between normal skin microbial interactions versus pathogenic microbial interactions in wound repair is important. Bacteria are recognized by innate host pattern recognition receptors, and we previously showed an important role for the pattern recognition receptor NOD2 in skin wound repair. NOD2 is implicated in changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in Crohn’s disease, but its role on skin microbiota is unknown. Nod2-deficient (Nod2e/e) mice had an inherently altered skin microbiome compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, we found that Nod2e/e skin microbiome dominated and caused impaired healing, shown in cross-fostering experiments of wild-type pups with Nod2e/e pups, which then acquired altered cutaneous bacteria and delayed healing. Highthroughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR showed a significant compositional shift, specifically in the genus Pseudomonas in Nod2e/e mice. To confirm whether Pseudomonas species directly impair wound healing, wild-type mice were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and, akin to Nod2e/e mice, were found to exhibit a significant delay in wound repair. Collectively, these studies show the importance of the microbial communities in skin wound healing outcome. Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017) 137, 2427e2436; doi:10.1016/j.jid.2017.05.029INTRODUCTION Skin is colonized by diverse microorganisms, collectively termed the skin microbiome. Recent methodological advances in high-throughput sequencing have shown the complexity of microorganisms associated with skin (Grice et al., 2009; NIH HMP Working Group et al., 2009) and have begun to directly implicate a microbial imbalance, a socalled dysbiosis, in skin health and disease (Achermann et al., 2014). Our skin is also routinely exposed to potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas and Enterobacter species (Grice et al., 2009), and has therefore evolved a tightly regulated innate immune response to actively manage the interactions with the skin microbiome. After injury, it is essential that the skin repairs itself effectively and rapidly. Exposed subcutaneous tissue provides a perfect niche for adventitious pathogens to override the natural microbiome, colonizing the wound (Siddiqui and1Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; and 2School of Life Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, UK 3These authors contributed equally to this work.

Skin cells respond to bacterial invasion via cutaneous pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors and the NOD leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (Kawai and Akira, 2011). PRRs recognize and bind to conserved, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which ultimately leads to induction of proinflammatory cytokines and secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (Kawai and Akira, 2011). NOD2 is an intracellular receptor that recognizes the muramyl dipeptide motif from bacterial peptidoglycans of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Girardin et al., 2003). Mutations in the leucinerich region of the NOD2/CARD15 gene are associated with the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases of barrier organs including Crohn’s disease (Lesage et al., 2002), asthma (Wong et al., 2015), and Blau syndrome (Kurokawa et al., 2003). Recognition of muramyl dipeptide via NOD2 leads to the activation of the NF-kB pathway, inducing a variety of inflammatory and antibacterial factors. Although a number of studies have highlighted roles for PRRs during cutaneous repair, including members of the toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor families (Campbell et al., 2013; Dasu et al., 2010; Lai et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2012), the role of PRRs modulating the wound microbiome during repair remains unclear. Although key studies have provided insight into the regulation of the host-microbiome axis (Grice et al., 2009; Oh et al., 2014), what we now must understand is how cutaneous microorganisms interact with the host and their impact on wound repair. Our previous work showed a previously unreported intrinsic role for murine NOD2 in cutaneous wound healing (Campbell et al., 2013). NOD2 has also beenestigative Dermatology. This is an open access www.jidonline.org 2427 H Williams et al. The Skin Microbiome Influences Healing Outcome 2428implicated in the regulation of the gut microbiome (Philpott et al., 2014). Given the potential importance of host microbiota/skin interactions during tissue repair, we hypothesized a major link between the NOD2 delayed healing phenotype and the role of NOD2 in cutaneous bacteria modulation. Using a NOD2 null murine model, we show fundamental insights into the role of the innate host response in modulating skin bacteria, with direct effects on tissue repair.RESULTS Nod2-deficient mice have an altered skin microbiome To investigate the role of the PRR Nod2 in the skin, we used the murine Nod2e/e model. Histologically, the skin of Nod2e/e mice was comparable to that of wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 1a). However, through density gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), we observed major differences in the Nod2e/e skin microbiome from birth through to adulthood (Figure 1b). 16S rDNA sequencing data of differentially expressed bands indicated enrichment in Pseudomonas species (Figure 1c and d), and this was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), which showed increased relative abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Nod2e/e skin (Figure 1e) and a trend toward reduced commensal species such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (Figure 1e). P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen. Histological Gram staining of skin sections showed no significant difference in the total number of bacteria visualized in the epidermis or dermis. There was, however, a trend toward increased overall numbers of bacterial cells in the dermis of Nod2e/e skin and a corresponding propensity toward increased abundance of Gram-negative bacteria (see Supplementary Figure S1aec online). Injury exacerbates skin microbiome dysbiosis in Nod2deficient mice We next addressed the potential contribution of altered skin microbiome to the healing delay observed in Nod2e/e mice (Campbell et al., 2013) (Figure 2a). Injury increased the total eubacterial abundance in Nod-e/e but not WT mice (Figure 2b). Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed this increased total eubacterial DNA abundance (16S probe) in Nod2e/e mouse wounds (Figure 2c, quantified in Supplementary Figure S2aec online). Despite this increase, the bacterial diversity induced by injury was less pronounced in Nod2e/e than WT mice (60% vs. 40% respective similarity score between skin and wound) (Figure 2d), which agrees with recent observations from Loesche et al. (2017) that wound microbiota stability is associated with delayed healing. Thus, in the absence of Nod2, injury leads to increased relative bacterial abundance, but reduced injury induced changes in bacterial profile. qPCR showed that specific pathogenic species, such as P. aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes, were increased in Nod2e/e mouse wounds (Figure 2e), which was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing (see Supplementary Figure S2d and e). Opportunistic pathogenic species of Pseudomonas are linked to chronic inflammation and wound infection (Fazli et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2011) and are thus clear candidates to confer delayed wound healing.Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017), Volume 137Antimicrobial peptide expression is altered in Nod2-null skin after injury A key component of the antimicrobial host response is the production of AMPs, predominately members of the defensin family (Gallo and Hooper, 2012). Studies in Crohn’s disease patients and Nod2-deficient mice showed reduced a-defensin expression in the intestinal mucosa (Eckmann and Karin, 2005; Maeda et al., 2005). Although a-defensins are absent in the skin, specific AMPs including b-defensins are strongly induced in response to cutaneous injury (Ahrens et al., 2011). Unwounded skin of newborn (i.e., with minimal bacterial exposure) Nod2e/e mice had greater expression of both mBD-1 and mBD-14 than matched WT mice (Figure 3a). Adult injury-induced changes in defensin expression also differed between genotypes, with mBD-1 significantly up-regulated in WT wounds, whereas Nod2e/e wounds displayed abnormal induction of mBD-3 and mBD-14 in response to injury (Figure 3bed). IL-22, a known regulator of mBD-14 expression (Liang et al., 2006), was strongly increased in Nod2e/e wounds. Finally, we confirmed increased mBD-14 at the protein level in vivo, showing a greater extent of keratinocyte expression and an increased number of mBD-14epositive dermal inflammatory cells in adult wound tissue (Figure 3feh). Altered expression of AMPs in the absence of Nod2 may contribute to an altered microbial community, but equally it may reflect the host response to changes in the composition of the skin microbial community, overall bacterial burden, or the cutaneous location of microbes in the tissue. In experiments analyzing mice born by cesarean, the data showed that cutaneous defensin expression was similar between WT and Nod2e/e mice (see Supplementary Figure S3 online), suggesting that defensin profiles change in response to microbial challenge. As Nod2-/mice had an altered microbiome, an important question was then whether skin dysbiosis was sufficient to alter healing outcome and whether this phenotype could be transferrable. Co-housing from birth directly links skin microbiome to healing outcome To address causation and to investigate a potential link between bacterial dysbiosis and healing outcome, we mixed newborn WT and Nod2e/e mice litters from birth with a Nod2e/e mother. WT mice reared in this mixed environment displayed a clear healing delay with significantly increased wound area (Figure 4a and b) and increased local immune cell recruitment (Figure 4c). The reverse experiment was performed whereby newborn WT and Nod2e/e litters were co-housed with WT mothers, and although there was no rescue of delayed healing in Nod2e/e mice, the WT mice had a variable response, with five mice out of eight having delayed healing (see Supplementary Figure S4a and b online) but all showing significantly greater inflammation (see Supplementary Figure S4c), suggesting that the maternal microbiome contribution mediated a partial rescue effect in WT mice. Next we analyzed the microbial communities in wound tissue from the co-housing experiment using 16S rRNA Illumina high-throughput sequencing.

There was also a trend toward reduced alpha diversity between each group when compared with WT, as calculated by the Shannon-Wiener index. When focusing on specific skin microbiota at the phylum level, again using the Shannon-Wiener index, there was a significant change in the diversity of Bacteroidetes species between environment: separately housed WT versus separately housed Nod2e/e and separately housed Nod2e/e versus the co-housed mice (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) (Figure 5c). Furthermore, phylum and genus level taxonomic classification of the wound microbiome is depicted and showed a significantly altered microbial community in separately housed versus co-housed mice, including common skin-associated taxa such as Corynebacterium and Brevibacterium (Figure 5d). Moreover, the microbial community compositions varied between WT and Nod2e/e mice, including the genera Actinobacillus and Campylobacter. The taxonomicinformation for all mapped reads at the genus level can be found in the Supplementary Materials online (see Supplementary Table S1 online). Finally, to confirm these differences we also performed DGGE, which showed that mixing of pups resulted in a major shift in the skin microbiome of both genotypes (50% similarity versus nonmixed), establishing an intermediate skin bacterial profile (w65% similarity between genotypes) (Figure 5e). qPCR confirmed that mixed WTwounds acquired increased abundance of specific bacterial species characteristic of Nod2e/e mice such as P. aeruginosa, accompanied by an overall increase in total eubacterial abundance (Figure 5f). Thus, these data provide compelling experimental evidence that skin microbiome directly influences healing outcome. Direct administration of P. aeruginosa to wild-type mouse wounds significantly delays healing Although we report wide-ranging changes in bacteria in Nod2e/e mice, a common theme across experiments waswww.jidonline.org 2429 ed R el at iv e C op y N um be r 12 * * 10 40 50 60 70 Similarity (%) 80 90 100 WT NS NS D3 D3 4 2 8 6 0 P.aeruginosa P.acnes S.aureus S.epidermidis b a c R el at iv e C op y N um be r 5 * 2 1 4 3 0 WT Nod2-/Nod2-/NS D3 WT Total Eubacterial Abundance Nod2-/N od 2/Nod2-/-Figure 2.

The Skin Microbiome Influences Healing Outcome 2430increased relative abundance of Pseudomonas species. To confirm a direct role for Pseudomonas species in wound repair, we treated full-thickness excisional wounds in WT mice with P. aeruginosa biofilms and assessed subsequent healing (Figure 6a). Significantly delayed healing was observed after direct application of P. aeruginosa to mouse wounds versus nontreated controls (Figure 6b). Treated wounds were larger (Figure 6c), with delayed re-epithelialization (Figure 6d) and increased local inflammation (Figure 6e). These data confirmed that the presence of pathogenic bacteria, similar to wound infection, directly delays murine wound healing and establishes a link to the Nod2e/e phenotype, where a delay in wound repair is associated with an increased cutaneous presence of the genus Pseudomonas. DISCUSSION A wealth of literature has characterized the role of the host response in regulating gut microbiome, with wide-ranging implications for normal physiology and diseaseJournal of Investigative Dermatology (2017), Volume 137(Perez-Chanona et al., 2014; Philpott et al., 2014). By contrast, comparatively few studies have addressed the role of the cutaneous host response-microbiome axis in skin physiology and pathology. We hypothesized that the skin microbiome plays an important role in the cutaneous healing response. Our results show that skin bacterial profiles profoundly influence wound healing outcome. Direct experimental manipulation of the Nod2 gene leads to bacterial dysbiosis associated with local changes in AMPs and ultimately delays healing. Moreover, when WT mice were cohoused from birth with mice lacking Nod2, they acquired an altered microbiome and developed delayed healing. Cutaneous dysbiosis, as shown by eubacterial DNA profiling, 16S high-throughput sequencing, and qPCR, implicated the genus Pseudomonas in murine delayed wound repair, and WT mice infected with P. aeruginosa biofilms confirmed this. These results suggest that microbial therapy directed at bacterial manipulation of the genus Pseudomonas, in addition to other bacterial species previously identified, causes a delay in wound repair, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis f R el at iv e E xp re ss io n 4 ** *** 2 1 3 0 mBD-1 mBD-3 P0 NS mBD-14 D is ta nc e C on tr ib ut io n (m m ) 6 * 2 1 5 3 4 0 WT Nod2-/WT Epidermal mBD-14 Nod2-/e a b c d hg C el ls /m m 2 (x 10 0) 8 * 2 6 4 0 WT Dermal mBD-14 Nod2-/mBD-1 mBD-3 mBD-14 IL-22 Nod2-/mBD-14 N od 2/Nod2-/Nod2-/Nod2-/Figure 3.

The Skin Microbiome Influences Healing Outcome(Schierle et al., 2009), might be an effective strategy to treat wound healing in the future. A growing body of literature links NOD2/CARD15 polymorphisms with a dysregulated innate immune response and susceptibility to diseases, including Crohn’s disease (Lesage et al., 2002), Blau syndrome (Kurokawa et al., 2003), earlyonset sarcoidosis (Kapral, 1966), and graft-versus-host disease (Hoebe et al., 2005). In the gut, NOD2 has a wellcharacterized role in host recognition of bacteria and muramyl dipeptide, which is widely expressed by a variety of commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria (Kanneganti et al., 2007; Kawai and Akira, 2010). Studies in patients with Crohn’s disease and Nod2-deficient mice showed that intestinal changes in bacterial composition are associated with altered a-defensin expression in the intestinal mucosa (Philpott et al., 2014). a-Defensins are not expressed in skin; however, the cutaneous effects of NOD2 are associated with altered b-defensins, yet the exact role these AMPs are playing in our Nod2-null mice remain to be elucidated. Changes in skin b-defensins have previously been linked to skin infection (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) (Zanger et al., 2010) and skin disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis) (Ong et al., 2002). Thus, a picture is emerging across multiple epithelial tissues whereby a loss of NOD2-mediated surveillance activity inhibits local host responses to pathogenic challenge, resulting in aberrant inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. All wounds will be rapidly colonized by resident bacteria, but only some wounds will become “infected.” Considerable recent interest has been focused on the potential ability ofthese colonizing bacteria to form and exist as highly-AMP resistant polymicrobial biofilms (Malone et al., 2017). A number of bacterial genera/species, such as Streptococcus, Enterococcus, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa, have already been linked to infected chronic wounds (Bjarnsholt, 2013; James et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2014). However, the clinical diagnosis for wound infection (in humans) is based on the basic criteria of heat, odor and appearance. In this study we show that similarly appearing murine acute (noninfected) wounds display differences in wound microbiota profile that clearly influence healing outcome. Arguably the most important finding in this study comes from the newborn mouse co-housing experiments, where passive transfer of skin bacteria from Nod2-null to WT mice conferred a “NOD2-like” delayed healing phenotype. The concept of transferring signature bacterial profiles to closely related individuals has now been established clinically. For example, unaffected relatives of Crohn’s disease patients reportedly share some features of the disease-associated microbiome composition (Joossens et al., 2011). Fecal transplant, also referred to as gut microbiome transplant, a procedure in which fecal bacteria from a healthy donor are transplanted into a patient, has shown promise in the treatment of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (Young, 2016). Similarly, cross-strain murine relocation/uterine implantation studies showed that environmental influences dominate the gastrointestinal tract microbiome (Friswell et al., 2010). Our data strongly suggest that the cutaneous microbiome is also highly susceptible to environmental influences, with clearwww.jidonline.org 2431 b a A re a (m m 2 ) 4 * 2 1 3 0 Non-mix WT Mix WT Non-mix Nod2-/Mix Nod2-/WT Wound Area Nod2-/c C el ls /m m 2 3000 * 2000 1500 1000 500 2500 0 WT Neutrophils Nod2-/Nod2-/-Figure 4.

Finally, our data suggest a potential therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of cutaneous dysbiosis in relation to wound repair via microbial manipulation of the skin microbiome. Indeed, mounting research suggests the profound benefits of probiotic supplementation for gut microbiota in health and disease (Gareau et al., 2010; Rolfe, 2000). These may now be extended to other epithelia, including the skin (Mohammedsaeed et al., 2014). MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and wounding All animal studies were performed in accordance with UK Home Office Regulations. All mice used in this study were bred in the same room under the same conditions at the University of Manchester’s Biological Services Facility, where they have been housed for 10 or more generations. Mice were housed in isolator cages with ad libitum food and water. The room was maintained at a constant temperature of 21 C, with 45e65% humidity on a 12-hour lightdark cycle. Nod2-null mice (C57BL/6J background) were bred from homozygous matings and have been described previously (Campbell et al., 2013). WT (C57BL/6J) mice were bred from WT  WT matings onsite to generate controls for experiments. Eight-weekold female mice were anesthetized and wounded following our established protocol (Ansell et al., 2014). Briefly, two equidistant 6-mm full-thickness excisional wounds were made through both skin and panniculus carnosus muscle and left to heal by secondary intention. For co-housing experiments, mice were marked by tattooing, and then 2 or 3 tattooed pups (postnatal day 0) of oneJournal of Investigative Dermatology (2017), Volume 137genotype were placed in the same cage with 2 or 3 tattooed pups (postnatal day 0) of the other genotype and fostered onto WT or Nod2e/e mothers for at least 5 weeks before separation (for weaning). After weaning, only mice of the same sex were housed together before wounding at 6 weeks. P. aeruginosa-infected mouse model An overnight broth culture of P. aeruginosa (National Collection of Type Cultures 10781) was diluted to turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard (optical density ¼ 0.132 at 600 nm) in MuellerHinton broth (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). A total of 50 ml of the diluted culture was applied to 6-mmediameter sterile 0.2-mm filter membranes (Merck Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK) placed on MuellerHinton agar plates. These were then incubated at 37 C for 72 hours, with transfer to a new agar plate every 24 hours. The resultant biofilms were applied to 6-mm excisional wounds and covered with a nonwoven Sawabond 4383 dressing (Sandler, Schwarzenbach/ Saale, Germany). Collection of murine tissue and contralateral skin swabs Excisional wounds were harvested at 1, 3, and 5 days after wounding and bisected (laterally at the midpoint), with one half placed on dry ice for DGGE analysis or fixed in formalin for histology and the remaining half snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at e80 C. Skin swabs from an area of intact contralateral skin were also collected using sterile Dual Amies transport swabs (Duo Transwab; MWE, Wiltshire, UK) and inoculated into 1 ml of transport medium and processed within 3 hours of collection.

PCR amplification and purification The V3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from purified DNA by PCR using GC-rich eubacterium-specific primers P3_GC-341F and 518R (see Supplementary Table S2 online) asJournal of Investigative Dermatology (2017), Volume 137previously described (Walter et al., 2000) using a PTC-100 DNA Engine thermal cycler (Bio-Rad MJ Research, Hertfordshire, UK). Samples were purified using a Qiagen MinElute purification kit (Qiagen.) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. DGGE Polyacrylamide electrophoresis was performed using the D-CODE Universal Mutation Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for perpendicular DGGE. Denaturing gradient gels of 10% (weight/volume) acrylamide-bisacrylamide (37:1:5) were made (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) containing a 30e70% linear gradient of denaturants (urea and formamide), increasing in the direction of H Williams et al. The Skin Microbiome Influences Healing Outcomeelectrophoresis as described previously (Walter et al., 2000). DGGE gel images were aligned and analyzed with BioNumerics software version 4.6 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) in a multistep procedure following the manufacturer’s instructions. After normalizations of the gels, individual bands in each lane of the gel were detected automatically, allowing matching profiles to be generated and used to produce an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean dendrogram. Excision and sequencing of DGGE bands Selected bands were sterilely excised from the gel under UV illumination in 20 ml Nanopure H2O (Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK) in nuclease-free tubes. PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen.) and re-amplified using the reverse 518R primer. Sequencing was performed using BigDye terminator sequencing on an ABI 3730 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) for Sanger sequencing. Sequences obtained were compared with those in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory nucleotide sequence database using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) searches to identify closely related gene sequences. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis 16S amplicon sequencing targeting theV3andV4variable regionof the 16S rRNA gene (see Supplementary Table S2) was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc, Cambridge, UK). The raw amplicon data were further processed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology (i.e., QIIME) version 1.9.0 (Caporaso et al., 2010) and R version 3.3.1 (R Core Team, 2016). The non-metric multidimensional scaling plot and the Shannon-Weiner index were created using the isoMDS function in the MASS package (Venables and Ripley, 2002) in R, and the statistical analysis was performed using the Adonis function in the vegan package (Okansen et al., 2016) in R. Hucker-Twort Gram stain TheHucker-Twort Gram stainwas used to distinguishGram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in formalin-fixed tissue. Tissuewas floodedwith crystal violet stain for 3 minutes and rinsed with running H2O. Gram’s iodine was added for 3 minutes and washed with H2O. After differentiation in preheated acetic alcohol at 56 C, tissue was immersed with Twort’s stain for 5 minutes and washed with H2O. Slides were rinsed in alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted with DPX mountant (SigmaAldrich, Dorset, UK); the slides were imaged using a 3D Histech Pannoramic 250 Flash Slide Scanner (3D Histech, Budapest, Hungary). qPCR Bacterial DNA and/or total RNAwas isolated from frozen skin or wound tissue as previously described or by homogenizing in Trizol reagent using the Purelink RNA kit (Invitrogen by Life Technologies., Paisley, UK) according to themanufacturer’s instructions. cDNAwas transcribed from 1 mg of RNA (Promega RT Kit, Hampshire, UK) and AMVreverse transcriptase (Roche,West Sussex,UK), and qPCRperformedusing the SYBR Green I core kit (Eurogentec, Hampshire, UK) and an Opticon quantitative PCR thermal cycler (BioRad, Hertfordshire, UK). The primer sequences for real-time qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Histology and immunohistochemistry Histological sectionswereprepared fromnormal skin andwound tissue fixed in 10% buffered formalin saline and embedded in paraffin. 5mmol/L sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using the following antibodies: rat anti-neutrophil polyclonal (Fisher Scientific) and chicken anti-BD-14 polyclonal (a generous gift from Thomas Hehlgans, University ofRegensburg, Regensburg, Germany). Primary antibody was detected using the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody followed by ABC-peroxidase reagent (Vector Laboratories, Peterbourgh, UK) with NovaRed substrate and counterstainingwith hematoxylin. Imageswere captured using an Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon, Surrey, UK) and a SPOT camera (Image Solutions., Preston, UK). Total cell numbers, bacterial counts, granulation tissue wound area, and reepithelialization were quantified using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Buckinghamshire, UK). Fluorescence in situ hybridization The deparaffinized tissue sections were systematically analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes. A mixture of a CY3-labelled universal bacterium peptide nucleic acid probe in hybridization solution (AdvanDx., Woburn, MA) was added to each section andhybridized in apeptidenucleic acidfluorescence in situ hybridizationworkstationat 55 C for90minutes. Slideswerewashed for 30 minutes at 55 C in wash solution (AdvanDx.), mounted in DAPIcontaining mountant, and stored in the dark at e20 C. Slides were visualized using a DMLB 100s LeicaMicrosystemsmicroscope attached to a LeicaMicrosystems fluorescence system (Lecia,Milton Keynes,UK). Images were captured using a RS Phototmetrics Coolsnap camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and overlaid using Adobe Photoshop Elements version 6.5 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Electron microscopy Samples were processed as previously described (Kimura et al., 2007), with the exception that 4% paraformaldehyde and 2 mmol/ L CaCl2 were used in the primary fixative and 2% OsO4 in the secondary fixative. Images were acquired using the Orius CDD SC1000 camera (Gatan, Oxon, UK). Statistical analysis All data are presented as meanþ standard error of the mean. Normal distribution and statistical comparisons between groups were determined using Shapiro-Wilk test, Student t test (two tailed), or two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni posttest where appropriate using GraphPad Prism 7 version 7.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) as indicated in the figure legends. For all statistical tests, the variance between each group was determined, and probability values of P less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
