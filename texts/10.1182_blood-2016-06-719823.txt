Hamerman1,2 1Immunology Program, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA; 2Department of Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA; and 3Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY Key Points • BCAP is expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and inhibits myeloid cell development in a cell-intrinsic manner. • In the absence of BCAP, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are more proliferative, particularly in demand situations. B-cell adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (BCAP) is a signaling adaptor expressed in mature hematopoietic cells, including monocytes and neutrophils. Here we investigated the role of BCAP in the homeostasis and development of these myeloid lineages. BCAP2/2 mice had more bone marrow (BM) monocytes than wild-type (WT) mice, and in mixed WT:BCAP2/2 BM chimeras, monocytes and neutrophils skewed toward BCAP2/2 origin, showing a competitive advantage for BCAP2/2 myeloid cells. BCAP was expressed in BM hematopoietic progenitors, including lineage2Sca-11c-kit1 (LSK), common myeloid progenitor, and granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) cells. At the steady state, BCAP2/2GMPcells expressedmore IRF8 and less C/EBPa than did WT GMP cells, which correlated with an increase in monocyte progenitors and a decrease in granulocyte progenitors among GMP cells. Strikingly, BCAP2/2 progenitors proliferated and produced more myeloid cells of both neutrophil and monocyte/ macrophage lineages than did WT progenitors in myeloid colony-forming unit assays, supporting a cell-intrinsic role of BCAP in inhibiting myeloid proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with these findings, during cyclophosphamide-induced myeloablation or specific monocyte depletion, BCAP2/2 mice replenished circulating monocytes and neutrophils earlier than WT mice. During myeloid replenishment after cyclophosphamide-inducedmyeloablation, BCAP2/2mice had increased LSK proliferation and increased numbers of LSK andGMP cells compared withWTmice. Furthermore, BCAP2/2 mice accumulated more monocytes and neutrophils in the spleen than didWT mice during Listeria monocytogenes infection. Together, these data identify BCAP as a novel inhibitor of myelopoiesis in the steady state and of emergency myelopoiesis during demand conditions. (Blood. 2017;129(11):1503-1513) Introduction Hematopoiesis governs the production of mature cells of the erythroid, lymphoid, and myeloid lineages.1 Hematopoiesis begins in bone marrow (BM) in adult mice, with the quiescent, self-renewing, longterm hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), which provide lifelong generation of mature hematopoietic cells. Hematopoiesis from LT-HSCs occurs through a series of progenitor cells that have increasingly restricted lineage potential throughout their differentiation.2,3 Hematopoiesis ensures maintenance of all lineages in the steady state. However, this process is tightly regulated to respond to demand situations, including myeloablation and infection, when hematopoiesis is accelerated and altered to favormyeloid cell generation at the expense of lymphoid cell generation, a condition known as emergency myelopoiesis.4 A wide variety of signaling pathways and transcription factors regulate hematopoiesis at both the steady state and during demand situations, allowing for control of this dynamic system. B-cell adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), BCAP, is a signaling adaptor protein that is expressed in hematopoietic cells.5 BCAP was identified in B cells, where it activates PI3K downstream of the B-cell receptor6 and is a positive regulator of B-cell development and homeostasis.5,7 BCAP is also expressed in natural killer cells, where it functions as a negative regulator of maturation and function.8 More recently, we and others showed that in mature macrophages, BCAP promotes PI3K activation downstream of Toll-like receptors, thereby negatively regulating Toll-like receptor–induced inflammation.9,10 Thus, BCAP is expressed in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages and can perform varying functions within different hematopoietic cell populations. Here we show that BCAP is expressed within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and functions as a novel negative regulator of myeloid cell development.

Mixed BM chimeras were generated by lethally irradiating (1000 rad) recipient C57BL/6 3 B6.SJL F1 mice and reconstituting with a 1:1 ratio of 5 3 106 B6.SJL (CD45.11) and either 5 3 106 C57BL/6 (CD45.21) or BCAP2/2 (CD45.21) BM cells. For experiments with Ccr2-depleter mice, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 ng/g diphtheria toxin (DT) (List Biological Laboratories) in phosphate-buffered saline. For myeloablation experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 175 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline. For proliferation, mice were injected intraperitoneallywith 1mg/mL5-bromo-29-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 1 hour. BrdU incorporation was assayed using the BD BrdU Flow Kit (BD Biosciences). Blood samples were obtained via saphenous vein. For infection experiments, mice were injected intravenously with 3000 colony-forming units (CFUs) of Listeria monocytogenes (strain 10403S). Cell isolation and staining Mouse splenocytes, blood cells, and BM cells were isolated and stained with antibodies for flow cytometry, as previously described.12,13 Lineage2 BM cells were isolated using a Lineage Cell Depletion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Intracellular staining for BCAP was conducted by fixing lineage2 BM cells with Cytofix/ Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences) and staining in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences). Cells were blocked with rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) (SigmaAldrich), stainedwithmouseanti-BCAPIgG1antibody,8 and then stained with anti-mouse IgG1-Allophycocyanin (BD Biosciences), followed by staining for surface proteins; all steps were conducted at 4°C. Apoptosis was analyzed by staining for Annexin V with Annexin V Binding Buffer (eBioscience) and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). Intranuclear staining for IRF8 was conducted by fixing and permeabilizing sorted lineage2 BM cells with FoxP3/Transcription Factor Fixation/Permeabilization buffer (Tonbo). Intracellular staining for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was conducted by incubating cells for 4 hours at 37°C in GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) directly ex vivo, followed by permeabilization and intracellular staining. All monoclonal antibodies used for flow cytometry are listed in supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site. Data were acquired using an LSR II or FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 2. Statistical analyses Data were analyzed by Student’s unpaired t test using Prism (GraphPad). Results BCAP differentially regulates myeloid and lymphoid cell development and/or homeostasis The role ofBCAP in the development and homeostasis ofmyeloid cells has not been investigated. We therefore examined the numbers of neutrophils and monocytes of wild-type (WT) and BCAP2/2 mice in the steady state. WT and BCAP2/2 mice had similar numbers of CD11b1Ly6G1Ly6Cint neutrophils in the BM, blood, and spleen, and similar numbers of CD1151CD11b1Ly6G2Ly6C2 resident monocytes in the blood (supplemental Figure 1). However, whereasWT and BCAP2/2 mice had similar numbers of CD11b1Ly6G2Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes in the blood and spleen, BCAP2/2 BM had a significant,;25% increase in inflammatory monocyte numbers comparedwithWTBM. Increases in the percentage of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in the spleen were likely a result of the decrease in mature B cells (not shown).5,7 Todeterminewhether this increasedmonocytenumber inBCAP2/2 BM was cell intrinsic, we created mixed BM chimeras by transferring congenically markedWT (CD45.11) and BCAP2/2 (CD45.21) BM at a 1:1 ratio to lethally irradiated F1 recipient mice (CD45.11CD45.21), followed by reconstitution for.8 weeks. Whereas WT:WT chimeras reconstituted inflammatorymonocytes in an;1:1 ratio, BCAP2/2:WT chimeras exhibited an ;2.5:1 ratio of BCAP2/2 to WT monocytes in the BM, blood, and spleen (Figure 1A-B). This selective advantage for BCAP2/2 cells was also present within neutrophils (Figure 1A-B). In contrast, splenic follicular and marginal zone B cells were skewed toward WT origin, showing a selective disadvantage for BCAP2/2-derivedBcells (Figure 1C).Therefore,BCAPplays distinct roles in myeloid and lymphoid cell development and/or homeostasis. We askedwhether the competitive advantage ofBCAP2/2myeloid cells is a result of increased survival compared with their WT counterparts, and therefore we examined ex vivo apoptosis by staining monocytes and neutrophils for Annexin V and propidium iodide. However,we found thatWTandBCAP2/2neutrophils andmonocytes undergo apoptosis at similar rates (supplemental Figure 2).Because this selective advantage of BCAP2/2 myeloid cells began in the BM and was independent of cell survival,we hypothesized that BCAP regulates myeloid cell development within the BM. BCAP is expressed within HSPCs Inflammatorymonocytes and neutrophils develop duringmyelopoiesis from HSPCs in the BM.3 To determine if BCAP regulates myelopoiesis, we first examined whether BCAP is expressed within BM HSPCs. BCAP was expressed in lineage2Sca-11c-kit1 (LSK), CMP, and GMP populations, whereas no BCAP expression was detected in megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) cells (Figure 2A-B; supplemental Figure 3A). LSK cells expressed the highest amount of BCAP, whereas BCAP expression was similar in CMP and GMP cells. We also examined BCAP expression in the LT-HSCs, short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and multipotent progenitor (MPP)populations usingCD150andCD48 to identify these cells among LSK cells (supplemental Figure 3A). BCAP was expressed as early as LT-HSCs, and had the highest expression in MPP cells (Figure 2C-D).

BCAP2/2 mice have similar numbers of hematopoietic progenitors compared with WT mice Because in the steady state, BCAP2/2BMhad an increased number of inflammatory monocytes and a competitive advantage in repopulating myeloid lineages, we hypothesized that BCAP2/2 mice may have increased BM progenitor populations. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found similar numbers and frequencies of LSK, CMP,GMP, andMEP cells within WT and BCAP2 /2 BM (Figure 3A; supplemental Figure 3B). WT and BCAP2/2 mice also had similar numbers of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) within the BM (supplemental Figure 3C-D). Therefore, BCAP2/2 mice exhibit similar progenitor homeostasis compared with WT mice in the steady state. Altered myeloid-specifying transcription factor expression in BCAP2/2 progenitors Although WT and BCAP2/2 mice have similar numbers of myeloid progenitors, we hypothesized that BCAP may affect the expression of transcription factors that control myelopoiesis.14 Pu.1, the master regulator of myeloid differentiation, governs the differentiation of LSK cells into CMPs andCLPs.15,16 C/EBPa regulates the differentiation of CMPs into GMPs and supports granulocyte differentiation,17 whereas IRF8 cooperates with Pu.1 to promote monocyte differentiation from GMPs.18 We examined the expression of Pu.1, C/EBPa, and IRF8 by qRT-PCR in sorted progenitors. Pu.1 was expressed at similar or slightly increased levels in WT and BCAP2/2 LSK, CMP, and GMP cells (Figure 3B). BCAP2/2 LSK and CMP cells had significantly increased expression of C/EBPa and IRF8 compared with WT cells, whereas BCAP2/2GMP cells had less C/EBPa and higher IRF8 than WT GMP cells. When examining IRF8 protein levels in progenitors, we found that BCAP2/2mice had a greater proportion of IRF81LSK, CMP, and GMP cells (Figure 3C-D). However, the amount of IRF8 protein per cell, as measured by the mean fluorescence intensity of the IRF8-expressingpopulation,wassimilar inWTandBCAP2/2progenitor cells. Therefore, the increased number of IRF81 progenitors combined with the decreased expression of C/EBPa in BCAP2/2 GMP cells suggests thatBCAP2/2GMPcellsmayfavormonocyteovergranulocyte production in the steady state, consistent with the increased monocyte numbers found in the BMof BCAP2/2mice (supplemental Figure 1B). Increased proportion of monocyte progenitors in BCAP2/2 mice Recently, several subsets of GMPs were identified through differential expression of Ly6C and CD115.19 Ly6CloCD115lo oligopotent GMPs (early GMPs) differentiated into both monocytes and neutrophils. Ly6ChiCD115lo GMPs differentiated primarily into neutrophils and were termed granulocyte progenitors (GPs), whereas Ly6ChiCD115hi GMP primarily differentiated into monocytes and were called monocyte progenitors (MPs). Because of the increased frequency of IRF81 cells and decreased expression of C/EBPa in BCAP2/2 GMPs, we examined whether BCAP2/2 GMPs have altered frequencies of MPs and GPs compared with WT GMPs. Indeed, BCAP2/2 mice had an increased frequencyofMPs and a decreased frequency ofGPs thanWT mice, whereas the frequency of early GMPswas similar (Figure 3E-F). Therefore, although progenitor frequencies are identical between WT and BCAP2/2 mice up to the early GMP stage, BCAP2/2 mice have moreMPs, suggesting that steady-statemyelopoiesis inBCAP2/2mice may favor monocyte differentiation over neutrophil differentiation. BCAP2/2 myeloid progenitors outcompete WT progenitors in mixed BM chimeras Next, we asked whether BCAP2/2 progenitors have a competitive advantage compared with WT progenitors by examining their repopulation inmixedBM chimeras reconstituted with equal numbers of WT and BCAP2/2 BM cells. In these mixed chimeras, CMP cells were significantly skewed toward BCAP2/2 origin, and LSK, GMP, and MEP cells had a trend in skewing toward BCAP2/2 origin (supplemental Figure 3E). In contrast, CLP populations in BCAP2/2: WT chimeras were similar toWT:WT control chimeras (supplemental Figure 3F). Therefore, BCAP deficiency may confer a selective advantage for myeloid progenitors and MEPs, but does not appear to affect lymphoid progenitors. Increased myeloid cell production from BCAP2/2 HSPCs To directly assess whether BCAP-deficient HSPCs have an increased capacity to produce myeloid cells, we sorted LSK, CMP, and GMP cells intomethylcellulosemedia containing SCF, IL-3, and IL-6, which drives granulocyte and macrophage colony differentiation. At day 5, WTandBCAP2/2LSK,CMP, andGMPcells formed similar numbers of total colonies and of granulocyte, macrophage, and mixed granulocyte/macrophage colonies (Figure 4A). However, when we quantified the cell yields in the cultures, BCAP2/2 LSKs, CMPs, and GMPs produced significantly more cells than their WT counterparts (Figure4B). Interestingly,BCAP2/2GMPculturesproduced increased numbers of both mature macrophages and neutrophils compared with WT GMP cultures (Figure 4C; supplemental Figure 4A), suggesting that upon strong cytokine stimulation, BCAP2/2 progenitors lose their bias toward monocyte production and produce more cells of both the monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil lineages. To determine if this increased cell yield is unique to specific myelopoiesis-promoting cytokines, we sorted WT and BCAP2/2 GMPs into methylcellulose media containing M-CSF, GM-CSF, or G-CSF. Similarly to the SCF, IL-3, and IL-6 cultures, BCAP2/2GMP producedmoremyeloid cells than theirWT counterparts in response to M-CSF and GM-CSF, whereas minimal differences were apparent in G-CSF–stimulated cultures (supplemental Figure 4B). Additionally, BCAP2/2 cultures stimulated with GM-CSF produced more mature macrophages and neutrophils than didWT cultures (Figure 4E). Thus, similar to the skewing in mixed BM chimeras, BCAP2/2 progenitors cell-intrinsically produce increased numbers ofmyeloid cells compared with WT progenitors. Because BCAP2/2 HSPCs produced more myeloid cells, we hypothesized that BCAP limits either survival or proliferation during myeloid differentiation. BCAP2/2 LSK cultures had more, not less, active caspase-31 cells than did WT at day 6 of culture (supplemental Figure 4C), showing that the increased cell yield was not a result of BCAP2/2 cells being more resistant to apoptosis. We next examined proliferation in the methylcellulose cultures using BrdU incorporation. At all days of culture examined, BCAP2 /2 LSK–derived cells incorporated more BrdU than did their WT counterparts (Figure 4E). Similarly, at day 4, BCAP2/2 CMP–derived cells incorporated more BrdU than their WT counterparts. GMP cultures had very low BrdU incorporation, and we found no significant difference in WT and BCAP2/2GMP cultures at any time examined. Thus, cultures derived from early BCAP2/2 progenitors have increased proliferation and produce more myeloid cells than those from WT progenitors, BLOOD, 16 MARCH 2017 x VOLUME 129, NUMBER 11 BCAP INHIBITS MYELOPOIESIS 1507 D ow nloaded from http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/129/11/1503/1399182/blood719823.pdf by guest on 21 January 2022 Granulocyte/Macrophage Macrophage Granulocyte LSK WT BCAP-/Co lo ny fo rm in g un its 0 200 300 100 CMP WT BCAP-/Co lo ny fo rm in g un its 0 100 150 50 0 GMP WT BCAP-/Co lo ny fo rm in g un its 60 100 20 40 80 A B WT BCAP-/3 5 6 7 Days post-culture 0 1 2.5 1.5 .5 Ce lls (x 1 06 ) 2 * 4 LSK 73 4 5 6 Days post-culture 0 1 2.5 1.5 .5 Ce lls (x 1 05 ) 2 * * CMP 3 4 5 6 Days post-culture 0 2 5 3 1 4 Ce lls (x 1 04 ) * GMP 30 10 0 40 20 Br dU + (% ) 3 4 6 Days post-culture CMP 5 ** * 8 2 0 10 4 3 4 6 Days post-culture GMP 5 6 Br dU + (% ) 3 Days post-culture 60 20 0 80 40 Br dU + (% ) 1 2 LSK * * p=.067 E C D GM-CSF Mature Macrophages 0 8 10 6 Ce lls (x 1 03 ) 2 3 4 5 2 4 * Days post-culture Mature Neutrophils 0 Ce lls (x 1 04 ) 2 3 4 5 4 5 3 1 2 * * Days post-culture SCF + IL-3 + IL-6 Mature Macrophages 0 1 3 2 Ce lls (x 1 03 ) 2 3 4 5 p=.094 Days post-culture Mature Neutrophils 0 1 3 2 Ce lls (x 1 04 ) 2 3 4 5 p=.070 Days post-culture Figure 4.

Because of the increase in cells produced by BCAP2/2HSPCs, we asked whether BCAP regulates the maturation of myeloid progenitors. As shown previously, the differentiation ofCMP intoGMPcells can be observed ex vivo by upregulation of the Fcg receptors CD16/32. BCAP2/2 CMP cultures had more CD16/32hi cells than did WT cultures starting at 4hours, and this increasewasmaintained throughout the culture (Figure 5A-B). Therefore, BCAP2/2 CMPs exhibited accelerated differentiation into GMP cells compared withWT CMPs. BCAP2/2 have an increased proportion of IL-6Ra1 cells among HSPCs Because BCAP2/2mice had an increased proportion of IRF81 cells in all HSPCs (Figure 3), we next asked if BCAP2/2 HSPCs are better primed for myeloid differentiation. Myelopoiesis is predominantly induced by cytokine signals, including IL-6.20,21 The IL-6 receptor is comprisedof the IL-6 receptora subunit (IL-6Ra) and thegp130chain, both of which are expressed on HSPCs.22,23 Because the IL-6/IL-6Ra axis promotes myelopoiesis during infection and myeloablation,23-27 weexamined the expressionof the IL6Ra subunit onWTandBCAP2/2 HSPCs. As expected, IL-6Ra was expressed at increasing levels on HSPCs as monocyte/neutrophil commitment increased, from LSK to CMP to GMP (Figure 6A). Interestingly, BCAP2/2 LSK, CMP, and GMP cells had significantly more IL-6Rahi cells than their WT counterparts (Figure 6B), suggesting that BCAP regulates HSPC fate decision from as early as the LSK stage to inhibit myeloid cell production. BCAP2/2 mice have increased monocytes and neutrophils during demand situations During situations of demand, such as infection or myeloablation, hematopoiesis adapts to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells in a process known as emergency myelopoiesis. To determine if BCAP controls monocyte and neutrophil production during demand situations, we used several in vivo models. First, we used Ccr2-depleter mice, in which the gene for the simian DT receptor is expressed under control of the regulatory elements forCcr2,11which is highly expressed in inflammatory monocytes.28 A single dose of DT in Ccr2-depleter mice depletes mature inflammatory monocytes for 48 hours. After a single DT injection, we compared the reconstitution of blood inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in WT/Ccr2-depleter and BCAP2/2/Ccr2-depleter mice. Monocytes were similarly depleted fromWT/Ccr2-depleter andBCAP2/2/Ccr2-depletermice by24hours post-DT treatment, and depletion was maintained for 48 hours (Figure 7A). At 96 hours post-DT treatment, BCAP2/2/Ccr2-depleter mice had fully replenished their circulating monocytes to steady-state numbers, whereas WT/Ccr2-depleter mice had replenished their monocytes to only ;50%. BCAP2/2/Ccr2-depleter mice also had increased numbers of neutrophils in the blood compared with WT/ Ccr2-depletermice, suggesting that replenishment ofmonocytesoccurs from a bipotent progenitor with monocyte and neutrophil potential. Therefore, after specificmonocyte depletion, BCAP2/2monocytes are replenished faster thanWTmonocytes, with a concomitant increase in circulating neutrophil numbers. We also examined monocyte and neutrophil replenishment after myeloablation with the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide causes rapid depletion of mature myeloid cells followed by recovery as a result of new hematopoiesis.29,30 A single dose of cyclophosphamide inducedmonocyte and neutrophil depletion to;1% of pretreatment numbers in both WT and BCAP2/2 mice by 48 hours (Figure 7B). Strikingly, BCAP2/2mice had fully replenished their circulating monocytes and neutrophils to steady-state levels by 96 and 120 hours, respectively, whereas WT mice had only reached ;40% of steady-state levels at these time points. Therefore, BCAP2/2 mice replenish theirmonocytes and neutrophils faster than doWTmice after cyclophosphamide-induced myeloablation. Because of this accelerated replenishment of mature myeloid cells inBCAP2/2mice,wehypothesized thatBCAP2/2HSPCswould have increased proliferation after cyclophosphamide treatment compared with WT mice. BCAP2/2 LSK cells exhibited increased BrdU incorporation in comparison with WT LSK cells 48 hours after cyclophosphamide treatment (Figure 7C-D), whereas BrdU incorporation was not significantly different in WT and BCAP2/2 CMP and GMPcells. Furthermore,BCAP2/2mice exhibited increased numbers of LSK and GMP cells compared with WT mice by 48 hours after cyclophosphamide treatment (Figure 7E). Therefore, the increase in monocyte and neutrophil reconstitution after cyclophosphamide treatment correlated with changes in HSPCs. Last, we examined monocyte and neutrophil numbers during infection with the gram-positive bacteria L monocytogenes. Neutrophils and CCR21 monocytes accumulate in the spleen during L monocytogenes infection, and monocytes are critical for L monocytogenes clearance.28,31-33 Concurrently, this infection-induced demand drives emergency myelopoiesis in the BM for rapid production ofmonocytes andneutrophils to further combatLmonocytogenes.34,35 In WT mice, monocyte numbers increased in the spleen at day 2 after CD16/32 0 60 100 80 40 20 CD 16 /3 2h i ( % ) 0 5 10 15 20 25 Time post-culture (Hrs) ** *** **** WT BCAP-/A B 0 4 8 24 Time (Hrs) Figure 5.

BLOOD, 16 MARCH 2017 x VOLUME 129, NUMBER 11 BCAP INHIBITS MYELOPOIESIS 1509 D ow nloaded from http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/129/11/1503/1399182/blood719823.pdf by guest on 21 January 2022 L monocytogenes infection, and peaked at day 3 following infection (Figure7F). Incontrast,BCAP2/2mice reachedpeakmonocytenumbers in the spleen at day 2 postinfection, a full day ahead of WT mice. Neutrophil numbers peaked at postinfection day 2 for both WT and BCAP2/2 mice; however, peak neutrophil numbers were significantly higher inBCAP2/2mice.Consistentwith the critical role thatmonocytes play during L monocytogenes infection,28,31,32 BCAP2/2 mice had increased numbers of activated monocytes, as determined by TNF and iNOS staining, in the spleen at postinfection day 2 comparedwith WTmice, despite a lower frequency of TNF1 and iNOS1monocytes in the spleen of BCAP2/2mice compared with WTmice at this time point (supplemental Figure 5). Furthermore, the increased accumulation of monocytes and neutrophils in BCAP2/2 mice correlated with increased clearance of L monocytogenes in the spleen and liver comparedwithWTmice (Figure 7G). Therefore, in demand situations that require rapid emergency myelopoiesis, BCAP serves to restrain monocyte and neutrophil generation. Discussion Here we show that BCAP2/2 mice exhibit an increased ability to generate myeloid cells from their HSPCs compared with WT mice. Specifically, BCAP2/2HSPCs produced more myeloid cells thanWT HSPCsboth in culture and in vivo at the steady state andduringdemand situations. Whereas BCAP has several different functions in mature hematopoietic cells, we have identified a unique role for BCAP during myelopoiesis. The most profound effect of BCAP during myelopoiesis is its ability to restrain differentiation and proliferation of HSPCs when they are placed in demand situations. In the CFU assays, when HSPCswere removed from their niche and induced to proliferate and differentiate with strong cytokine signals, BCAP2/2 LSK, CMP, and GMP cells all produced increased numbers of myeloid cells compared with WT cells. In all 3 in vivo situations of demandadapted myelopoiesis that we examined, including cell ablation and bacterial infection, BCAP2/2mice also showed an increased output of monocytes and neutrophils at early time points. Furthermore, in the Ccr2-depleter model, although only inflammatory monocytes were specifically depleted, both monocyte and neutrophil numbers were increased in BCAP2/2 mice, which shows that the effect of BCAP is on an oligopotent progenitor, not a committed monocyte progenitor, in this model. That BCAP can inhibit demand-adapted myelopoiesis in these diversemodels suggests that BCAP regulates a critical early step in these processes. Proliferation of HSPCs is modulated by multiple factors, including cytokines, signaling pathways, and transcription factors.4,14,36-38 BCAP2/2 HSPCs exhibited increased proliferation both in the CFU assays, as well as during cyclophosphamide-induced myeloablation. Interestingly, BCAP2/2GMPsproduced increased numbers ofmyeloid cells compared with WT GMPs in response to M-CSF, GM-CSF, and combined SCF, IL-3, and IL-6, cytokines that signal from distinct receptors, suggesting that BCAP regulates expression or function of a downstream common component of diverse signaling pathways. In addition to restrainingproliferation,BCAPmayalsocontribute to increased demand-adapted myelopoiesis by slowing differentiation. Indeed, we found that BCAP-deficient CMPs progressed to the GMP stage faster than WT GMPs, and BCAP-deficient GMPs generated mature macrophages in response to GM-CSF faster than WT cells. Similarly, during infection with L monocytogenes, BCAP-deficient mice generated myeloid cells faster than WT mice by day 2 after infection.Whereas many studies have investigated factors that regulate HSPCproliferation, little isknownaboutwhat regulates the speedof the HSPC differentiation process and how this links to proliferation, which increases as HSPCs become more committed. Our study shows that BCAP is a novel inhibitor of this process. We also found that in the absence of BCAP, all HSPC populations examined had increased proportions of IL-6Ra1 cells. IL-6R signaling onHSPCs blocks lymphopoiesis and increasesmyelopoiesis.22,24 Given that IL-6 is induced during infection,26,39 autoimmunity,22 and cyclophosphamide-induced myeloablation,30,40 IL-6 signaling is likely A IL-6Rα LSK CMP GMP Isotype Control B 0 15 25 20 10 IL -6 Rα hi (% ) 5 ** IL -6 Rα hi (% ) 0 60 40 20 ** 0 60 80 40 20IL -6 Rα hi (% ) *** WT BCAP-/IL-6Rα WT BCAP-/Isotype Control GMPLSK CMP Figure 6.

We also identified IL-6Ra expression as a marker of HSPC maturation along the myeloid differentiation pathway; therefore, the increased proportion of IL-6Rahi cells among BCAP2/2 HSPCs suggests they are more myeloid-primed than WT HSPCs. In addition to its potent effects on HSPC proliferation in demand situations, in the steady state, BCAP affects the GMP stage of myelopoiesis. BCAP2/2GMP cells appearmore primed formonocyte differentiation, given that theseGMP cells are enriched for IRF81 cells andLy6ChiCD115hiMPcells.19,41This correlateswithBCAP2/2mice having increased BM monocyte numbers at the steady state.

BLOOD, 16 MARCH 2017 x VOLUME 129, NUMBER 11 BCAP INHIBITS MYELOPOIESIS 1511 D ow nloaded from http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/129/11/1503/1399182/blood719823.pdf by guest on 21 January 2022 the demand-adapted situations we examined, suggesting that during emergency myelopoiesis, new monocyte and neutrophil production originates from earlier HSPC populations such as LSK or CMP cells. BCAPwas originally described to activate PI3Kby interactingwith the p85 subunit of PI3K upon phosphorylation of its 4YxxMmotifs.5,6 However, BCAP contains several protein-protein interaction domains, including ankyrin repeats, a Dof/BCAP/BANK domain, coiled-coil domains, proline-rich sequences, and a “cryptic-Toll-IL-1R domain.”5,10 Thus, BCAPmay interact with several signaling pathways in addition to PI3K. Preliminary studies examining signaling pathways within BCAP2/2HSPCs suggest that BCAP does not affect PI3K signaling during progenitor CFU assays, given that phosphorylation of the PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin target ribosomal protein S6 was not decreased in BCAP2/2 progenitor-derived cells (J.M.D. and J.A.H., unpublished observations). Additionally, lower PI3K activation, as would be predicted in BCAP2/2 HSPCs, would be expected to reduce, not promote, myeloid differentiation, given the positive role of PI3K in myelopoiesis.42,43 We also have not found a direct effect ofBCAP in regulatingproximalSTAT3activation downstream of IL-6 (J.M.D. and J.A.H., unpublished observations), an important cytokine in our in vitroCFUassays and in emergencymyelopoiesis in vivo.22,26,30,39,40 Therefore, identifying the signaling pathways that BCAP regulates to inhibit myeloid differentiation is of particular interest. Overall, we have identified BCAP as a novel negative regulator of myeloid cell development from hematopoietic progenitors. Defining novel regulators of emergency myelopoiesis is important tounderstanding this critical process, and for future efforts to therapeutically accelerate monocyte and neutrophil reconstitution following myeloablation after BM transplantation or chemotherapy.
