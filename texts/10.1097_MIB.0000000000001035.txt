Reuter, PhD,§ and Theresa T. Pizarro, PhD* Background: A large body of evidence supports a central role of TLR5 and its natural ligand, flagellin, in Crohn’s disease (CD), with the precise mechanism(s) still unresolved. Methods: We investigated the role of flagellin/TLR5 in SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice, a spontaneous model of Crohn’s disease-like ileitis. Results: Ileal Tlr5 and serum antiflagellin IgG antibodies were increased in SAMP before the onset of inflammation and during established disease; these trends were abrogated in the absence of colonizing commensal bacteria. Irradiated SAMP receiving either wild-type (AKR) or SAMP bone marrow (BM) developed severe ileitis and displayed increased ileal Tlr5 compared with AKR recipients of either SAMP or AKR bone marrow, neither of which conferred ileitis, suggesting that elevated TLR5 in native SAMP is derived primarily from a nonhematopoietic (e.g., epithelial) source. Indeed, ileal epithelial TLR5 in preinflamed SAMP was increased compared with age-matched AKR and germ-free SAMP. TLR5-specific ex vivo activation of SAMP ileal tissues decreased epithelial barrier resistance, indicative of increased permeability, and was accompanied by altered expression of the tight junction proteins, claudin-3, occludin, and zonula occludens-1. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that aberrant, elevated TLR5 expression is present in the ileal epithelium of SAMP mice, is augmented in the presence of the gut microbiome, and that TLR5 activation in response to bacterial flagellin results in a deficiency to maintain appropriate epithelial barrier integrity. Together, these findings represent a potential mechanistic pathway leading to the exacerbation and perpetuation of chronic gut inflammation in experimental ileitis and possibly, in patients with Crohn’s disease.

Commensal-derived flagellin has been identified as a dominant antigen in patients with CD,19 and about 50% of CD patients usually have abnormally high levels of antiflagellin antibodies that correlate with particular subtypes of severe disease.20,21 In animal studies, infusion of intrarectal flagellin worsens the severity of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis,22 and oral administration of Toxoplasma gondii induces a dramatic increase in the concentration of flagellin within the small intestine (in which flagellin is normally low), causing severe Th1-mediated ileitis.23 Together, these findings suggest an association of TLR5 with IBD, particularly CD, and that exposure of flagellin to either basolaterally-expressed TLR5 or subepithelial TLR5-expressing cells, in the setting of a damaged mucosal barrier, may have the ability to initiate and/or perpetuate chronic intestinal inflammation. Conversely, studies also document a downregulation of TLR5 in both animal models of colitis and patients with IBD.24,25 As such, the role of flagellin/TLR5 in the pathogenesis of IBD is controversial (i.e., pathogenic versus protective) and the cell types that express TLR5, as well as the TLR5-dependent mechanisms that regulate gut permeability and homeostasis in response to the gut microbiome, remain unclear. To gain more insight into how cell-specific expression and activation of TLR5 affects gut homeostasis and the potential development of chronic intestinal inflammation, we investigated the role of flagellin/TLR5 in ileitis-prone SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice. The SAMP mouse strain represents a chronic model of IBD and provides an excellent system to study the contributions made by specific cell types to the development of enteritis before the onset of inflammation, during the initiation and acute phase of inflammation, and when chronic disease is established.26 Additionally, since SAMP mice were derived from brother–sister mating of WT AKR mice (parental strain),27 the phenotype occurs spontaneously as in the human condition, without chemical, genetic, or immunologic manipulation. Inflammation is fully developed by 10 to 12 weeks of age,28 with Th1-type immune responses predominating early during the inductive phase,29,30 and a mixed Th1/Th2 phenotype emerging as ileitis develops into chronic, established disease.31,32 In the present study, we found that TLR5 in whole ileal tissues and serum anti-flagellin IgG antibody levels were increased in SAMP before the onset of inflammation and during established disease, when compared with age-matched AKR mice. These trends were abrogated in the absence of colonizing commensal bacteria. Construction of reciprocal bone marrow chimeras (BMCs) suggested that elevated levels of TLR5 in SAMP are derived from the nonhematopoietic compartment, which was confirmed in isolated IECs that expressed increased TLR5 mRNA and protein levels. In addition, TLR5-specific activation in ex vivo-stimulated SAMP ileal tissues markedly decreased epithelial barrier resistance and altered expression of the tight junction (TJ) proteins, claudin-3 (Cldn3), occludin (Occl) and zonula occludens-1, compared with AKR controls. Taken together, our data suggest that, in the presence of the gut microbiome, elevated epithelial TLR5 expression is inherent to SAMP mice, resulting in the inability to maintain barrier function in response to bacterial flagellin, and represents a potential mechanistic pathway leading to the susceptibility of CD-like ileitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice and Construction of BMCs SAMP and AKR mice were provided by the Mouse Models Core of the Cleveland Digestive Diseases Research Core Center and bred in the Animal Resource Center at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, fed standard laboratory chow (Harlan Teklad, Indianapolis, IN), and kept on 12-hour light/dark cycles. Original AKR were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). GF SAMP were maintained at Taconic Farms (Albany, NY) and shipped in GF vessels for sameor nextday experimentation. Equal numbers of age-matched male and female mice were used in each experimental group whenever possible, with neither gender overrepresented. BMCs were constructed from 10-week-old SAMP and AKR mice as previously described.33,34 At 6 weeks posttransplant, BMCs were treated with either broad spectrum ABXs (ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, all at 1 g/mL; vancomycin, 0.5 g/mL) or vehicle for an additional 4-week period,30 after which experimental mice were sacrificed. Histologic Evaluation of Intestinal Inflammation Distal 10 cm of ilea, or entire length of colon, from experimental mice were removed, flushed off fecal contents, opened longitudinally, and half of these tissues, further divided along the longitudinal axis, were placed in RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 48C for 24 hours, and stored at 2208C for later RNA extraction. The other half of the tissues were placed in Bouin’s fixative (Ricca Chemical Company, Arlington, TX) for histologic assessment. Briefly, fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, cut to 3 mm, and stained with H&E. Disease severity was evaluated by a trained gastrointestinal pathologist (J. R. Mize) in a blinded fashion, using established histologic scoring systems for ileitis28 and colitis.35 Images were obtained on an Axiophot microscope, captured on an Axiocam and assembled using Axiovision Release 4.5 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY).

In selected experiments, FliC (200 ng/mL) and conditioned media from BMDMs (described below) were preincubated with and without an anti-FliC monoclonal antibody (1:10 for 18 hours; Inotek Pharmaceuticals) before application onto SAMP ileal tissues. TEER readings were taken using an EVOM voltmeter with an EndOhm chamber attachment (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) immediately after assembling transwell apparatuses, and after 1 hour incubation at 378C. Baseline resistance readings were determined in transwells containing membrane inserts only and subtracted from sample values. IEC Isolation and Purification Freshly isolated ileal segments were chopped into 1-cm pieces and incubated in a solution containing DTT (Sigma) and EDTA (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). After a modification of the method described by Whitehead et al38 and as previously performed by our group,33,39,40 the specimens were then washed with 1· Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 15 mM Hepes, decanted, renewed with 10 mL of the 1· Hanks’ balanced salt solution/Hepes solution, and shaken vigorously for 15 seconds. Intestinal villi and crypts were collected and the process was repeated 3 times. Resulting IECs were washed 3· with 10 mL of Hanks’ balanced salt solution/Hepes solution and checked in prior and select experiments for purity, averaging 2% to 3% contamination of cells positive for CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), with no significant differences between mouse strains. Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) preps were then either cultured in complete media for 1 hour at 378C in the presence or absence of FliC (200 ng/mL), or immediately lysed in Buffer RLT (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) or in Pierce RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) containing 1· Halt Protease and Inhibitor Cocktail (Pierce), and stored at 2208C for later RNA isolation or Western blotting, respectively. ELISA-based Binding Assay for Measuring Mouse Serum Anti-flagellin IgG The 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 200 mL/well purified Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (1 mg/mL, Inotek Pharmaceuticals) brought up in coating buffer (#00-0000-12; eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA), and incubated overnight at 48C. Excess coating solution was subsequently decanted, and plate washed 5· with 300 mL/well washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4), after which 200 mL/well blocking buffer (5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) was added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After removal of blocking buffer, 200 mL/well of experimental mouse serum, diluted 1:500 (3% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS pH 7.4) was added and incubated overnight at 48C. Plates were then washed 5· with washing buffer, and 200 mL/well anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1000) was added, incubated at room temperature for 2 hours, and washed 3·. Finally, 200 mL of substrate was added to each well for 60 minutes at room temperature, after which plates were read at 450 nm on a standard ELISA plate reader. Results derived were converted from optical density to IgG concentration using an IgG standard curve with the formula of y ¼ Bmax · X (kd + X). Measurement of Luminal Bacterial Load Luminal bacterial load in native SAMP and AKR mice was determined by homogenizing full-thickness pieces of ilea and jejuna (50–100 mg) (including contents) in sterile PBS and plating homogenates onto blood agar plates (trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep’s blood; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in serial dilutions. Agar plates were incubated at 378C for 24 hours. Plates containing between 10 and 100 colony-forming units (CFUs) were evaluated to determine bacterial numbers, with data expressed as CFU/g tissue. Generation of Conditioned Media from BMderived Macrophages (BMDMs) Macrophages were derived from BM flushed from isolated femurs and tibia of SAMP and AKR mice, and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) containing penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 20% (vol/vol) L929 cell-conditioned medium at a density of 7.5 · 105 cells/cm2 at 378C in a 5% (vol/vol) CO2 atmosphere for 7 days. Twenty-four hours before use, cells were harvested and plated into 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 · 106/ well in 500 mL of culture medium described above. BMDMs were stimulated with 200 ng/mL FliC for 4 hours, and supernatants collected and immediately used for TEER assay (as described above). Total RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR Ileal/colonic tissues were recovered from RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Invitrogen), transferred to Matrix Lysing Tubes “D” (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) containing RLT Buffer (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen), and samples were homogenized in a Fast Prep 24 tissue homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). Total RNA from both tissue homogenates and isolated IEC preps was then isolated (RNeasy Mini Kits; Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed Lopetuso et al Inflamm Bowel Dis  Volume 23, Number 3, March 2017 394 | www.ibdjournal.org Copyright © 2017 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.

Reaction mixture consisted of 15% volume first-strand synthesis in a total volume of 20 mL that included Power SYBR Green core reagents (Applied Biosystems) and 500 nM final concentration of primers. Thermal cycling conditions were 958C/10 min followed by 40 cycles of 958C/15 s and 608C/1 min. Target mRNA transcripts were normalized to mHGPRT and analysis of relative gene expression data was calculated using the 22DDCT method.41 Data are reported as a relative fold-difference among groups within an experiment, with the control group set at arbitrarily as 1, as indicated in each figure legend. Western Blot Analysis Longitudinally-bisected sections from the distal 10 cm of ilea from experimental mice were placed in RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer containing 1· Halt Protease and Inhibitor Cocktail (all from Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and homogenized in a Fast Prep 24 tissue homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). Resulting ileal tissue homogenates as well as thawed IEC preparations (described above), were centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 20 min at 48C), supernatants collected, and total protein extracts quantified using a modification of the Bradford colorimetric procedure (Bio-Rad Protein Assay; BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Western blot analysis of total protein extracts was subsequently performed as described.39 Briefly, samples were mixed 1:1 with Laemmli buffer and equally loaded (25 mg of total protein per lane), after denaturation, on a 10.5% to 14% Tris$HCl Criterion precast gel (BioRad Laboratories). Samples were electrophoretically separated and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Blots were blocked in a 5% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline solution and incubated with specific anti-mouse primary antibodies: TLR5 IgG at a 1:800 dilution (clone EPR10373; Abcam), zonula occludens-1 and Occl IgG, both at a 1:100 dilution, Cldn3 IgG at a 1:100 dilution (all from Invitrogen), and b-actin IgG at a 1:5000 dilution (Abcam) overnight. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), either a polyclonal horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or an anti-goat IgG at a 1:1000 dilution (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as a secondary detecting antibody. Blots were then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting substrate (Pierce) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed on scanned X-ray films using the ImageJ Java-based image processing program (NIH open access). Arbitrary densitometric values for target proteins were normalized to those measured for b-actin for each sample, with background noise subtracted. Data are reported as relative fold-difference either between or among groups within an experiment, with a comparator group set at arbitrarily as 1, as indicated in each figure legend. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Selection of appropriate statistical tests was based on the variance and underlying distribution of data. Global effects between groups were first assessed using a one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Based on the results of the F-test, individual t-test comparisons were adjusted for unequal variance (Welch’s correction), as needed. For correlation analysis, the coefficient of determination (R2) was used as a measure for correlation. Results are expressed as mean 6 SEM and a probability of ,0.05 was considered significant. Ethical Considerations All procedures performed on experimental mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University and followed the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care guidelines. RESULTS TLR5 Is Expressed in Gut Tissues from Young, Uninflammed SAMP Mice and Is Increased During Established Disease Compared with AKR Controls To evaluate the contribution of the major cell surface sensors of bacteria/bacterial products in the pathogenesis of SAMP ileitis, Tlr2, Tlr4, and Tlr5 were measured in full thickness ileal and colonic tissues from SAMP mice at 4 weeks, before the onset of disease, and at 20 weeks, when ileitis is fully established (Fig. 1). Interestingly, Tlr5 was the most abundantly expressed TLR when compared with Tlr2 and Tlr4, and showed the greatest difference in magnitude versus age-matched AKR controls. During the preinflammatory state, Tlr5 was increased both in SAMP ilea (1.8-fold increase, P , 0.05) and colons (1.9-fold increase, P , 0.05) compared with age-matched AKRs, whereas no differences in Tlr2 and Tlr4 were found. In older SAMP with established disease, Tlr5 was markedly upregulated in tissues from the ilea (8.7-fold increase, P , 0.01) and colons (11.7-fold increase, P , 0.01) compared with age-matched AKR mice. During established disease, Tlr4 was also increased in colons (2.9-fold increase, P , 0.01), but not in ilea compared with controls. No significant differences were measured in Tlr2 in either the ilea or colons among all experimental groups (Fig. 1). These data show that TLR5 is one of the most abundantly expressed TLRs in the ilea and colons of young, uninflamed SAMP mice, and is potently Inflamm Bowel Dis  Volume 23, Number 3, March 2017 TLR5-dependent Barrier Dysfunction in Murine Ileitis www.ibdjournal.org | 395 Copyright © 2017 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.

IEC-derived TLR5 and Circulating Antiflagellin IgG Levels Are Increased Early During SAMP Ileitis, and Both Are Abrogated in the Absence of the Commensal Microflora Our previous studies showed that a primary epithelial barrier defect is present early in the small intestine of 3-week-old SAMP mice, before the onset of ileal inflammation, that likely drives ileitis and persists even in a GF setting.33 SAMP mice, however, still display ileal inflammation, albeit delayed and attenuated, when raised under GF conditions compared with age-matched SPF-raised SAMP,35 indicating that importance of the interaction(s) between the commensal microflora and the intestinal epithelium in this model. We therefore evaluated epithelial-derived TLR5 and the impact of the gut microbiome on TLR5 expression during SAMP ileitis. We first extended our prior findings and measured small intestinal epithelial permeability in 20-week-old SAMP raised in a GF environment and compared them with age-matched SAMP and AKR raised under SPF conditions. Experimental mice were given an orogastric gavage of a sugar probe cocktail 24 hours before urine collection and in vivo small intestinal epithelial permeability was measured by lactulose/mannitol FE, as previously described.36 SAMP mice raised for 20 weeks in a GF setting had similar lactulose to mannitol FE ratios compared with age-matched SAMP raised under SPF conditions (0.33 6 0.02 versus 0.34 6 0.02, n.s.), despite having approximately 50% severity of disease (7.73 6 1.53 versus 14.75 6 1.11, P , 0.01) (Fig. 2A, left panel). Elevated lactulose to mannitol FE ratios, however, were measured in both GFand SPF-raised SAMP relative to age-matched SPF AKR mice (0.19 6 0.02, both P , 0.0005 versus GF and SPF SAMP), and indicated increased small intestinal permeability in SAMP that is independent of gut bacterial colonization (Fig. 2A, B). Conversely, no differences were detected in the FE of sucralose, an indicator of colonic permeability,36 among the 3 aforementioned experimental groups (Fig. 2A, right panel), which all showed normal tissue morphology and no histologic signs of colitis, even at 20 weeks of age (Fig. 2A, B). Interestingly, in freshly isolated ileal IECs, Tlr5 was already markedly increased before the onset of inflammation in 4-week-old SPF SAMP compared with both age-matched SPF AKR (2.1-fold increase, P , 0.05) and GF SAMP (118.2-fold increase, P , 0.001) (Fig. 3A). These general trends were maintained during established disease with elevated Tlr5 IEC in 20-week-old SPF SAMP compared with age-matched SPF AKR (3.7-fold increase, P , 0.01) and GF SAMP (3.4-fold increase, P , 0.01) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, a high positive correlation was observed between the ratio of Tlr5 in SAMP/AKR ileal IEC and both age, as well as severity of ileitis (R2 ¼ 0.99) (Fig. 3B). At the protein level, similar results were observed, wherein Western blotting confirmed more abundant TLR5 protein in ileal IEC from pre-inflamed SAMP mice versus SAMP with established disease (67.3-fold increase) (see Fig. S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http:// links.lww.com/IBD/B453). Also similar to trends observed at the mRNA level, although TLR5 protein levels were greater in IEC from older (versus younger) mice independent of strain, TLR5 protein in ileal IEC from SAMP were markedly greater than their respective age-matched AKR controls (see Fig. S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/IBD/ B453). Importantly, circulating serum levels of anti-flagellin IgG were increased early, in 4-week-old SPF-raised SAMP compared with either age-matched SPF AKR or GF SAMP (1.98 6 0.45 versus 0.78 6 0.12 and 0.97 6 0.05 ng/mL, respectively; P , 0.01 and P , 0.05), whereas no difference in anti-flagellin IgG serum levels was measured between SPF AKR and GF SAMP (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data show that epithelial-derived TLR5 expression and circulating antiflagellin IgG levels are increased early during SAMP ileitis, and both are abrogated in the absence of colonizing gut bacteria. FIGURE 1. Tlr5 is increased in ilea and colons of young, uninflammed SAMP mice, and in older SAMP with established disease. mRNA transcripts of the major cell surface TLRs (i.e., TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5) were measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to Hgprt in full thickness ileal and colonic tissues from SAMP mice before the onset of disease (4 weeks of age) and during established ileitis (20 weeks of age), and compared with age-matched AKR controls. Results are expressed as relative mean 6 SEM (N $ 6/group), with the value for Tlr2 in 4-week-old AKR set arbitrarily as 1; **P , 0.01 versus TLR5 in age-matched AKRs.

SAMP mice that received AKR BM, but not AKR mice that received SAMP BM, were severely inflammed, with overt villous blunting and infiltration of acute and chronic inflammatory cells (Fig. 4B), validating our earlier studies that SAMP ileitis is dependent on the host’s nonhematopoietic compartment, and not donor BM.33 ABX treatment significantly reduced the severity of disease in AKR BM/SAMP and SAMP BM/SAMP mice compared with untreated controls (6.05 6 1.04 versus 18.00 6 0.00 and 7.37 6 1.10 versus 18.00 6 0.00 total inflammatory index, respectively; P , 0.001). Conversely, no histologic evidence of ileitis was assessed in both untreated and ABX-treated AKR/AKR, as well as ABX-treated SAMP BM/AKR mice (Fig. 4A, B). Similar to native SAMP mice, Tlr5 was markedly elevated in BM transplanted mice for which SAMP mice served as host recipients (AKR/SAMP and SAMP/SAMP) compared with controls (AKR/AKR, 11.3-fold increase, and SAMP/AKR, 22.3-fold increase, both P , 0.05, respectively). Also similar to native SAMP, no significant differences were observed in Tlr2 and Tlr4 among all experimental BMC groups (Fig. 4C). Finally, luminal bacterial load in the ilea and jejuna of 4week-old native SAMP and native AKR mice were measured (Fig. 4D). The number of bacterial CFUs was markedly increased in the ilea (by 3.8-fold), and to a lesser extent in the jejuna (by 2.7-fold), of SAMP compared with AKR mice (5.84 6 1.59 versus 1.54 6 0.42 and 0.52 6 0.09 versus 0.19 6 0.07 CFU · 108/g tissue, respectively; both P , 0.05). Overall, however, luminal bacterial load was significantly reduced in jejunal compared with ileal tissues independent of mouse strain (0.19 6 0.07 versus 1.54 6 0.42, by 87.7% in AKR and 0.52 6 0.09 versus 5.84 6 1.59 CFU · 108/g tissue in SAMP by 91.1%, P , 0.01 and P , 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that the mucosal surface of SAMP ilea is exposed to a greater bacterial load compared with AKR controls, early during the progression of ileitis, and that BMCs constructed with a pathogenic nonhematopoietic compartment (AKR/SAMP and SAMP/SAMP) display elevated Tlr5 and severe ileitis that is abrogated by ABX treatment.

Apical exposure of SAMP ilea to the TLR5 agonist, FliC (a subunit protein that polymerizes to form bacterial flagellin), but not to the TLR2 and 4 agonists, Pam3Cys and LPS, respectively, caused a further and substantial drop in TEER (232.871 6 7.272 V$cm2, P , 0.01 versus unstimulated control SAMP), whereas TEER measured across AKR ilea did not significantly change on exposure to the same TLR agonists under the same conditions (Fig. 5A), suggesting that specific attributes of SAMP ileal epithelium, or factors produced preferentially by SAMP ilea, induce an increase in epithelial permeability on TLR5 activation with FliC. Preincubation of FliC with an anti-FliC antibody before application onto 4-week-old SAMP ileal tissues led to abrogation of the FliC-dependent reduction in TEER (212.630 6 1.009 versus 217.99 6 1.440 V$cm2, P , 0.01) (Fig. 5B), indicating the specificity of TLR5-dependent activation in causing an increase in epithelial permeability. We next determined whether FliC has either a direct effect on SAMP epithelium or an indirect effect, through soluble factors produced by TLR5 activation of hematopoietic-derived cells within the ileal lamina propria that ultimately leads to increased epithelial permeability. Conditioned media from TLR5-expressing SAMP BMDMs stimulated with FliC and preincubated with and without anti-FliC did not alter TEER compared with unstimulated controls when subsequently applied, apically, to SAMP ileal tissues (28.250 6 1.731 and 27.350 6 2.067 versus 27.050 6 20.58 V$cm2, respectively; n.s.) (Fig. 5B), suggesting that TLR5 activation by FliC likely acts directly on SAMP ileal epithelium, inducing a reduction in TEER, indicative of increased epithelial permeability. Finally, TJ proteins in isolated IECs prepared from 4-weekold pre-inflamed SAMP and age-matched AKR ileal tissues after 1 hour culture in the absence or presence of FliC (therefore, measuring change in TJ protein mRNA expression) showed that Occl, and to a lesser extent Zo1 and Cldn3, markedly decreased in SAMP compared with AKR controls (81%, 67%, and 50% decrease, respectively, P , 0.05), whereas IEC derived from AKR mice did not show significant changes in TJ protein mRNA expression on TLR5 activation (Fig. 5C). Together, these data provide evidence that TLR5, but not TLR2 or TLR4, activation of SAMP ilea specifically induces increased epithelial permeability by directly acting on IEC and by differentially modulating epithelial TJ protein expression. DISCUSSION Increasing evidence supports a critical involvement of flagellin/TLR5 in the pathogenesis of IBD, especially in CD,19–21,24,25,42–44 but their exact roles remain controversial and the precise, downstream consequences of TLR5 activation in CD is currently unknown. Among bacterial antigens, flagellin is an interesting candidate to play a role in mucosal homeostasis and gut immune tolerance. Specifically, flagellin exists in significant quantities, originating from both the commensal flora as well as from pathogenic sources, and is a common bacterial antigen present on most motile bacteria in the gut.45 Though its size and FIGURE 5. Apical application of a TLR5, but not a TLR2 or TLR4, agonist to SAMP ileal tissues directly acts on IECs to increase epithelial paracellular permeability. Ileal tissues from 4-week-old, pre-inflamed SAMP were apically-stimulated ex vivo with the TLR5 agonist, FliC, for 1 hour after which change in TEER (D1h TEER) was measured to detect alterations in epithelial permeability (decrease in TEER indicates increased permeability).

Firstly, the luminal bacterial load was greater in the gut of SAMP compared with AKR, particularly in the ileum, and to a lesser extent in the jejunum, of young mice, facilitating early, increased exposure of bacteria and bacterial products to SAMP ilea. Although the precise etiology of this finding is unknown, several groups have reported marked goblet cell hyperplasia that results in abundant mucous production in SAMP and SAMP-related mouse strains,29,49–51 which can promote adherence and trapping of bacteria/bacterial products to the surface of the ileal mucosa and subsequent activation of epithelial-expressing TLRs. Secondly, similar to patients with IBD, elevated serum anti-flagellin IgG antibodies were measured in SAMP compared with AKR controls, which may be the end result of the inherent, primary small intestinal epithelial barrier defect characteristic of young SAMP mice33 that allows increased bacterial translocation across the epithelium, access to basolaterally-expressed TLR5 and initiation of proinflammatory innate immune response,15,22,52 and eventual generation of antibodies against bacterial components, including flagellin. Thirdly, and also similar to patients afflicted with CD, TLR5 expression was increased in SAMP ilea, both in the preinflammatory state, as well as during established disease versus age-matched AKRs, with TLR5 representing one of the most abundantly expressed TLR cell surface sensor in SAMP ilea. Interestingly, a significant positive correlation with a strong linear trend was calculated showing that the ratio of TLR5 expression in SAMP/AKR ilea increased as the mice aged and ileitis became more severe, indicating a clear involvement of TLR5 not only at the onset, but also in the potential worsening, of disease. In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that dysregulation of tolerance to intestinal TLR-stimulants and disruption of the epithelial barrier separating MAMPs from responsive, underlying tissues may contribute to the development or perpetuation of IBD.5 For example, although it is well established that the presence of luminal MAMPs is not sufficient to initiate IBDs in animal models,53–55 it has been shown that TLR-mediated detection of some luminal MAMPs can exacerbate existing disease.54–56 Moreover, although the healthy gut contains appreciable quantities of soluble ligands for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5, the relative abundance of stimulants within the gut microbiota for these receptors can increase dramatically during the course of experimental IBD.23 Our earlier studies, in fact, showed that the commensal bacterial flora, although not essential for the initiation of ileitis in the SAMP mouse strain, plays a paramount role in the progression and severity of gut inflammation characteristic of these mice.30,33,35 Specifically, the small intestinal permeability defect that precedes ileitis in these mice,33 as well as the ileitis phenotype itself, persists under GF conditions; however, the onset of disease is markedly delayed and the severity significantly dampened, lacking the proinflammatory Th2 immune component present in SPF-raised SAMP.31,32,35 In the present study, our results provide evidence that the commensal microbiota also drives the expression of TLR5 on ilea IECs. In fact, TLR5 was significantly decreased in IEC isolated from young GF mice compared with SPF SAMP, but even when compared with age-matched SPFraised AKR mice. In addition, serum anti-flagellin IgG levels were reduced in the absence of commensal bacteria in GF SAMP and were similar to levels in healthy AKR control mice. Our ex vivo experiments showed that, when activated, TLR5, but not TLR2 and TLR4, is able to cause a significant decrease in transepithelial resistance in ilea from young preinflammatory SAMP mice, and that blockade of TLR5 agonist activity can restore normal gut barrier resistance, confirming specificity of the TLR5-dependent increase in epithelial paracellular permeability. These effects seemed to act directly on SAMP ileal epithelium by modulation of steady state mRNA transcript levels of TJ proteins, including Occl and Zo1, and to a lesser extent Cldn3, which all decreased in response to flagellin when compared with age-matched AKR controls. Of note, no significant differences were observed in protein levels of the aforementioned TJ proteins after TLR5 activation (see Fig. S2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/IBD/B454). However, these measurements may simply reflect the relative brevity of the ex vivo TEER assay (1 h), during which changes in protein levels are not likely detected, whereas conformational changes in epithelial TJ protein complexes, leading to increased permeability, cannot be ruled out. These data, along with the observation that Tlr5 is markedly elevated in BMCs for which SAMP mice serve as host recipients, independent of donor BM, and that these same BMCs constructed from the nonhematopoietic compartment (e.g., epithelium) of SAMP mice develop severe ileitis, suggest that flagellin/TLR5 activation likely plays a proinflammatory, pathogenic role in SAMP CD-like ileitis. Although our data differ from previous work that indicates a primary protective role for flagellin/TLR5 activation in IBD,15,42,57 there are certainly important differences to consider, particularly when comparing SAMP mice with the TLR5 deficient (Tlr52/2) model. Aside from the inherent epithelial barrier defect, SAMP mice display multifactorial predisposing factors to CD-like ileitis, including a polygenic predisposition, innate and adaptive immune dysregulation, and localized susceptibility to the terminal ileum,26 which are features that closely resembles the human condition. By comparison, Tlr52/2 mice that develop spontaneous colitis were generated by deletion of a single gene (i.e., Tlr5) in otherwise healthy mice; a scenario that does not occur in the human setting, specifically in patients with IBD, who do not display either isolated or complete TLR5 loss-of-function. In addition, Tlr52/2 mice develop colitis versus the ileal-specific Inflamm Bowel Dis  Volume 23, Number 3, March 2017 TLR5-dependent Barrier Dysfunction in Murine Ileitis www.ibdjournal.org | 401 Copyright © 2017 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.

Since vast differences exist between the colon and the ileum, including but not restricted to, their general anatomy, various cellular components that make up their mucosal immune systems, the composition/load of the microflora, as well as the abundance and cellular localization of TLRs, the possibility exists that TLR5 activation may have very different, and even dichotomous, downstream effects in these 2 gut locations. In summary, our studies provide evidence that flagellin and TLR5 are important mediators in the pathogenesis of CD-like ileitis in SAMP mice. Although the small intestinal permeability defect characteristic of SAMP mice does not seem to depend on the expression of TLR5 and/or the presence of flagellin, ileal luminal bacterial load is markedly increased and upregulation of TLR5 occurs rapidly in the epithelium of young SAMP mice, before the onset of histologic evidence of ileal inflammation, and is dependent on colonization of the commensal flora. The permissive nature of the inherent epithelial barrier defect allows initial access of bacteria and bacterial products, including flagellin, to epithelial-expressed TLR5, whose basolateral localization has been well documented by several groups.15,22,58 Direct epithelial activation of TLR5 leads to dysregulated TJ protein expression and to further increased permeability, events that perpetuate bacterial/antigen translocation, as well as the initiation and amplification of inflammation. Although our results suggest that factors produced by TLR5-expressing macrophages after exposure to flagellin likely do not directly affect epithelial paracellular permeability, the possibility exists that these mediators have the ability to augment the inflammatory response through both innate and adaptive mucosal immune responses. For example, recent studies have shown that lamina propria dendritic cells have the ability to rapidly produce IL-2259 and IL2360 in response to bacterial flagellin, and may be important in promoting downstream Th17-mediated immune responses. Taken together, our data suggest a direct role of flagellin and TLR5 activation in promoting epithelial barrier dysfunction and propose a potential mechanistic pathway that contributes to the exacerbation and progression of experimental CD-like ileitis.
