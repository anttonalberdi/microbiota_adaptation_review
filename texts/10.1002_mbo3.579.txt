Therefore, the aim of the study was to find such a gene in available genomic sequences, suggest appropriate means and conditions for asmplification and sequencing of the desired region of the selected gene in various strains of the bacterial family and verify the importance in classification and phylogeny. Specific primers flanking the variable region (~800 pb) within the pyrG gene encoding the CTP synthetase were designed by means of gene sequences retrieved from the genomes of strains belonging to the family Bifidobacteriaceae. The functionality and specificity of the primers were subsequently tested on the wild (7) and type strains of bifidobacteria (36) and scardovia (7). Comparative and phylogenetic studies based on obtained sequences revealed actual significance in classification and phylogeny of the Bifidobacteriaceae family. Gene statistics (percentages of mean sequence similarities and identical sites, mean number of nucleotide differences, P and K distances) and phylogenetic analyses (congruence between tree topologies, percentages of bootstrap values >50 and 70%) indicate that the pyrG gene represents an alternative identification and phylogenetic marker exhibiting higher discriminatory power among strains, (sub)species, and genera than the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences of the particular gene fragment, simply achieved through specific primers, enable more precisely to classify and evaluate phylogeny of the family Bifidobacteriaceae including, with some exceptions, healthpromoting probiotic bacteria.

Very recently, the new genus Galliscardovia from the crop of a laying hen, new species Bifidobacterium apri from the digestive tract f wild pigs and Alloscardovia venturai from the oral cavity of a guineapig were described (Pechar et al., 2017b,c; Sechovcová et al., 2017). All members of the family have a specific activity of fructose 6phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) that distinguishes them from other bacteria (Bunesova, Vlkova, Rada, Killer, & Musilova, 2014; Killer et al., 2010). Nevertheless, F6PPK has very recently been proven in the order Coriobacteriales, thus saccharolytic bacteria inhabit a similar ecological niche to bifidobacteria. Horizontal transfer between Coriobacteriales and bifidobacteria was hypothesized (Gupta, Nanda, & Khadka, 2017). Bifidobacteria primarily inhabit the intestines of mammals. However, their presence was also proven in the oral cavity of mammals, human urinary tract and vaginal environment, the intestines of pollinators, digestive tract of poultry, raw and fermented mammalian milk, fermented milk products, and wastewater (Biavati & Mattarelli, 2012). Generally, bifidobacteria are considered to be nonpathogenic, probiotic microorganisms playing an irreplaceable role in antipathogenic activities, the stimulation/maturation of the immune system, development of intestinal microbiota, and enzyme activities associated with the digestion of indigestible food components (O’Callaghan & van Sinderen, 2016). Nevertheless, some bifidobacteria may participate in the formation of dental caries (Valdez et al., 2016) and urinary tract infection (Barberis et al., 2012). There are several case reports of bifidobacterial bacteremia in preterm infants and immunocompromised individuals (Avcin, Pokorn, Kitanovski, Premru, & Jazbec, 2015; Weber et al., 2015). Representatives of the scardovial genera differ from bifidobacteria based on genotypic, phenotypic characteristics, and habitat (Killer et al., 2013a). In most cases, they are adapted to an oxygencontaining environment. They were found to be present in the human and animal oral cavity, human clinical samples, urinary tract, porcine cecum, and intestinal tract of wild pigs (Downes et al., 2011; Huys et al., 2007; Killer, Havlik, Bunesova, Vlkova, & Benada, 2014; Simpson, Ross, Fitzgerald, & Stanton, 2004). In contrast to bifidobacteria, scardovia inhabiting the human body are presented as opportunistic pathogens causing oral diseases and urinary tract infection (Mahlen & Clarridge, 2009; Tanner et al., 2011). The classification and phylogenetic studies of bifidobacteria were based on the determination of carbohydrate fermentation patterns, enzyme activities, morphological and physiological characteristics, peptidoglycan type, DNA G + C content, DNADNA relatedness, and 16S rRNA gene sequences by the end of the last century (Dong, Xin, Jian, Liu, & Ling, 2000; Scardovi, Trovatelli, Biavati, & Zani, 1979). Even though all of the above classification techniques, and especially the latter two, are still in use for the differentiation of taxonomic units and primary evaluation of phylogeny (Mattarelli et al., 2014), they have been reported to have several shortcomings. Biochemical and physiological characteristics can be similar among the strains of separated species and, on the other hand, vary among strains of the same species. The results of DNA G + C determination using traditional methods may differ from laboratory to laboratory, depending on the technique used (Fournier, Suhre, Fournous, & Raoult, 2006). DNADNA heteroduplexes are formed between strands having at least 80% sequence complementarity. For this reason, DNA reassociation values may not replace the comparison of wholegenome sequences and gene content differences (Lugli et al., 2014). Phylogeny, classification, and ecological studies on bifidobacteria based on the 16S rRNA gene can be misleading due to the presence of different copies in genomes (Satokari, Vaughan, Akkermans, Saarela, & de Vos, 2001; Větrovský & Baldrian, 2013; Wu, Jospin, & Eisen, 2013). Moreover, there are examples of bifidobacterial species sharing very similar 16S rRNA gene sequences (Delcenserie et al., 2007; Lugli et al., 2014). The application of variable regions within housekeeping genes belonging to COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes/Groups of proteins) family in the phylogeny of bifidobacteria is considered to be an alternative to 16S rRNAderived phylogeny (Jian, Zhu, & Dong, 2001; Killer, Sedláček, Rada, Havlík, & Kopečný, 2013b; Ventura et al., 2006). A phylogenetic/identification marker applicable to almost the entire Bifidobacteriaceae family has not been devised yet. This led us to find a candidate gene in the genomes of representatives of the family with more robust discriminatory power among taxonomic units and comparable or better phylogenetic features than the 16S rRNA gene. The gene encoding the CTP (cytidine triphosphate) synthase (catalyzing the ATPdependent amination of UTP to CTP with either lglutamine or ammonia as the source of nitrogen), which plays an irreplaceable role in the synthesis of RNA in the process of transcription seems to be an appropriate candidate. It is ubiquitous in bacteria, homologous, exists in a single copy in the genome, is subject to stabilizing selection, stable with respect to rapid genetic modification and able to produce a robust phylogenetic tree that reflects the evolution of the species as much as possible (Glaeser & Kämpfer, 2015; Wu et al., 2013). Below, we discuss the applicability of the variable region within the pyrG gene encoding the CTP synthase in the differentiation of taxonomic units and phylogenetic assessment of the Bifidobacteriaceae family compared with the 16S rRNA gene. 2  | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Strains, culture conditions, and DNA extraction Fortythree type strains of the Bifidobacteriaceae family and seven wild strains of bifidobacteria (Table 1) of human and animal origin were used in the study. Type strains were purchased from the DSMZ (Leibniz Institute DSMZ – German Collection of Microorganisms and      |  3 of 11KILLER Et aL. Cell Cultures). Sequences of the strain B. thermophilum JCM 1207T were also included in the study because results of our recently accepted study (Pechar, Killer, Mekadim, Geigerová, & Rada, 2017a) confirmed a significant genetic difference between the strain and B. thermophilum DSM 20210T. Thus, we wanted to find out whether these two strains, both referred to as type, also differ based on the sequences of the given gene. All strains (except of B. thermophilum JCM 1207T) were routinely cultivated in anaerobic TPY broth (Scardovi, 1986) at 37°C for 24 h. Genomic DNA was extracted for PCR purposes from 1 ml of vital cultures using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer′s instructions for grampositive bacteria. 2.2 | Isolation and identification of wild strains of bifidobacteria Seven strains of bifidobacteria originating from the feces of infants and calves (Table S1) were isolated from colonies grown in modified TPY agar (Rada & Petr, 2000) under conditions previously reported (Killer et al., 2013a). They were then identified based on 16S TABLE  1 Strains used in this study with NCBI numbers of 16S rRNA and pyrG genes Strain 16S rRNA gene NCBI numbers pyrG gene NCBI numbers Aeriscardovia aeriphila DSM 22365T NR042759 KT351222 Alloscardovia omnicolens DSM 21503T AM419460 KT351223 Alloscardovia criceti DSM 17774T NR041347 KT351224 Parascardovia denticolens DSM 10105T D89331 KT351225 Pseudoscardovia suis DSM 24744T NR118047 KT351226 Pseudoscardovia radai DSM 24742T HQ842704 KT351227 Scardovia inopinata DSM 10107T NR112093 KT351228 Bifidobacterium adolescentis DSM 20083T NC008618 KY365559 B. adolescentis VBES42 KY705017 KY746715 B. angulatum DSM 20098T D86182 KT351229 B. animalis subsp. animalis DSM 20104T NZJGYM01000004 KT351230 B. animalis subsp. lactis DSM 10140T CP001606 NC012815 B. asteroides DSM 20089T LC071851 KT351231 B. biavatii DSM 23969T NZJGYN01000007 KT351232 B. bifidum DSM 20456T NZJGYO01000002 KY365560 B. bifidum VBMA1 KY705018 KY746716 B. bohemicum DSM 22767T NZJGYP01000004 KT351233 B. bombi DSM 19703T NR104872 KT351234 B. boum DSM 20432T NZJGYQ01000004 KT351235 B. breve DSM 20213T AB006658 KT351236 B. breve VBTA1 KY705019 KY746717 B. callitrichos DSM 23973T NZJGYS01000032 KT351237 B. catenulatum VBJ50 KY705020 KY746718 B. coryneforme DSM 20216T NZCP007287 KT351238 B. crudilactis LMG 23609T NZJHAL01000001 KT351239 B. dentium DSM 20436T AP012326 KT351240 B. gallinarum DSM 20670T D86191 KT351241 B. choerinum DSM 20434T NZJGYU01000002 KT351242 B. indicum DSM 20214T NR043439 KT351243 B. kashiwanohense DSM 21854T NR112779 KT351244 B. longum subsp. infantis DSM 20088T AP010889 KT351245 B. longum subsp. longum DSM 20219T AP010888 KT351246 B. longum subsp. suis DSM 20211T NZJGZA01000002 KT351247 Strain 16S rRNA gene NCBI numbers pyrG gene NCBI numbers B. longum subsp. suis VB5/9 KY705021 KY746719 B. merycicum DSM 6492T NZJGZC01000002 KT351248 B. minimum DSM 20102T NZJGZD01000001 KT351249 B. pseudocatenulatum DSM 20438T D86187 KT351250 B. pseudocatenulatum VBMA7 KY705022 KY746720 B. pseudolongum subsp. globosum DSM 20092T D86194 KT351251 B. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum DSM 20099T D86195 KT351252 B. psychraerophilum DSM 22366T NZJGZI01000007 KT351253 B. saguini DSM 23967T NZJGZN01000001 KT351254 B. scardovii DSM 13734T NZJGZO01000008 KT351255 B. stellenboschense DSM 23968T NZJGZP01000012 KT351256 B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum DSM 17755T AY148470 KT351257 B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum VBT15 KY705023 KY746721 B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum DSM 15837T NZJDTO01000023 KT351258 B. thermophilum DSM 20210T NZJDUB01000036 KT351259 B. thermophilum JCM 1207T NZJGZV01000001 NZJGZV0 1000002 B. tsurumiense DSM 17777T NZJGZU01000004 KT351260 T, type strain.

The sequencing of almost complete 16S rRNA genes and the others in the study was performed by the company SEQme (CZ) on the basis of both primers. Complete sequences derived from forward and reverse primers were then stacked in the program Geneious v7.1.7 (Biomatters Ltd.) and stored in the GenBank database of the NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information) through the application Banklt. The EzBioCloud database (Yoon et al., 2017) was used to find the closest related taxa. 2.3 | Designing primers flanking the variable region of the pyrG gene To design primers for the amplification and sequencing of the pyrG gene region of the family Bifidobacteriaceae, the corresponding sequences derived from the complete genome sequences belonging to 15 representatives of the family were applied (Table S2). The sequences were aligned using the Alignment tool in Geneious, which also automatically determined the direction to acquire the consensus sequence. This was used to design primers defining a variable fragment of the particular gene using the application Primer3 in the same software. In order to increase the specificity and functionality of the primers, PCR parameters such as the range of primer size, melting temperature (Tm), % GC, and then maximum Tm difference, maximum dimer Tm, maximum 3′ stability and GC clamp were properly set (Untergasser et al., 2012). The following primers covering a 798bp fragment (corresponding to the position 894819–895616 within the complete genome of Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703T; NCBI accession number AP009256) were proposed: BifcPyrGF (5′ BCAYATCACCAACGARATYAA3′) and BifcPyrGR (5′AYTCRATGACCATGGACTGCA3′). To be applicable to the widest range of different species of the Bifidobacteriaceae family, primers were manually corrected at some positions. 2.4 | PCR amplification, sequencing, and deposition in the GenBank database The pyrG gene fragment in representatives of the family Bifidobacteriaceae was amplified in a 25 μl PCR mixture composed of 1× PPP Master Mix (TopBio, CZ; 75 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 8.8, 20 mmol/L (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 μmol/L of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1.25 U Taq purple DNA polymerase), 0.2 μmol/L of each primer, and 10–100 ng of template DNA. The optimal PCR amplification program determined using the TProfessional Gradient 96 thermocycler (Biometra, Germany) was as follows: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 6 min, 32 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 50 s, annealing at 53°C for 55 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min; the amplification finished with a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were analyzed in the presence of DNA marker 200–1,500 (TopBio, CZ) on 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) to ensure that a fragment of the correct size had been amplified. Electrophoresis was performed at 115 V for 40 min. Checked amplicons were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced with the corresponding primers by SEQme (CZ). Final sequences derived from forward and reverse primers were constructed in Geneious. Sequencing of the particular gene fragment was verified using the nucleotide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) application that is part of the NCBI database containing all available genome and gene sequences. The assembled sequences were deposited after checking and editing in the GenBank database with the application Banklt. 2.5 | Determination of gene characteristics The alignment of sequences was carried out using the ClustalW algorithm in the program BioEdit v7.2.6 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/ BioEdit/page2.html). The partial pyrG and also 16S rRNA gene sequences were applied. The latter were retrieved for type strains from complete genomes (the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers are shown in Table 1). The 16S rRNA gene, generally considered to be a standard identification and phylogenetic marker in prokaryotes, was applied as a comparative baseline to verify whether the pyrG gene represents an appropriate molecular marker for the Bifidobacteriaceae family. The resulting alignment was subjected to the removal of hypervariable positions using the Gblocks algorithm with the default setting (Castresana, 2000). The percentages of mean pairwise identities, pairwise distances, identical sites, and CG contents were computed in Geneious v7.1.7 (Biomatters Ltd.). The other gene parameters, consisting of the mean number of nucleotide differences, P distance (number of base substitution per site), K distance, number of conserved and variable sites, number of parsimoniousinformative, and singleton variable sites were calculated in the software package MEGA v5.05 (Tamura et al., 2011). The latter four parameters were applied to the pyrG gene and aminoacid sequences that were generated using the toggle translation tool in the program BioEdit. The program DnaSP v5 (Librado & Rozas, 2009) was used for calculation the number of synonymous sites (substitution in the coding region that causes no amino acid changes), nonsynonymous sites (substitution in the coding region that causes amino acid changes), nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous site (dN), synonymous changes per synonymous site (dS), and the ratio of dN/dS in the pyrG region. 2.6 | Phylogenetic analyses The bestfit ML (Maximum Likelihood) evolutionary model for 16S rRNA and pyrG gene (and aminoacid) datasets was determined in MEGA v5.05. The resulting models were then used for the phylogenetic tree in the same software. Bootstrap values were calculated after 1,000 replicates to estimate the reliability of the phylogenetic groups and clusters. To test the incongruence length difference (ILD) between the 16S rRNA and pyrG tree topologies (p = .05), the BioNJ congruence analysis implemented in the software MLSTest (Tomasini, Lauthier, Llewellyn,      |  5 of 11KILLER Et aL. & Diosque, 2013) was performed. The Templeton test, as a part of the NJ localized incongruence difference analysis in the same software, was also carried out. It analyses incongruence node by node in the topology of concatenated loci. A p value lower than .05 in a branch suggests that at least one locus is incongruent with the tested node. 2.7 | Testing of recombination Potential recombination events in the partial pyrG gene sequences of examined Bifidobacteriaceae strains were scanned using the automated RDP analysis (Martin & Rybicki, 2000) in the program RDP4 v4.67 (Martin et al., 2010). 3  | RESULTS 3.1 | Comparison of 16S rRNA and pyrG gene characteristics and statistics The pyrG (length of 798 pb) gene fragment was amplified and sequenced in Bifidobacteriaceae strains under the conditions described above. The assigned GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers of the gene fragment and 16S rRNA gene sequences are listed in Table 1. Basic gene parameters calculated in bifidobacteria, scardovia, and the whole Bifidobacteriaceae family are shown in Table 2. The stretch of pyrG gene fragment examined did not contain any indels in bifidobacterial species. Only five insertions and deletions in a short region Parameter Bifidobacteria Scardovia f.

Although the 16S rRNA gene alignments covered a much longer segment, the shorter pyrG gene region exhibited a much higher sequence variability among representatives of the investigated family. This is documented by lower percentages of mean pairwise identities, identical sites and, on the other hand, higher values of mean number of nucleotide differences, Pand Kdistances. As expected, the highest sequence variability was found among the scardovial species (Table 2). A lower content of CG was calculated in scardovia for both genes. Percentages of pyrG gene pairwise distances among all strains tested are presented in Table S3. In scardovial species, the lowest and highest values were computed between Aeriscardovia aeriphila Alloscardovia criceti (66.29%) and Pseudoscardovia suisPseudoscardovia radai (89.69%), respectively. In terms of bifidobacterial species, the highest and lowest distances were determined between B. indicum-B. saguini (74.72%) and B. catenulatum VBJ50B. kashiwanohense, B. kashiwanohenseB. pseudocatenulatum (both pairs 98.11%), respectively. Basic pyrG gene statistics revealed a higher number of variable and nonsynonymous sites than conserved and synonymous sites in the whole family and in scardovia. The opposite was found for amino acid sequences (Table 3). The ratio of dN/dS < 1 (0.12–0.23 in bifidobacteria, scardovia and the whole Bifidobacteriaceae family) indicates that most of the sequence variability can be explained by purifying (stabilizing) selection and slow evolution. 3.2 | Classification of wild strains of bifidobacteria The classification of seven wild strains of bifidobacteria through 16S rRNA and pyrG gene comparative analysis is documented in Table S1. The strains originating from infant feces were classified as B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, and B. pseudocatenulatum, whereas those from the feces of calves as B. longum subsp. suis and B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum. In all these strains (except for B. catenulatum), better differentiation from type strains was found using the pyrG gene than with the 16S rRNA gene sequences. 3.3 | Phylogenetic analyses The phylogeny of the family Bifidobacteriaceae reconstructed based on 16S rRNA and pyrG gene sequences is presented in Figure 1. The maximumlikelihood algorithm and the bestfit ML evolutionary model (Table 2) were applied. The 16S rRNAderived phylogenetic tree, created primarily by sequences found in complete genomes to make the topology as accurate as possible, includes a separated scardovial cluster and B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. boum, B. longum, and B. pseudolongum phylogenetic groups (Figure 1a). The same phylogenetic groups, plus a cluster including species of bifidobacteria isolated from important pollinators (honeybees and bumblebees) are visible in the pyrG phylogenetic tree (Figure 1b). The higher confidence, more accurate topology and robustness of pyrGbased phylogeny are documented by higher percentages of bootstrap values >50 and >70 (Table 2). The much higher discriminatory power among Bifidobacteriaceae species in the pyrGderived phylogeny is shown by the length of branches and the scale referring to substitutions per nucleotide position. A comparative analysis revealing the degree of differentiation of bifidobacterial subspecies based on 16S rRNA and pyrG gene sequences was also performed. A higher resolution was determined in the pyrG gene sequences, as shown in Table S4. The phylogeny based on pyrG genederived aminoacids (265 aa) sequences revealed a separated cluster of scardovia, then the B. boum and B. pseudolongum phylogenetic groups and a cluster including Bifidobacterium species from pollinators (Figure S2). The phylogenetic groups of B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, and B. longum are placed together in the supercluster. As expected, the ILD testing between the 16S rRNA and pyrG trees (p = .01) revealed a length incongruence, and the topology of the concatenated loci should be considered carefully. Understandably, coding and noncoding genes should not be combined. Nevertheless, we also performed the NJ localized incongruence difference analysis based on the Templeton test just to find out if the topologies of 16S rRNA and pyrGbased phylogenetic trees are in (in)congruence. The phylogenetic tree showing node by node statistical values revealing whether at least one gene is (in)congruent with the tested node is presented in Figure S3.

Maximumlikelihood statistical method and AIC best fit ML model (Table 2) implemented in MEGA v5.05 software were applied. Phylogeny was improved by bootstrapping (1,000 datasets). Bootstrap percentages (>50) are given at nodes. Trees were rooted by Cutibacterium acnes subsp. acnes ATCC 6919T (for 16S rRNAderived phylogeny, GenBank accession number AB042288), DSM 1897T (for pyrGderived phylogeny, NZAWZZ01000003). Bars refer to substitutions per nucleotide position (a) (b) 8 of 11  |     KILLER Et aL. et al., 2013). Therefore, this gene encoding a protein implicated in nucleotide metabolism seems to be an appropriate candidate for a molecular marker usable in the identification, classification, typing, and phylogeny of bacteria. It was applied in various taxonomic groups of bacteria, for example, in the genus Borrelia, Edwardsiella, order Xanthomodales, various Lactobacillus species and for assessing microbial diversity in ecosystems (Abayneh, Colquhoun, & Sørum, 2012; Diancourt et al., 2007; Naushad & Gupta, 2013; Roux et al., 2011; Rudenko, Golovchenko, Belfiore, Grubhoffer, & Oliver, 2014; SarmientoRubiano et al., 2010). Average nucleotide identity of pyrG gene sequences (Table 2) calculated in bifidobacteria (84.4%) and the whole family (81.7%) is to some extent similar to that calculated among species of bifidobacteria based on clpC (81.35%), hsp60 (85.0%), and rpoC (88.25%) gene sequences (Jian et al., 2001; Ventura et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it is important to note that shorter gene segments (540–690 nt) and a lower number of Bifidobacterium species were considered. A lower content of CG determined in scardovia for both genes is consistent with previous findings based on the values of this parameter in genomic DNA (Killer et al., 2010, 2013a). The average GC composition of the pyrG gene calculated in all strains tested (62.0%) is typical for bacteria belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum (Delétoile et al., 2010). The calculated ratio of dN/dS < 1 on the basis of pyrG gene sequences among Bifidobacteriaceae strains tested (Table 3) suggesting stabilizing selection and slow evolution together with no detection of recombination events allow the particular gene to be considered a suitable molecular marker (Glaeser & Kämpfer, 2015; Nuñez et al., 2014). Genes that are not prone to horizontal transmission and recombination meet one of the basic requirements for their use as identification and phylogenetic markers (Adékambi et al., 2011; Roux et al., 2011). It is necessary to point out that mainly type strains (with the exceptions of seven strains) were employed and thus intraspecies recombinations may not be ruled out. Individual phylogenetic groups are better defined based on pyrG gene sequences in the contrast to the 16S rRNAderived phylogeny and the topology of the phylogenetic tree more accurately reflects those observed in phylogenetic studies of the genus Bifidobacterium and the Bifidobacteriaceae family on the basis of wholegenomic assays (Lugli et al., 2014; Milani et al., 2014, 2015; Sun et al., 2015; Zhang, Gao, Adeolu, Khadka, & Gupta, 2016). Within these studies, the B. pullorum phylogenetic group was also mentioned. This group is missing in our study, because some species classified into the phylogenetic group (B. pullorum and B. saeculare) were not included in this study. Some discrepancies were found in the B. longum and B. bifidum phylogenetic groups in the pyrGbased phylogeny compared with wholegenomic phylogenies. Species B. angulatum and B. merycicum belong to the B. longum phylogenetic group, whereas these species are positioned in the B. adolescentis group based on the pyrG phylogenetic study (Figure 1b). The species B. callitrichos and B. stellenboschense clustered with the B. bifidum group near the B. longum group. However, these species are classified into the B. longum group using the wholegenomic analyses (Lugli et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). As illustrated in both trees (Figure 1a,b), strains B. thermophilum JCM 1207T and B. thermophilum DSM 20210T differ from each other. Strain B. thermophilum JCM 1207T seems to be more related to B. boum type strain. Besides, Lugli et al. (2014) came to a similar conclusion. We therefore believe that the strain B. thermophilum DSM 20210T should be considered a realtype strain of a given species. Classification and phylogenetic position of wild strains of bifidobacteria using pyrG gene sequences correlated with those found on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Table S1, Figure 1a,b). This allows to consider the pyrG gene as an appropriate, easily accessible identification tool for isolates of bifidobacteria of different origin. All phylogenetic branches and nodes reconstructed based on the concatenation of 16S rRNA and pyrG gene sequences using the Templeton test implemented in NJ localized incongruence difference analysis are congruent (Figure S3). This indicates that the pyrG gene can be used as an alternative phylogenetic marker of the 16S rRNA gene in the Bifidobacteriaceae family. Remarkably, the robustness and topology of the tree encompassing particular taxonomic groups correspond to a large extent to the phylogenomic analyses of the family (Lugli et al., 2017), although 16S rRNA and a coding housekeeping genephylogeny should not usually be applied together. Although the application of a single gene fragment for classification and phylogenetic purposes in particular taxonomic groups of bacteria may in many ways be confusing and inaccurate, the results presented above provide evidence that the pyrG gene may be used in the family Bifidobacteriaceae as an alternative classification and phylogenetic marker to the 16S rRNA gene. In contrast to the phylogenetic marker used as the ‘gold standard’ in the phylogeny of prokaryotes, the higher degree of sequence divergence of the pyrG gene at the (sub)species level (Table S4) is superior for identification purposes. The gene is expected to be applicable for the classification of new Bifidobacteriaceae taxa and MLSA (MultiLocus Sequence Analysis). In the future, the application of larger numbers of strains of a given species should confirm or refute the integration of this gene into MLST (Multilocus sequence typing) analyses.
