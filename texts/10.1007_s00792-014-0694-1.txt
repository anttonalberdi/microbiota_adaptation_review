"ORIGINAL PAPER Comparison of Artemia–bacteria associations in brines, laboratory cultures and the gut environment: a study based on Chilean hypersaline environments Mauricio Quiroz • Xavier Triadó-Margarit • Emilio O. Casamayor • Gonzalo Gajardo Received: 20 May 2014 / Accepted: 28 August 2014 / Published online: 20 September 2014  Springer Japan 2014 Abstract The brine shrimp Artemia (Crustacea) and a diversity of halophilic microorganisms coexist in natural brines, salterns and laboratory cultures; part of such environmental microbial diversity is represented in the gut of Artemia individuals. Bacterial diversity in these environments was assessed by 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting. Eight natural locations in Chile, where A. franciscana or A. persimilis occur, were sampled for analysis of free-living and gutassociated bacteria in water from nature and laboratory cultures. The highest ecological diversity (Shannon’s index, H’) was found in brines, it decreased in the gut of wild and laboratory animals, and in laboratory water. Significant differences in H’ existed between brines and laboratory water, and between brines and gut of wild animals. The greatest similarity of bacterial community composition was between brines and the gut of field animals, suggesting a transient state of the gut microbiota. Sequences retrieved from DGGE patterns (n = 83) exhibited an average of 97.8 % identity with 41 bacterial genera from the phyla Proteobacteria (55.4 % of sequences match), Bacteroidetes (22.9 %), Actinobacteria (16.9 %) and Firmicutes (4.8 %). Environment-exclusive genera distribution was seen in Sphingomonas and Paenibacillus (gut of field animals), Amaricoccus and Ornithinimicrobium (gut of laboratory animals), and Hydrogenophaga (water of laboratory cultures). The reported ecological and physiological capabilities of such bacteria can help to understand Artemia adaptation to natural and laboratory conditions. Keywords Artemia  Bacteria  16S rRNA gene  Ecological diversity  Salty lakes  Salterns  Chile Introduction Hypersaline lakes are inland-like ecosystems scattered over tropical and subtropical areas with high rates of evaporation (Van Stappen 2002). Their unique ecological characteristics, stemming from high salt concentration, anoxia and salinity fluctuation, high exposure to UV radiation, and wide variation in water temperature and ionic composition (Castro et al. 2006), make them extreme and unique ecosystems for the survival of aquatic species (Wharton 2007). Not surprisingly, the brine shrimp Artemia is the sole animal adapted to such conditions (Gajardo and Beardmore 2012), though the organism coexists with a diversity of viruses, bacteria, Archaea and fungi (Benlloch et al. 2002; Zafrilla et al. 2010; Ghai et al. 2011; Riddle et al. 2013). In the context of host-adapted bacteria relationships (Toft and Andersson 2010), the Artemia–bacteria historical coexistence presuppose some kind of functional relationship, for example bacteria being part of the Artemia food web, Communicated by A.

It is now known that besides microalgae and detritus (Savage and Knott 1998), Artemia also feed on bacteria as demonstrated by laboratory experiments under algae-limited and high bacteria biomass conditions (Marques et al. 2005; Toi et al. 2013). In spite of this functional relationship, studies on Artemia and halophilic bacteria have followed independent tracks, with some recent exceptions (Riddle et al. 2013). On one hand, Artemia as a model extremophile for studies of evolution and adaptation owing to the particular life cycle evolved to cope with harsh environmental conditions (Clegg and Trotman 2002; Gajardo et al. 2002; Gajardo and Beardmore 2012), which includes the ability of females to switch offspring between highly resistant cysts (diapause embryos) and free-swimming nauplii, in response to stressful or stable conditions, respectively. Cysts are highly demanded in the aquaculture market as upon hatching they release nauplii that are extremely valuable as live diet for the larviculture of marine fish (Dhont and Sorgeloos 2002). On the other hand, hypersaline lakes are reservoirs of high microbial genetic diversity (Casamayor et al. 2002; Demergasso et al. 2004; Dorador et al. 2009; Casamayor et al. 2013; Triadó-Margarit and Casamayor 2013) likely to be the source of novel variants of biotechnological importance, owing to the peculiarities of salty lakes. The recognition that microorganisms are ubiquitous to almost every environment, and able to establish different types of association, such as mutualism or parasitism (Fraune and Bosch 2010; Toft and Andersson 2010), led us to assume they should affect Artemia fitness (survival and reproduction) both in nature and the laboratory environment. The non-selective filter feeder condition of Artemia offers chances for microbial communities of salty lakes to be represented in the gut microbiota, thus helping Artemia to digest microalgae by providing important enzymes which also assist marine fish larvae feeding on Artemia nauplii, to take-up and digest nutrients (Gorospe et al. 1996; Orozco-Medina et al. 2002; Seoka et al. 2007; Nayak 2010; Tkavc et al. 2011). The microbiota also boosts immunological response and more complex reproductive phenotypes like courtship, as shown for other invertebrates (Sharon et al. 2010). The purpose of this research was to assess bacterial diversity in the natural environment, hypersaline lakes (brines) and man-made coastal solar salterns, the laboratory environment—water of Artemia cultures—and in the Artemia gut environment (microbiota) of field and cultured animals. The study was based on water samples and individuals collected from salty lagoons scattered in salt flats of northern Chile (Atacama Desert) (Gajardo and Beardmore 1993; Gajardo et al. 2002; Demergasso et al. 2004; Dorador et al. 2009; Stivaletta et al. 2011), salterns in central Chile which are artificial Artemia environments, and salty lagoons in southern latitudes (Patagonia) (Clegg and Gajardo 2009). Specific Artemia–bacteria association is assumed depending on the environment evaluated owing to the differential selective pressures bacteria encounter. Knowing the functional abilities of bacterial types adapted to each condition should provide insights on the functionality of such association. The natural sites assessed contain the New World Artemia species, A. franciscana (distributed from 21 to 24 latitude South) and A. persimilis (50–54S), which add the species dimension to the study (Gajardo et al. 2002). In solar salterns (34.5–35.0S) located in between atypical A. franciscana individuals have been described (Mura and Gajardo 2011). This is the southern edge of the species distribution in the Americas. Materials and methods Origin of samples Water samples and Artemia individuals were collected from eight natural locations in Chile, three salty lagoons in the north, two salterns in the center, and three lagoons in Patagonia, southern Chile (Table 1). These samples allowed comparisons between the following three types of environments: (a) field, water (brine) samples from natural locations (F_W); (b) laboratory, water samples (L_W) from laboratory-reared Artemia cultures; (c) gut, corresponds to the microbiota assessed in the digestive tube of wild (F_G) and laboratory-reared animals (L_G). Laboratory cultures were established from wild Artemia animals collected from each location, except for Laguna de los Cisnes (LAC) where only cysts were available at sampling, as explained below. For Laguna de la sal (LDS) only water samples (brine) were available for analysis since Artemia individuals did not survive under captivity. Adult and juveniles collected in nature were acclimatized to laboratory conditions in 5 L aquaria filled with water from the site which was then slowly replaced by artificial seawater (35 ppt), made according to Kalle (1971, p 687). Animals were fed either Dunaliella tertiolecta or Isochrysis galbana (1.2 9 106 cells mL-1 per individual) every 2 days, according to Gajardo and Beardmore (1993). The LAC’s laboratory population was the only one started from cysts hatched in the laboratory. These were washed to remove soil and debris and put into brine to discard empty or unviable ones. When needed, these were hatched without prior decapsulation to keep their bacterial load, following standards procedures (Lavens and Sorgeloos 1996). Water samples were collected in 1 L polyethylene brand new bottles previously washed three times with sterile 136 Extremophiles (2015) 19:135–147 123 distillated water, and then filtered with Miracloth (Calbiochem) filter paper (typical pore size 22–25 lm) and 5 lm filter paper (Advantec MFS, No. 2), then between 30 and 500 mL of each sample was filtered with 0.2 lm acetate cellulose filters (Sartorius, 47 mm diameter). Samples were kept in 1.6 mL vials at -20 C. Artemia individuals (adults) were collected with a plankton mesh and kept in 1.6 mL tubes filled with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol (Merck). DNA extraction For field and laboratory samples, Artemia adults, male or female, kept in ethanol (70 %) were washed tree times with sterile ultrapure water and dissected with sterile tools under a stereoscope microscope to first cut-off thoracopods, head, ovisac and furca to isolate the digestive tube (gut), ideally free of bacteria adhered to the external surface, which was processed in 1.6 mL tubes with 500 lL of lysis buffer (40 mM EDTA, Tris 50 mM, sucrose, pH 8.3). Filters with bacterial samples taken from brines and from laboratory cultures were cut-off into small pieces and covered with 500 lL of lysis buffer. Gut samples were homogenized with a pipette by blowing up and down until complete homogenization of the soft Artemia tissues was achieved, and incubated with lysozyme (Sigma) for 45 min. at 37 C, with 5 lg of RNAse (Qiagen) during 45 min at 37 C and, finally, with 100 lg of Proteinase K (Sigma) and 1 % SDS over 1 h at 55 C. DNA was extracted with phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, vol/vol/vol) and with chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1, vol/vol), and the aqueous phase was purified and concentrated with Amicon Ultra-4 tubes (100 K) as in Dumestre et al. (2002). Extracts were quantified with Quant IT system (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. PCRs were made in a total of 50 lL volume of reaction containing: 1.5 mM MgCl2; 0.18 lg/lL BSA; 300 lM each dNTP’s (Promega); 500 nM of each bacteria-specific primer and one unit of Taq polymerase (Biotaq, Bioline). Primers considered were specific to bacteria, BAC358F-GC: 50-C CTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-30 (Muyzer et al. 1993); BAC907RM: 50-CGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-30 (Casamayor et al. 2000), while the CG-clamp utilized was: CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGTCCCGCCGCCCCC GCCCG-30 (Muyzer et al. 1993). PCR cycles considered 94 C (20), 94 C (3000), 55 C (10), 72 C (10) 35 times and 72 C (50) one time. DGGE gels were loaded with 500–600 ng of PCR product and run at 100 V in a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel with a 20–80 % urea–formamide gradient during 14 h at 60 C, and stained with SYBR gold. Gels were observed under a BioRad UV system, and the relevant bands were excised and incubated overnight in Milli-Q sterile water. The extracts were re-amplified following the protocol mentioned above, but using primers without GC-clamp. Amplicons were sequenced by Macrogen, Korea, and electropherograms were manually screened. Data analysis The curated sequences were manually analyzed with BioEdit (Hall 1999) and Bellerophon (Huber et al. 2004) to discard chimeras. Alignment was performed with PyNAST (Caporaso et al. 2010), whereas matching to the closest Table 1 Locations of Artemia sites used in this study, coordinates and some basic limnological characteristics of these sites Map Zone Sampling site Code Coordinates Salinity (ppt) pH T C South East North Cejar CJR 23.063.410 68.214684 154 9.10 13.5 Piedra LAP 23.057742 68.217907 97 9.90 9.0 Barro Negro BNG 23.288228 68.177551 151 8.90 10.0 Center Cahuil CAH 34.507177 71.981357 252 7.65 34.0 Lo Valdivia LOV 34.698113 72.012154 231 7.71 31.8 South Amarga LAM 50.973499 72.732699 104 9.80 6.0 De la Sal LDS 53.284127 70.390975 112 8.30 12.5 De los Cisnesa LAC 53.240633 70.343.870 35 7.85 19.3 a Artemia samples from these locations were used to establish laboratory cultures, except for De los Cisnes Lagoon, the only site where only cysts were exclusively found.

Map indicates the number of samples collected in northern, central and southern Chile Extremophiles (2015) 19:135–147 137 123 relative genera was done using ‘‘nucleotide blast’’ (blastn) in GenBank. The taxonomic identity was further refined comparing 16S rDNA sequences with the ARB phylogeny package (Ludwig et al. 2004; Database 2007). Partial sequences retrieved from DGGE gels were inserted in the tree keeping the overall topology using the Parsimony Interactive tool implemented in ARB. Gel analyses (number of bands and intensity) were made using Image J (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) in comparable DGGE gels (Fig. 7). Diversity (Shannon diversity index, H’) and statistical analyses were performed with PAST diversity software (Hammer et al. 2001). Shannon was calculated for every location and each environment assessed (F_W, F_G, L_W, L_G). Diversity analysis for each environment considered all locations averaged. Statistical significance was estimated with Student’s t distribution (2–2), with n-1 degrees of freedom. Two types of comparisons were done, first, to evaluate how natural (field) bacterial communities were represented, or conserved, in the gut of field and Artemia laboratory-reared animals, as well as in the water of laboratory cultures. The analysis was extended to compare species. Such comparisons were made with R Project for Statistical Computing: http://www.r-project.org (R Core Team 2013), using the ‘‘vegan’’ package and the ‘‘vegdist’’ function. The Bray–Curtis quantitative dissimilarity index was used to get data from bands intensity, while the qualitative Sørensen (similarity index) for such binaries was calculated. To facilitate interpretation of Bray–Curtis index, data were expressed as 1-dissimilarity, and for this the following R functions were considered: aov for oneway ANOVA and Tukey HSD, a posteriori comparison, to detect significant differences. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers Sequences retrieved from bands were deposited in GenBank with Accession Numbers from LK391422 to LK391467 for DGGE bands 1–46 (corresponding to water samples), and from LK391468 to LK391504 for bands 47–83 (corresponding to Artemia gut samples). Results A total of 28 samples were analyzed: 14 water samples (7 natural sites and 7 laboratory cultures) and 14 Artemia gut samples (7 natural locations and 7 laboratory cultures). 192 DGGE sequenced bands were available for analysis, but after detailed inspection of electropherograms 83 sequences were finally considered (Fig. 1). Alignments revealed an average of 97.8 % identity and 99.8 % of coverage to 41 bacterial genera (Table 2) belonging to Phyla Proteobacteria (55.4 % of sequences match), Bacteroidetes (22.9 %), Actinobacteria (16.9 %) and Firmicutes (4.8 %). Figure 2 displays the most closely related genera found in GenBank, and their phylogenetic relationship to the sequences isolated from DGGE gels. The percentage of total band intensity in the DGGE fingerprints reported per Phyla, sample site, and environment (Field, Lab, and Gut) is provided in Fig. 3. Except for BNG (L_W), a site in the north with all bands sequenced, the non-sequenced bands were over 60 %. However, non-sequenced bands showed, on average, lower intensity in relation to the total band intensity than those sequenced hence most of the potentially predominant bacterial populations were targeted (see Fig. 4). Ecological diversity of microbial assemblages Environmental (field) bacterioplankton (Fig. 5) turned out to be the most ecologically diverse (Shannon–Weaver index, H0 2.69 ± 0.30, n = 7), and such diversity was subsequently reduced in the gut of laboratory-reared (H0 2.35 ± 0.45, n = 7) and field individuals (H0 2.05 ± 0.28, n = 7), and in the laboratory (water) environment (H’ 1.97 ± 0.56, n = 7), the less diverse of all the environments assessed. Significant differences occurred between FLD/WTR and LAB/WTR samples (p \ 0.01), and these were highly significant for FLD/WTR and FLD/GUT (p \ 0.001). There were no significant differences between ecological diversity of laboratory samples (water and gut) and gut samples (field and laboratory). With regard to the natural sites sampled, the higher to lower ecological diversity ranking showed the gut of Cejar (CJR) laboratory individuals in first place (H0 3.2) followed by De la Sal (LDS) field water samples, while water of Lo Valdivia Artemia cultures exhibited the lowest bacterial diversity (H0 1.39). Similarity of bacterial communities to field water (brines) samples Field water samples (F_W), were pairwise compared with the remaining samples (Fig. 6) and significant differences (One-way ANOVA, p \ 0.05) were found. The closest similarity to the natural condition was found in the gut of field-collected individuals (F_G), whose diversity significantly differed to that observed in the gut of laboratory animals (L_G) (Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference, p value \0.05). Such difference was greater using the Bray–Curtis index (15 % to Bray–Curtis and 19 % to Sorensen) that allowed to report inter-species differences by comparing presence/absence of DGGE bands. 138 Extremophiles (2015) 19:135–147 123 Environment–bacteria relationship None of the bacterial genera detected was present in all the environments assessed (field, lab and gut), except Psychroflexus that appeared in almost all field water samples and other environments assessed. Other common genera detected were Chromohalobacter, Sphingomonas and Amaricoccus. Three genera were solely detected in one specific environment such as Sphingomonas (F_G), Amaricoccus (L_G), Ornithinimicrobium (L_G) and Firmicutes (Paenibacillus and Halolactibacillus) (F_G). Only 24 bacterial genera were not repeated in other locations. Discussion From an ecosystem point of view, the Artemia–bacteria coexistence in hypersaline lakes should translate in some sort of functional relationship, a view in agreement with the fact that bacteria can interact in many ways (parasitic, mutualistic, symbiotic) with all kind of organisms, including aquatic invertebrates (Harris 1993). The nonselective filter feeder condition of Artemia provides opportunities for bacterial colonization of the gut. This study approached such coexistence at different levels: the field-natural realm, including salterns (semi-artificial Fig. 1 Negative image of DGGE gels of: a water samples from laboratory cultures (LAB) and field (FLD); b Artemia gut of laboratory-reared (LAB) and animals collected in the field (FLD).

We also considered the species level represented by the two American species, A. franciscana and A. persimilis, both present in Chile, the former widely distributed in the Americas (North, Center and South), central Chile being the southern edge of its distribution, while A. persimilis is restricted to southern latitudes in Chile and Argentina (Gajardo et al. 2002; Gajardo and Beardmore 2012). This study confirmed the large bacterial diversity existing in natural salty lakes, but at the same time showed how such natural diversity is greatly reduced in the gut environment of field and laboratory-reared animals and in the laboratory environment (water) as well, which turned out to be the least diverse in bacterial communities. Such bacteria stratification can be consequence of their differential survival to the selective pressures imposed by each environment, though further temporal monitoring along with more specific experimental studies would be required to confirm this. Such heterogeneous distribution of bacterial types is likely to affect, directly or indirectly, different aspects of the Artemia life cycle, the food web the animal depends on and, perhaps, its tolerance to abiotic conditions. Particularly sensitive should be the female reproductive mode (ovoviviparity, oviparity) which is synchronized by unknown environmental cues. The gut microbiota might also influence Artemia survival in nature and laboratory cultures by providing specific functional capabilities such as food processing and uptake (Intriago and Jones 1993; Gorospe et al. 1996), immunological competence (OrozcoMedina et al. 2002; Villamil et al. 2003) and other phenotypes alike, as shown for other invertebrates (Sharon et al. 2010). Bacterial diversity High average bacterial diversity has been reported in natural lakes of northern Chile (Demergasso et al. 2004, 2008; Dorador et al. 2009; Stivaletta et al. 2011) and in salterns elsewhere (Benlloch et al. 2002; Casamayor et al. 2002; Tkavc et al. 2011). Such high diversity is confirmed in this study, but the heterogeneities observed among the comparisons made, i.e., natural sites (brines), gut, and laboratory environment (water of Artemia cultures) can be attributed, or correlated to salinity differences as it has been previously reported in evaporation ponds of salterns, where bacteria community composition and ecological interactions strongly varied among the salinity gradients (Benlloch et al. 2002; Casamayor et al. 2002; Estrada et al. 2004; Gasol et al. 2004; Tkavc et al. 2011). The substantially different conditions under which Artemia cultures were maintained in the laboratory (for convenience, artificial seawater at 35 ppt) explain also why bacterial diversity in the natural and the laboratory realms (water) differs significantly. At the moment of sampling, salinity in natural salty lakes was about 97 ppt, and increased up to 252 ppt in salterns (Table 1). Also weather conditions affect the comparison between Artemia sites in northern, central and southern sites, and hence the physico-chemical and ionic water conditions. The latter is also explained by the fact that inland and coastal locations were sampled, which differ in the water ionic composition (Castro et al. 2006). This study is, therefore, considered a snapshot of the existing bacterial diversity at sampling, which was done along different periods owing to the remoteness of sites and the distance between them. For this reason, differences among sites are not emphasized, either comparisons to other studies for similar locations in Chile (Demergasso et al. 2004) or elsewhere (Riddle et al. 2013). In addition, methodological biases could affect the Shannon diversity index which relates the total number of bands per sample and their relative abundance (intensity), overestimating diversity due to the possible presence of heteroduplex (Casamayor et al. 2002), though the refinement process based on manual analysis of sequences minimized this factor. Yet, the method is particularly good for monitoring changes in bacterial communities in the different environment assessed, according to Benlloch et al. (2002). Finally, the total number of sequenced bands was unevenly distributed over the environments compared. It is worth to highlight the natural environment as a bacterial diversity reservoir, and how such diversity is subsequently reduced in the gut of field and laboratory-reared animals, the water of laboratory cultures being the less variable, a finding consistent with the stringent selective pressures of laboratory conditions. In spite of having reduced variability, the gut of field animals maintains higher similarity in bacterial communities to natural brines (Fig. 6). Albeit partially, this means wild Artemia individuals tend to reflect the bacterial diversity of the environment they inhabit, be it nature or laboratory, a finding consistent with the fact that bacterial colonization of the gut is facilitated by the non-selective filter feeder nature of Artemia. It is known that brine shrimps contain gut resident bacteria (Niu et al. 2012), but what bacterial types become resident, or gut-adapted, depends on their functional capabilities such as ability for biofilm formation, or to synthesize adhesive molecules to allow attachment to the intestine membrane. It is worth noting in this regard that Vibrio species appear to be common colonizers of Artemia intestine in some saline systems (Tkavc et al. 2011), and such adhesive properties are importantly associated to its pathogenicity for Artemia and other crustaceans (OrozcoMedina et al. 2009). We found one band matching Salinivibrio in natural brines of Amarga lagoon in Patagonia. Extremophiles (2015) 19:135–147 141 123 142 Extremophiles (2015) 19:135–147 123 This study cannot confirm bacterial types found in the gut as residents, since a different technical approach would be required to exclude the interference of transient (luminal) and body-surface bacterial types (Niu et al. 2012). It is interesting though to highlight that gut of wild-collected animals maintains a fraction of the natural diversity and, in some cases, bacteria not found in the water. How does happen remains uncertain, but it is useful to mention the salt crusts surrounding natural lakes as probable bacteria reservoirs, according to Stivaletta et al. (2011) who studied Piedra Lagoon (LAP), one of the locations sampled in this study. A seasonal wash-out of bacteria from salt crushes occurs during the rainy season, when water level increases. Hence, salt crushes act as a sort of bacterial shelter when ponds tend to dry-out. Such bacteria reservoirs have been also reported in Tunisian salty lakes (Baati et al. 2010). Environment-type specific bacteria The differential bacteria survival in each of the assayed environments raises the question on how such bacteria could affect Artemia fitness, once incorporated into the gut. Based on a previous study showing bacteria help Artemia to degrade microalgae (Intriago and Jones 1993), this section discusses the reported functional capabilities for the principal bacterial types observed in this work. We reckon such information provides preliminary insights on how such bacteria could contribute to Artemia survival and reproduction. For example, Sphingomonas (Alphaproteobacteria) was exclusively found in the gut of wild Artemia individuals, a genus reported to have the ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), b Fig. 2 Maximum parsimony tree showing the phylogenetic position of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences recovered from DGGE bands. Tree shows the closest relative matching each of the sequences included. Each sequence is scored as environment/site/band number, respectively, 273 9 372 mm (300 9 300 DPI) Fig. 3 Relative abundance of known and unknown DGGE bands distributed by Phylum, environment (WTR, GUT, FLD, LAB) and sample site (CJR Cejar, BNG Barro Negro, LAP Piedra, CAH Cahuil, LOV Lo Valdivia, LAM Amarga, LAC De los Cisnes, and LDS De la Sal).

Standard deviation is indicated Fig. 6 Similarity to F_W samples of bacterial communities in different environments: a Gut of field (F_G) and laboratory-reared animals (L_G), water from laboratory cultures (L_W); b Artemia species 200 9 150 mm (300 9 300 DPI) 144 Extremophiles (2015) 19:135–147 123 known as persistent pollutants accumulating in the food chain (Yabuuchi et al. 2001; Jones et al. 2001). Chromohalobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) was mainly identified in the gut of wild Artemia collected in north, center and south Chile, but also in some cultured animals. Members of this genus (C. salexigens) produce ectoine (or hydroxyectoine) a compound protecting proteins from degradation, and from other environmental stressors such as salinity changes, oxidative stress and high UV radiation (Cánovas et al. 1998; Vargas et al. 2008). Ectoine and other compatible solutes also act as osmoprotectants facilitating bacteria establishment in saline environments (Oren 2008). Psychroflexus (Bacteroidetes) was the most ubiquitous genus, previously described in the Atacama Desert (Demergasso et al. 2004, 2008, 2010; Dorador et al. 2009), as well as in inland salt lakes in Spain (Casamayor et al. 2013). It was found in water and some gut samples of animals collected in Cejar (north) and Amarga (south), two quite contrasting natural hypersaline lagoons (3,600 km apart). Psychrophilic bacteria are known to produce anti-freeze proteins, and some bacteria found in salty lakes of the Atacama Desert are phylogenetically closer to some types found in the Antarctic. Such similarity tells about convergent environmental conditions in spite of the contrasting latitudes (Dorador et al. 2008). The species P. salinarum has been reported in salterns elsewhere (Yoon et al. 2009), an indication of the ecological and physiological abilities of psychrophilic bacteria. An exclusive and recurrent bacteria detected in Artemia gut of the laboratory environment was Amaricoccus sp. (Alphaproteobacteria), and particularly A. kaplicensis, exhibits high capacity to store poly b-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) (Falvo et al. 2001), an effective inhibitor of pathogenic Vibrio campbelli in Artemia franciscana (Defoirdt et al. 2007; Halet et al. 2007). This molecule (PHB) could be considered a cost-effective method for bacterial control in aquaculture if, for example, it is encapsulated in Artemia to feed fish larvae. The finding of Amaricoccus in the gut of cultured Artemia individuals could be related to the high pathogen exposure under laboratory conditions. Another aspect worth to mention is the fact that a significant part of bacteria found in the gut of field animals were not detected in the gut of laboratory-reared animals, for example Paenibacillus sp. and Sphingomonas sp, Betaproteobacteria appeared mainly in laboratory water samples (Fig. 3). Some final words on the relevance of bacteria associated with the Artemia species found in Chile. A. franciscana is the most widely distributed species, a feature attributed to its plasticity, genetic variability at coding and not-coding regions, and many other virtues (Gajardo et al. 2002). Instead, A. persimilis is restricted to southern latitudes and differs genetically and phenotypically from A. franciscana, but the species seems to preserve higher environmental bacteria than A. franciscana (Fig. 6b). The meaning of this requires further investigation, and both species are nice model systems to go any further on this topic. Finally, the study of Artemia–bacteria association has practical consequences for the use of Artemia as live diet for the larviculture of marine fish, as Artemia cysts are bacterial vectors to the laboratory environment (Riddle et al. 2013).
