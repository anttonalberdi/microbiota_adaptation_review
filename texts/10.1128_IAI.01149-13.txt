The E. coli MG1655 envZ gene encodes a histidine kinase that is a member of the envZ-ompR two-component signal transduction system, which regulates outer membrane protein profiles. In the present investigation, the envZP41L gene was transferred from the intestinally selected E. coli MG1655 mutant to E. coli Nissle 1917, a human probiotic strain used to treat gastrointestinal infections. Both the E. coli MG1655 and E. coli Nissle 1917 strains containing envZP41L produced more phosphorylated OmpR than their parents. The E. coli Nissle 1917 strain containing envZP41L also became more resistant to bile salts and colicin V and grew 50% slower in vitro in mucus and 15% to 30% slower on several sugars present in mucus, yet it was a 10-fold better colonizer than E. coli Nissle 1917. However, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was not better at preventing colonization by enterohemorrhagic E. coli EDL933. The data can be explained according to our “restaurant” hypothesis for commensal E. coli strains, i.e., that they colonize the intestine as sessile members of mixed biofilms, obtaining the sugars they need for growth locally, but compete for sugars with invading E. coli pathogens planktonically. Previously we reported that when streptomycin-treated miceare fed wild-type Escherichia coli MG1655, the intestine selects for nonmotile flhDC deletion mutants (1, 2) and envZ missense mutants (3), both of which are better colonizers than the wild type. The flhDC mutants have deletions of various sizes, beginning downstream of an IS1 element in the flhDC regulatory region and extending into or beyond the flhDC structural genes (1, 2). FlhD and FlhC form the FlhD4C2 complex (4), which activates transcription of class II flagellar genes that encode components of the flagellar basal body and export machinery (5). The IS1 element immediately upstream of the E. coli MG1655 flhDC promoter increases expression of the flhDC operon and makes E. coli MG1655 hypermotile (1, 6). One of the better-colonizing nonmotile flhDC deletion mutants, E. coli MG1655 flhD, grew 15% faster in vitro in mouse cecal mucus and 15% to 30% faster on several sugars present in cecal mucus than E. coli MG1655 (1), presumably explaining its better colonizing ability. Additional studies suggested that the E. coli MG1655 flhDC operon deletion mutants utilize sugars better than their parent at least in part because a number of metabolic genes are repressed by the FlhD4C2 regulatory complex, including gltA (citrate synthase), sdhCDAB (succinate dehydrogenase), mdh (malate dehydrogenase), mglBAC (galactose transport), and a large number of sugar catabolism operons (7–9). EnvZ, a histidine kinase, and OmpR, its cognate response regulator, comprise a two-component signal transduction system that modulates gene expression in response to osmolarity (10). Among the many activities controlled by EnvZ-OmpR are transcription of ompF, which encodes an E. coli outer membrane porin that allows passage of bile salts as well as other small molecules from the environment into the periplasm (11); transcription of the flhDC operon (12); and transcription of omrA and omrB, which encode two small RNAs that regulate the expression of a number of outer membrane proteins, including CirA, the receptor for colicin V (13). The better-colonizing E. coli MG1655 envZ missense mutants were more resistant to bile salts and colicin V than E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 flhD and were less motile than E. coli MG1655, consistent with them containing a higher level of phosphorylated OmpR (OmpRP) (3). One better-colonizing E. coli MG1655 envZ missense mutant which was studied further, i.e., E. coli MG1655 mot-1 (referred to here as E. coli MG1655 envZP41L), grew about 15% slower in mouse cecal mucus in vitro and on several sugars present in mucus than E. coli MG1655 flhD, but it grew 30% faster on galactose (3). In addition, despite growing slower in mouse cecal mucus in vitro, E. coli MG1655 envZP41L appeared to colonize one intestinal niche in the cecum as well as E. coli MG1655 flhD, suggesting that factors other than competition for nutrients were responsible, and it apReceived 9 September 2013 Returned for modification 11 October 2013 Accepted 18 November 2013 Published ahead of print 25 November 2013 Editor: B.

E. coli Nissle 1917 is a commensal strain that has been used as a probiotic agent to treat gastrointestinal infections in humans since the early 1920s (14). Several features of E. coli Nissle 1917 have been proposed to be responsible for its probiotic nature, including its ability to express two microcins (15), the absence of known protein toxins, its semirough lipopolysaccharide, and hence serum sensitivity (16, 17), and the presence of six iron uptake systems (18). To study the envZ derivative encoding the P41L mutation (envZP41L) further, we constructed an envZP41L derivative of E. coli Nissle 1917 and in the present study characterized the strain and tested whether it has improved mouse intestinal colonizing ability and whether it is better at limiting colonization of E. coli EDL933, a human enterohemorrhagic strain. We found that E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L is not a better probiotic, but like E. coli MG1655 envZP41L, it colonized an intestinal niche not colonized by wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917. We discuss the results in terms of the restaurant hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains. Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The original E. coli K-12 strain was obtained from a stool sample from a convalescing diphtheria patient in Palo Alto, CA, in 1922 (19). The sequenced E. coli MG1655 strain (CGSC 7740) was derived from the original K-12 strain, having only been cured of the temperate bacteriophage lambda and the F plasmid by means of UV light and acridine orange treatment (19). It has an IS1 element in the flhDC promoter (20). E. coli Nissle 1917 was originally isolated during World War I from a soldier who escaped a severe outbreak of diarrhea (14). It has a beneficial effect on several types of intestinal disorders, is well tolerated by humans, and has been marketed as a probiotic remedy against intestinal disorders in several European countries since the 1920s (14). The allelic exchange method described by Datsenko and Wanner (21) was used to construct E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat (Table 1), which contains a 912-bp deletion replaced by a chloramphenicol cassette beginning 153 bp downstream of the ATG start codon and ending 78 bp upstream of the TGA stop codon. As expected, E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat failed to grow in M9 minimal medium (22) containing 0.4% (wt/vol) galactose as the sole carbon and energy source. E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat was restored to the Gal phenotype by allelic replacement (21), TABLE 1 Bacterial strains used in this studya E. coli strain Description Name used in text Source or reference EDL933 Strr Rifr Spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of EDL933 Strr EDL933 34 MG1655 Strr Spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant of MG1655 MG1655 3 MG1655 Strr Nalr Spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of MG1655 Strr MG1655 3 MG1655 Strr mot-1 P41L envZ missense mutant of MG1655 Strr MG1655 envZP41L 3 MG1655 Strr mot-2 P148S envZ missense mutant of MG1655 Strr MG1655 envZP148S 3 MG1655 Strr mot-3 V33E envZ missense mutant of MG1655 Strr MG1655 envZV33E 3 MG1655 Strr Nalr mot-1 Spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of MG1655 Strr mot-1 MG1655 envZP41L 3 MG1655 Strr Nalr mot-1 restored MG1655 Strr mot-1 restored to wild type with respect to EnvZ MG1655 envZP41L restored to wild type with respect to EnvZ 3 MG1655 Strr envZNis MG1655 Str r with the Nissle 1917 envZ gene MG1655 envZNis This study MG1655 Strr Nalr envZNis Spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of MG1655 Str r envZNis MG1655 envZNis This study Nissle 1917 Strr Spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant of Nissle 1917 Nissle 1917 34 Nissle 1917 Strr Nalr Spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of Nissle 1917 Strr Nissle 1917 34 Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L Nissle 1917 Str r with the envZP41L gene in place of its own Nissle 1917 envZP41L This study Nissle 1917 Strr Nalr envZP41L Spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L Nissle 1917 envZP41L This study Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L restored Nissle 1917 Str r envZP41L restored to wild type with respect to EnvZ Nissle 1917 envZP41L restored to wild type with respect to EnvZ This study Nissle 1917 Strr galK::cat 912-bp deletion in galactokinase gene replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette Nissle 1917 galK::cat This study Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat Same deletion as in Nissle 1917 Strr galK::cat Nissle 1917 envZP41L galK::cat This study Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK:: cat restored Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat restored to wild type with respect to galK Nissle 1917 envZP41L galK::cat restored to wild type with respect to galK This study Nissle 1917 Strr Nalr envZP41L galK::cat restored Spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat restored Nissle 1917 envZP41L galK::cat restored to wild type with respect to galK This study F-18 Strr Rifr Spontaneous streptomycinand rifampin-resistant mutant of F-18 F-18 31 BW37751(pKD267)::Kanr The plasmid in this strain contains parE under the control of the rhamnose promoter and the kanamycin resistance gene pKD267 Barry Wanner a Strr, streptomycin resistant; Rifr, rifampin resistant; Nalr, nalidixic acid resistant; Kanr, kanamycin resistant.

The restored Gal strain grew at the same rate as E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L in M9 galactose minimal medium. The E. coli MG1655 envZ gene was replaced with the E. coli Nissle 1917 wild-type envZ gene by an unpublished allelic replacement strategy developed by Barry Wanner and Kiryl Datsenko at Purdue University, as described previously (3). The same method was used to replace the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene with the envZP41L gene. All constructions were confirmed by sequencing. Growth of strains and sample preparation for detection of phosphorylated OmpR. Bacteria were grown overnight in the presence of 100 g/ml of streptomycin sulfate in M9 minimal medium (22) supplemented with 0.2% glucose or M63 medium (23) supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 0.0005% vitamin B1. Cells were diluted 100to 200-fold in the same medium or medium supplemented with 150 mM NaCl or 15% sucrose, respectively. Cultures (32 to 35 ml) were grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5 to 0.7 and harvested by centrifugation at 14,500  g for 10 min at 4°C. Samples were prepared for Phos-tag analysis as described by Wayne et al. (24), with the following changes. For samples grown in M63 medium, cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of cold 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, supplemented with 15% sucrose and EDTAfree bacterial protease inhibitor cocktail (RPI Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). Suspensions were transferred to chilled tubes of lysing matrix B (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), and cells were disrupted by two 40-s cycles of homogenization at a speed of 6.0 m/s in a FastPrep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals). Samples were chilled on ice for 5 min between disruption cycles. For samples grown in M9 medium, cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of cold BugBuster master mix (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with EDTA-free bacterial protease inhibitor cocktail (RPI Corp.). Suspensions were transferred to chilled tubes of lysing matrix B (MP Biomedicals) and incubated on a platform shaker for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were disrupted by one 20-s cycle of homogenization at a speed of 4.0 m/s in a FastPrep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals). After cell disruption, all samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C, and 75 l of each cleared lysate was mixed with cold 4 Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples were frozen on dry ice and stored at 80°C until analysis. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and detection of OmpR and OmpRP. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described by Wayne et al. (24), with the following changes. Samples were thawed briefly on ice. Approximately 16 OD600 units of each sample was loaded into each well of a chilled 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 25 M or 50 M Phostag acrylamide (AAL-107; Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA) and then separated by electrophoresis at 140 V for 2.25 h at 4°C. Proteins were transferred to a 0.45-m Immobilon-P membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride [PVDF]; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 30 V for 15 h, followed by an additional 1 h at 100 V. Membranes were blocked in 3% (wt/vol) Amersham ECL blocking agent (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) in 1 Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.5% (vol/vol) Tween 20, incubated in a 1:50 to 1:80 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit antiOmpR antibody for 24 h at 4°C, and then incubated in a 1:100,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce Antibodies, Rockford, IL) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Signals were detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Antibodies) followed by exposure to Hyblot-CL film (Denville Scientific Inc., Plainfield, NJ). Outer membrane protein analysis. Outer membrane fractions were prepared as described by Morona and Reeves (25), with the following modifications. Briefly, bacteria were grown overnight in LB broth supplemented with 100 g/ml of streptomycin sulfate. Cells were diluted 100to 200-fold in medium A (26) and medium A supplemented with 15% sucrose and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 to 1.0. Cultures (25 to 30 ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000  g for 15 min at 4°C, and cell pellets were frozen on dry ice. After storage at 20°C, pellets were thawed on ice and suspended in 0.2 ml of 20% (wt/vol) sucrose in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Fifty microliters of lysozyme solution (5 mg/ml) in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M EDTA, pH 8.0, was added to each suspension. After 30 min of incubation on ice, 5 ml of cold 3 mM EDTA was added to the suspensions, which were mixed by vortexing and sonicated three times for 30 s at power setting 7, using a Fisher Scientific model 100 Sonic Dismembrator instrument. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000  g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 21,000  g for 1 h at 4°C, and membrane pellets were suspended in 100 l of 4 Laemmli buffer. Samples were heated at 95°C for 10 min before electrophoresis at 125 V on 4 M urea, 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Other media and growth conditions. LB broth Lennox (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), LB agar Lennox (Difco), and MacConkey agar (Difco) were used for routine cultivation. SOC medium was prepared as described by Datsenko and Wanner (21). For testing of carbon and energy source utilization, M9 minimal medium (22) was modified by addition of 120 mM NaCl to more closely approximate the sodium chloride concentration in the intestine (27). Growth was also tested in cecal mucus (2.5 mg protein/ml) in HEPES-Hanks buffer (pH 7.0), which contains 137 mM NaCl, the sodium chloride concentration in jejunal and ileal intestinal fluid (27). Cultures were prepared and growth was monitored as described previously (1). Isolation of cecal mucus. Mouse cecal mucus was isolated as previously described (28). Briefly, mice (5 to 8 weeks old) were fed Teklad mouse and rat diet (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI) for 5 days after being received. The drinking water was then replaced with sterile distilled water containing streptomycin sulfate (5 g/liter). Twenty-four hours later, the mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and their ceca were removed. The cecal contents were washed out with sterile distilled water, and cecal mucus was scraped into HEPES-Hanks buffer (pH 7.0), centrifuged, and sterilized by UV irradiation as described previously (28). All animal protocols were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals at the University of Rhode Island. Motility. Motility of E. coli Nissle 1917 strains was assayed by transferring colonies by toothpick from LB agar Lennox onto Luria motility agar as described previously (3). Plates were incubated at 37°C for 6 h, after which spreading was measured from the edge of each colony. Growth in the presence of 5% bile salts. Strains to be tested for bile sensitivity were grown overnight in LB broth Lennox, diluted to an OD600 of about 0.1 in fresh LB broth Lennox containing 5% (wt/vol) Bacto bile salts no. 3 (Difco Laboratories), and incubated at 37°C with shaking in 125-ml tissue culture bottles. Growth was monitored as described previously (1). Mouse colonization experiments. The specifics of the streptomycintreated mouse model used to compare the large intestine-colonizing abilities of E. coli strains in mice have been described previously (3). Briefly, sets of three male CD-1 mice (5 to 8 weeks old) were given drinking water containing streptomycin sulfate (5 g/liter) for 24 h to eliminate resident facultative bacteria (29). Following 18 h of starvation for food and water, the mice were fed 1 ml of 20% (wt/vol) sucrose containing 105 CFU or 1010 CFU of LB broth Lennox-grown E. coli strains, as described in Results. After ingestion of the bacterial suspension, both the food (Teklad mouse and rat diet; Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI) and streptomycin-water were returned to the mice, and 1 g of feces was collected after 5 h and 24 h and on odd-numbered days, at the indicated times. Mice were housed individually in cages without bedding and were placed in clean cages at 24-h intervals. Individual fecal pellets were therefore no older than 24 h. Each fecal sample (1 g) was homogenized in 10 ml of 1% Bacto tryptone (Difco), diluted in the same medium, and plated on MacConkey agar plates with appropriate antibiotics. When appropriate, 1 ml of a fecal homogenate (sampled after the feces had settled) was centrifuged at 12,000  g, resuspended in 100 l of 1% Bacto tryptone, and plated on a MacConkey agar plate with appropriate antibiotics. This procedure increased the sensitivity of the assay from 102 CFU/g of feces to 10 CFU/per g of feces. To distinguish the various E. coli strains in feces, dilutions were plated on lactose MacConkey agar containing streptomycin sulfate (100 g/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 g/ml) and nalidixic acid (50 g/ml), Adediran et al. 672 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity D ow nl oa de d fr om h ttp s: //j ou rn al s. as m .o rg /jo ur na l/i ai o n 24 J an ua ry 2 02 2 by 1 30 .2 25 .1 88 .1 28 . streptomycin sulfate (100 g/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 g/ml), or streptomycin sulfate (100 g/ml) and rifampin (50 g/ml). Streptomycin sulfate, chloramphenicol, and nalidixic acid were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). All plates were incubated for 18 to 24 h at 37°C prior to counting. When necessary to distinguish strains, 100 colonies from plates containing streptomycin were transferred by toothpick onto MacConkey agar plates containing streptomycin and nalidixic acid or onto MacConkey agar plates containing streptomycin and chloramphenicol. Each colonization experiment was performed at least twice, with essentially identical results. Pooled data from at least two independent experiments (for a total of six mice) are presented in the figures. Sequencing and primers. DNA sequencing was done at the URI Genomics and Sequencing Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, using an Applied Biosystems 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for the sequencing reactions. Primers were designed using the E. coli K-12 genome sequence (20) or the E. coli CFT073 genome sequence (30), which is closely related to the E. coli Nissle 1917 genome sequence (18). The galK deletion primers used to make E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr galK:: cat (uppercase letters, E. coli Nissle 1917 DNA; lowercase letters, chloramphenicol resistance cassette DNA) were as follows: primer 1, 5=-AAACG TAAAAAGTCTCTTTAATACCTGTTTTTGCTTCATATTGTTCAGC gtgtaggctggagctgcttcg-3=; and primer 2, 5=-CGACTACAACGAC GGTTTCGTTCTGCCCTGCGCGATTGATTATCAAACCcatatgaata tcctccttagt-3=. The primers used for both amplifying the galK::cat deletion for allelic exchange into E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L and sequencing to confirm its presence in both E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr galK::cat and E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat were as follows: primer 1 (43 bp upstream of the galK coding sequence), 5=-AACAGGCAGCAGAGCGTT TGC-3=; and primer 2 (53 bp downstream of the galK coding sequence), 5=-AGTCCATCAGCGTGACTACCATC-3=. The same primers were used for replacement of the galK::cat mutation in E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr envZP41L galK::cat with the wild-type galK gene and for confirmation of the replacement by sequencing. Replacing the E. coli MG1655 envZ gene with the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene was done in two steps. First, to replace the E. coli MG1655 envZ gene with the cassette encoding kanamycin resistance (kan) and with parE under the control of the rhamnose promoter (kan-rhaP-parE) (3), the following primers were used on pKD267 DNA (uppercase letters, E. coli MG1655 DNA; lowercase letters, kan-rhaP-parE DNA): primer 1, 5=-GT ATCTTATAGAAAGCAAAACGGGAGGCACCTTCGCCTCCCGTTTA TTTACCCTCTTTTGTCtcccgctcagaagaactcgt-3=; and primer 2, 5=-GC TTCTCGCCACGAAGTTCATTTGCCCGTACGTTATTGCTCAT CGTCACCTTGCTGTTCGggatccaatcagcccttgag-3=. Second, to replace the kan-rhaP-parE cassette in E. coli MG1655 with the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene, the following primers were used on E. coli Nissle 1917 DNA (uppercase letters, sequence common to E. coli MG1655 and E. coli Nissle 1917; lowercase letters, sequence found only in E. coli MG1655): primer 1, 5=-tatctatccagtatcttatagaaagcAAAACGGGAGGCACCTTCGCCT CCCGTTTATTTACCCTTCTTTTGTC-3=; and primer 2, 5=-TCTAAAG CATGAGGCGATTGCGCTTCTCGCCACGAAGT-3=. Replacing the E. coli Nissle envZ gene with the envZP41L gene was also done in two steps. First, to replace the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene with the cassette encoding kanamycin resistance (kan) and parE under the control of the rhamnose promoter (kan-rhaP-parE), the following primers were used on pKD267 DNA (uppercase letters, E. coli Nissle 1917 DNA; lowercase letters, kan-rhaP-parE DNA): primer 1, 5=-TTCATTAT CAATCAATTGAAAACAATCTAAAAACGGGAGGCACCTTCACC TCCCGTTTTTTTACCCTTCTTTTGTCtcccgctcagaagaactcgtc-3=; and primer 2, 5=-GCTTCTCGCCACGAAGTTCATTTGCCCGTACGTTATT GCTCATCGTCACCTTGCTGTTCGggatccaatcagcccttgag-3=.

The primers used for confirmation of the envZ replacements by sequencing were as follows: primer 1, 5=-GTAGCGGCT GGTCCGAA-3=; and primer 2, 5=-TAGCTGGTGACGAACGTGAG-3=. Colicin V sensitivity. E. coli F-18 produces colicin V (31). E. coli MG1655 strains to be tested for sensitivity to colicin V were grown overnight in LB broth Lennox at 37°C with shaking in 125-ml tissue culture bottles. The next day, 106 CFU of each strain to be tested was added to 3 ml of Luria broth Lennox containing 7 g/liter Difco agar (soft agar), which was then poured onto a 20-ml Luria broth Lennox agar plate. After the soft agar on each plate solidified, E. coli F-18 colonies were transferred by toothpick to each plate and incubated for 18 h at 37°C, and zones of growth inhibition were measured. FISH. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as described previously (3, 32). Briefly, the cecum of a mouse designated for FISH was cut into 1to 2-cm pieces, suspended in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura, Torrance, CA), and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane suspended in liquid nitrogen. Pieces were then stored at 80°C until ready for sectioning. For sectioning, an UltraPro 5000 cryostat (Vibratome, St. Louis, MO) was used to cut 10-m sections, which were adhered to polyL-lysine-treated slides for visualization. Slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a wash in phosphatebuffered saline for 10 min. Slides were allowed to air dry overnight prior to hybridization. Fluorescent probes were diluted in hybridization solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 0.9 M NaCl, and 0.1% SDS). The E. coli 23S rRNA-specific Cy-3 probe (5=-5Cy3-CAC CGT AGT GCC TCG TCA TCA-3=) (red) and the eubacterial 23S rRNA-specific FitC probe (5=-GCT GCC TCC CGT AGG AGT-36-FAM-3=) (green) were used at concentrations of 5 ng/l and 25 ng/l, respectively. Subsequently, 10 l of diluted probes in hybridization solution was pipetted onto each slide. Each slide was then covered with a HybriSlip hybridization cover (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and allowed to incubate in the dark for 2 h at 50°C. The slides were then placed in a wash buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and 0.9 M NaCl) and allowed to soak for 20 min at 50°C. Slides were then rinsed with distilled water and air dried overnight. Sections were viewed by confocal microscopy. Prior to viewing, sections on the poly-L-lysinetreated slides were treated with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), an antibleaching agent which helps to prolong fluorescence for imaging, and covered with a coverslip. Statistics. Means and standard deviations derived from the indicated numbers of samples in Tables 2 and 3 were compared by two-tailed Student’s t test (P values). The colonization data on E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L between days 3 and 15 in Fig. 5A were combined, as were those of E. coli Nissle 1917, and the means for the two strains were compared by two-tailed Student’s t test (see Fig. 5A). The same analysis was applied to E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L restored to the wild type with respect to envZ, as well as E. coli Nissle 1917 (see Fig. 5B). P values of 0.05 were interpreted as indicating no significant difference, and P values of 0.05 were interpreted as indicating a significant difference. RESULTS The E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene bestows no colonization advantage to E. coli MG1655. The E. coli Nissle 1917 EnvZ protein differs from that of E. coli MG1655 in two places: the V25A and M446T changes. Since E. coli Nissle 1917 is a probiotic strain considered to have enhanced colonization properties, it was possible that the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene (called envZNis here) might confer increased colonization ability to E. coli MG1655. To test this possibility, the E. coli MG1655 envZ gene was replaced with envZNis to create E. coli MG1655 envZNis, and the colonization ability of this strain was examined. E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 envZNis were found to be identical in colonization ability, Enhanced Colonization of an E. coli envZ Mutant February 2014 Volume 82 Number 2 iai.asm.org 673 D ow nl oa de d fr om h ttp s: //j ou rn al s. as m .o rg /jo ur na l/i ai o n 24 J an ua ry 2 02 2 by 1 30 .2 25 .1 88 .1 28 . i.e., when 105 CFU of each strain was fed to mice, the strains cocolonized equally well (Fig. 1A); when 1010 CFU of E. coli MG1655 envZNis and 10 5 CFU of E. coli MG1655 were fed to mice, the 105 ratio of the input CFU values of the 2 strains in feces was maintained throughout the 15-day duration of the experiment (Fig. 1B); and when 1010 CFU of E. coli MG1655 and 105 CFU of E. coli MG1655 envZNis were fed to mice, the 10 5 ratio of the input CFU values of the 2 strains was maintained in feces throughout the 15-day duration of the experiment (Fig. 1C). Therefore, despite the two amino acid differences between the wild-type envZ genes of E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli MG1655, the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene conferred no colonization advantage to E. coli MG1655. Effects of envZ missense mutations on OmpF, OmpC, and phosphorylated OmpR (OmpRP) in E. coli MG1655 and E. coli Nissle 1917. The phenotypic effects of the P41L missense mutation in the E. coli MG1655 envZ gene (envZP41L) reported previously were consistent with it containing a higher level of OmpRP than that in E. coli MG1655 (3). In order to test this possibility, we examined OmpRP levels in these strains. At low osmolality, the wild-type E. coli MG1655 strain had no detectable OmpRP, and at high osmolality, the OmpRP level in the wildtype strain was barely detectable (Fig. 2A). In contrast, E. coli MG1655 envZP41L exhibited an extremely high level of OmpRP at low osmolality that did not appear to increase further at high osmolality (Fig. 2A). P148S and V33E mutants behaved similarly (Fig. 2A). The elevated levels of OmpRP observed in the E. coli MG1655 envZ mutant strains even at low osmolality (Fig. 2A) suggested that OmpC levels should also be elevated (10). We prepared outer membranes and examined the porin content of cells grown at low and high osmolalities (Fig. 2B). As expected (10), in the wild-type strain, OmpF was the major porin at low osmolalityFIG 1 Colonization of the mouse intestine by E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 envZNis.

(Fig. 2B), and OmpC was the major porin at high osmolality (Fig. 2B). In the P41L background, OmpC was present at low osmolality, and OmpF was completely absent (Fig. 2B). OmpF expression was normal in the P41L strain restored to the wild type (Fig. 2B). The P148S and V33E mutants behaved similarly to the P41L strain (Fig. 2B). Thus, the E. coli MG1655 envZ missense mutants express OmpC at low osmolality and repress OmpF, consistent with the elevated OmpRP levels shown in Fig. 2A (10). We were next interested in determining whether envZP41L would have the same effect on E. coli Nissle 1917 and therefore replaced the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene with envZP41L to create E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L. Indeed, envZP41L had the same effect in E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L as in E. coli MG1655 envZP41L, i.e., under conditions of low osmolality, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L contained a much higher level of OmpRP than E. coli Nissle 1917 (Fig. 3A) and, as a result, a higher level of OmpC and a far lower level of OmpF in its outer membrane (Fig. 3B). Effects of envZP41L on E. coli Nissle 1917 motility, sensitivity to bile salts and colicin V, and growth rate on galactose. The mutant envZP41L gene in E. coli MG1655 envZP41L causes it to be less motile than E. coli MG1655, because the higher level of OmpRP negatively regulates production of FlhD4C2, the master regulator of flagellum biosynthesis (12). E. coli MG1655 envZP41L is more resistant to bile salts than E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 flhD, because higher levels of OmpRP negatively regulate production of OmpF, the porin that transports bile salts (33) (Fig. 2B). A higher level of OmpRP also causes E. coli MG1655 envZP41L to be more resistant to colicin V than E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 flhD, because OmpRP positively regulates the transcription of omrA and omrB, which encode two small RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of a number of outer membrane proteins, including CirA, the receptor for colicin V (13). Finally, for as yet unknown reasons, the envZP41L gene causes E. coli MG1655 envZP41L to grow 30% faster on galactose as the sole carbon and energy source than E. coli MG1655 and E. coli MG1655 flhD (3). We were interested in determining whether envZP41L would have the same effect on E. coli Nissle 1917, and therefore E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L and E. coli Nissle 1917 were tested for motility, resistance to bile salts, resistance to colicin V, and growth rate on galactose. Indeed, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was less motile (Table 2), more resistant to colicin V (Table 2), and more resistant to bile salts than E. coli Nissle 1917 (Fig. 4). However, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L grew about 15% slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 on galactose (Table 3). Still, three of the four phenotypic characteristics ascribed to the envZP41L gene were transferred to E. coli Nissle 1917. The hypothesis that the phenotypic changes in E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L were due to the envZP41L gene was supFIG 3 (A) OmpRP levels in E. coli Nissle 1917 (wt), Nissle 1917 envZP41L, and Nissle 1917 envZP41L restored to the wild type.

Growth of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L on a variety of sugars present in mucus in vitro. We previously reported that E. coli MG1655 envZP41L grew slower than E. coli MG1655 flhD on arabinose, fucose, glucose, maltose, and mannose, at the same rate as E. coli MG1655 flhD on fructose, gluconate, and ribose, and faster than E. coli MG1655 flhD on galactose and N-acetylglucosamine (3). In contrast, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L did not grow faster than E. coli Nissle 1917 on any of the sugars tested and grew slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 on a number of sugars, i.e., with doubling times about 15% greater than that of E. coli Nissle 1917 on galactose, 10% greater on gluconate, 40% greater on maltose, and 30% greater on mannose (Table 3). Apparently, the effect of envZP41L on sugar metabolism is strain specific. Of the sugars tested, E. coli Nissle 1917 is known to use arabinose, fucose, galactose, gluconate, and mannose to colonize the streptomycintreated mouse large intestine (34). Growth of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L in cecal mucus in vitro. E. coli colonizes the intestine by growing in intestinal mucus (35, 36), which contains at least 13 different sugars that can be used by E. coli as sole sources of carbon. When E. coli MG1655 and E. coli Nissle 1917 colonize the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine, they simultaneously metabolize a number of these sugars (37, 38). Colonization requires bacteria to penetrate the mucus layer, compete for nutrients with the microbiota, and divide at a rate that is at least equal to the washout rate caused by sloughing of the mucus layer into feces (35, 36). We previously reported that despite being as good an intestinal colonizer, E. coli MG1655 envZP41L grew 15% slower than E. coli MG1655 flhD in mouse cecal mucus in vitro (3). Even more dramatically, the doubling time of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was twice that of E. coli Nissle 1917 in mouse cecal mucus in standing cultures in vitro (Table 3), i.e., it grew far slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 (P 0.001). E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L is a better mouse intestinal colonizer than E. coli Nissle 1917. Since E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L grew slower than E. coli Nissle on a number of sugars present in cecal mucus and in cecal mucus itself in vitro, it would be expected that if colonizing ability was based solely on the ability of a strain to utilize sugars present in mucus for growth, E. coli Nissle envZP41L would be the poorer colonizer. Yet E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was about a 10-fold better colonizer than wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 when 105 CFU of each strain was fed to mice (P  3.49  107) (Fig. 5A). The hypothesis that the better colonizing ability of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was due to the envZP41L gene was supported by the fact that when the envZP41L gene in E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was replaced with the wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene, the restored E. coli Nissle 1917 and wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 strains had identical colonizing abilities (P  0.16) (Fig. 5B). We found previously that despite E. coli MG1655 envZP41L growing about 15% slower than E. coli MG1655 flhD in mouse cecal mucus in vitro, large numbers of E. coli MG1655 envZP41L (1010 CFU) prevented small numbers of E. coli MG1655 flhD (105 CFU) from growing to larger numbers in the mouse intestine, whereas small numbers of E. coli MG1655 envZP41L were able to grow to larger numbers in the presence of large numbers of E. coli MG1655 flhD (3). Similarly, despite E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L growing far slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 in mouse cecal mucus in vitro and on a number of sugars present in mucus, large numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L prevented small numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 from growing to larger numbers in the mouse intestine (Fig. 5C), suggesting that E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L resides in and competes effectively in all intestinal niches occupied by E. coli Nissle 1917. In contrast, despite its growing 50% slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 in mouse cecal mucus in vitro, small numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L grew to larger numbers in the presence of large numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 (Fig. 5D), suggesting that E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L resides in at least one intestinal niche that E. coli Nissle 1917 fails to colonize or colonizes poorly. Moreover, the growth of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L from small to large numbers in the presence of large numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 was not restricted to the mucus layer of any one section of the intestine, i.e., it did so in ileal mucus, cecal mucus, and colonic mucus in vivo (Table 4). E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L uses galactose to grow from small to large numbers in vivo in the presence of large numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917. Previously we showed that E. coli MG1655 envZP41L, which grows 30% faster than E. coli MG1655 on galactose, uses galactose to grow from small to large numbers in the mouse intestine in the presence of large numbers of E. coli MG1655 flhD (3). Here we show that E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L also uses galactose to grow from small to large numbers in the mouse intestine in the presence of large numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917, despite growing 15% slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 in vitro on galactose (Table 3). That is, small numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L galK failed to grow to larger numbers in the presence of large numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 (Fig. 6A), whereas small numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 galK restored to the wild type with respect to galactose utilization did so (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L uses galactose to colonize an inTABLE 3 Generation times of E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L on various sugars a Carbon sourceb Mean generation time (min)  SD (n  3) E. coli Nissle 1917 E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L c Arabinose 66  1 64  1* Fructose 96  4 99  1** Fucose 83  1 79  4** Galactose 69  1 81  4*** Gluconate 61  2 67  1*** Glucose 89  2 92  2** Maltose 85  3 120  2**** Mannose 129  7 164  7† N-Acetylglucosamine 84  1 83  1** Ribose 104  7 108  8** Cecal mucus 52  3 100  3**** a Generation times were calculated from semilogarithmic plots. b Carbon source utilization was determined in M9 minimal medium (0.4% [wt/vol]) in 125-ml tissue culture flasks with shaking after inocula were grown on M9 glycerol (0.4% [vol/vol]) and then overnight on the specified carbon source. c Each P value refers to a comparison between the generation times of E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L growing on a specific sugar: *, P 0.05; **, P 0.10; ***, P 0.05; ****, P 0.001; †, P  0.0036.

E. coli Nissle 1917 resides closely associated with other members of the microbiota in the mouse intestine. Since commensal E. coli strains colonize the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine by growing in the intestinal mucus layer of the large intestine (35, 36), and since it has been shown that E. coli MG1655 resides in mixed biofilms in the mouse cecal mucus layer (3), we examined whether E. coli Nissle 1917 also resides in mixed biofilms in mucus in vivo. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 7A, E. coli Nissle 1917 appears to reside in the cecal mucus layer, closely associated with other members of the microbiota. As expected, E. coli was not found in the cecal mucus of mice not fed E. coli Nissle 1917 (Fig. 7B). Protection against E. coli EDL933 colonization by E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L. Different resident commensal E. coli strains vary by as much as 10,000-fold with respect to the level of colonization of the prototypic enterohemorrhagic E. coli strain EDL933 that they allow in the streptomycintreated mouse intestine (38). Among several commensal strains previously tested, E. coli Nissle 1917 was one of the best at limiting E. coli EDL933 colonization, i.e., in mice precolonized with E. coli Nissle 1917 and then fed 105 CFU of E. coli EDL933 10 days later, E. coli EDL933 dropped from 105 CFU/g of feces and colonized at a level between 103 and 104 CFU/g of feces (39). While this level of colonization is low, as long as the relatively few E. coli EDL933 cells are healthy and able to persist in the intestine at that low level, they might also be able to initiate the pathogenic process in humans by damaging the mucosa, resulting in subsequent disease. It was therefore of interest to determine whether E. coli Nissle 1917 FIG 5 Colonization of the mouse intestine by E. coli Nissle 1917, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L, and E. coli Nissle envZP41L restored to the wild type.

In fact, although not statistically significant, it appeared that E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was not quite as effective as E. coli Nissle 1917 in limiting E. coli EDL933 growth in the intestine (compare Fig. 8A and B). DISCUSSION When a bacterial species persists indefinitely in stable numbers in the intestine of an animal, without repeated introduction, the animal is, by definition, colonized by the bacterium. Commensal E. coli strains colonize the human intestine in the presence of a dense and diverse intestinal microbiota comprised of at least 500 cultivable species and 1013 to 1014 total bacteria (40). Unfortunately, E. coli colonization cannot be studied experimentally in conventional animals due to colonization resistance, which results when all niches are filled by the microbiota (41). Such experiments require an animal model with open niches for E. coli to colonize in relatively large numbers, but the animal model intestine should have a dense and diverse anaerobic community that matches as closely as possible the native microbiota of the conventional animal in order to examine interactions among members of the microbiota. The streptomycin-treated mouse model is used routinely for this purpose because it fulfills these criteria (35, 36).

This study was undertaken to determine whether the envZP41L gene, selected in E. coli MG1655 by the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine (3), would make the probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 a better mouse intestine colonizer and better able to resist colonization by E. coli EDL933, an enterohemorrhagic strain. The data presented here clearly show that despite being a 10-fold better colonizer than E. coli Nissle 1917 and despite appearing to colonize an intestinal niche not colonized by E. coli Nissle 1917, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L is not better than E. coli Nissle 1917 at limiting E. coli EDL933 growth in the intestine (Fig. 8). The concept that nutrient availability dictates the community structure of the intestine was originally presented in Freter’s nutrient-niche hypothesis, which states that species coexist in the intestine because each is able to grow faster than all others on one or a few limiting nutrients and that the rate of growth of each species during the colonization process is at least equal to its washout rate from the intestine (42). The hypothesis assumes that all nutrients are perfectly mixed and that they are equally available to all species present in the intestine. According to the hypothesis, two strains cannot coexist in the intestine when one competes less well than the other for the same nutrient(s), unless the metabolically less efficient one adheres to the intestinal wall (42). As a corollary to the hypothesis, when two strains each use one or more major nutrients better than the other strain, small numbers of each strain will grow up in the intestine to larger numbers in the presence of large numbers of the other strain, as observed in mouse colonization studies using a number of human fecal E. coli strains isolated from different humans (39). Despite general acceptance of the nutrient-niche hypothesis, recent data suggest that it is not entirely correct for E. coli (3). We recently reported that E. coli MG1655 envZP41L, selected by the mouse intestine as a better colonizer than E. coli MG1655, colonizes as well as E. coli MG1655 flhD, also a better colonizer selected by the mouse intestine, but grows less well than E. coli MG1655 flhD in bacterium-free mouse cecal mucus in vitro and on several sugars present in cecal mucus (3). These results were in contrast to what would be expected if the nutrient-niche hypothesis were entirely correct as discussed above. Furthermore, E. coli requires monoand disaccharides for growth in the intestine (35, 36), but monoand disaccharides present in the diet are unlikely to be available to E. coli because they are absorbed in the small intestine. The anaerobes in the intestine secrete polysaccharide hydrolases (43), but E. coli cannot do so (44, 45). Indeed, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which is in the same family as E. coli and has a very similar metabolism, catabolizes fucose and sialic acid liberated from mucosal polysaccharides by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (46). It therefore is clear that E. coli obtains the bulk of the monoand disaccharides it requires for growth in the intestine from degradation of dietary fiber-derived and mucinderived polysaccharides by anaerobes. In view of this information and since we found that E. coli MG1655 resides in mixed biofilms in the mucus layer of the intestine but does not appear to adhere to the intestinal wall, to explain our findings we suggested the “restaurant hypothesis” as a modification to the nutrient-niche hypothesis (3). According to the restaurant hypothesis, the monoand disaccharides that E. coli requires for growth are not derived from the diet and are not perfectly mixed in the intestine but are served locally to E. coli by the anaerobes within the mixed biofilms that E. coli inhabits. The restaurant hypothesis also raises the possibility that E. coli strains with different surfaces (e.g., fimbriae, capsule, O, K, and H antigens, outer membrane protein profiles, etc.) might reside in mixed biofilms made up of different anaerobes that supply different sugars to those strains, which could explain why different E. coli strains display different nutritional programs in the intestine despite using the same sugars when cultured in vitro (38, 39). The data presented here are also consistent with the restaurant hypothesis. E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L did not grow faster than E. coli Nissle 1917 on any of the sugars present in mucus that were tested, grew 10% to 30% slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 on several of the sugars tested, and grew 50% slower in cecal mucus in vitro in which all nutrients were perfectly mixed, i.e., in UV-sterilized cecal mucus that had been centrifuged free of bacteria (Table 3). Yet in contrast to what would be expected solely on the basis of competition for nutrients from a mixture that is equally available to all, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L colonized the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine 10-fold better in competition with E. coli Nissle 1917 (Fig. 5A) and grew from small to large numbers in the mouse intestine in the presence of large numbers of E. coli Nissle 1917 (Fig. 5D). Although these data cannot be explained solely by the nutrientFIG 8 E. coli EDL933 colonization of the mouse intestine precolonized with either E. coli Nissle 1917 or E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L. (A) Three sets of three mice were fed 105 CFU of E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr Nalr (Œ) and, 10 days later, were fed 105 CFU of E. coli EDL933 Strr Rifr (). (B) Three sets of three mice were fed 105 CFU of E. coli Nissle 1917 Strr Nalr envZP41L () and, 10 days later, were fed 105 CFU of E. coli EDL933 Strr Rifr (). Data were collected and plotted as described in the legend to Fig. 4.

If so, then it is not surprising that when E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L and wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 are fed to mice in equal numbers, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L is the better colonizer (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, it is not surprising that when mice are fed E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L and wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 at a ratio of 10 5:1, the ratio reaches 106:1 with time (Fig. 5C). However, it is surprising that when mice are fed wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L at a ratio of 10 5:1, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L uses galactose to grow to larger numbers (Fig. 5D and 6A), despite wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 being able to grow faster than E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L on galactose in vitro (Table 3). This can be explained if E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L uses galactose to grow in a second niche that wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 cannot colonize. That second niche could be another mixed biofilm consisting of a different group of anaerobes in which E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L has a higher affinity for binding sites than E. coli Nissle 1917 and thereby prevents it from occupying that niche. Alternatively, that second niche could be another mixed biofilm that contains an anaerobe that makes a bacteriocin that inhibits wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 growth more than it inhibits E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L growth, much in the same way that E. coli Nissle 1917 is more sensitive than wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 to colicin V (Table 2). To reiterate, we emphasize that the envZP41L mutation, when transferred from E. coli MG1655 envZP41L into E. coli Nissle 1917, directs E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L to occupy a distinct niche in which it is served galactose (Fig. 5D), just as it does in E. coli MG1655 envZP41L (3). Moreover, occupation of the galactose niche gives E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L a colonization advantage, despite its growing more slowly on galactose than the wild type in vitro. We consider this to be strong evidence for the restaurant hypothesis. In support of the view that surface differences between E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L and E. coli Nissle 1917 could result in different binding affinities for mixed biofilms, when we replaced the envZNis gene in E. coli Nissle 1917 with envZP41L, three phenotypic changes observed in E. coli MG1655 envZP41L, caused by outer membrane changes resulting from increased OmpRP, were transferred to E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L. These surface changes, i.e., decreased OmpF and increased OmpC (Fig. 3), decreased CirA causing increased resistance to colicin V (3, 13) (Table 2), and decreased motility (Table 2) caused by the negative regulatory effect of increased OmpRP on the flhDC promoter (12), could contribute to an increased affinity for binding sites in a mixed biofilm. It has been shown that decreased motility favors biofilm formation following the initial adhesion event (47) and that OmpC can serve as an adhesin (48). It should also be mentioned that increased OmpRP (Fig. 1) has been shown to stimulate production of curli fibers that also stimulate biofilm formation (49). It therefore seems reasonable that E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L could have a higher affinity than E. coli Nissle 1917 for binding sites on a mixed biofilm. At this time, we do not know why despite being a better colonizer than E. coli Nissle 1917, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L is not better at limiting E. coli EDL933 colonization than E. coli Nissle 1917; however, the possibility should be considered that when E. coli EDL933 infects the mouse intestine, it initially grows planktonically in mucus and not in mixed biofilms. If we are correct that E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L colonize the mouse intestine by being served specific sugars by the anaerobes in the mixed biofilms they inhabit, then small amounts of these sugars that escape the mixed biofilms might be available to invading E. coli EDL933 as well as to the small numbers of planktonic E. coli Nissle 1917 or E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L that leave the mixed biofilms. Therefore, it may be that both planktonic E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L and E. coli Nissle 1917 compete directly with planktonic E. coli EDL933 for the sugars that escape the biofilms or that are produced by small numbers of planktonic members of the rest of the microbiota that leave the biofilms. This scenario would allow planktonic E. coli EDL933 to colonize to the extent allowed by the available concentrations of those sugars in competition with planktonic E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L or E. coli Nissle 1917, which could explain why E. coli Nissle 1917, the faster grower in perfectly mixed mucus, appears to limit E. coli EDL933 growth in the intestine more than E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L does (Fig. 8). In summary, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L is a 10-fold better mouse intestinal colonizer than E. coli Nissle 1917, despite growing far slower than E. coli Nissle 1917 in bacterium-free, perfectly mixed cecal mucus in vitro and on several sugars present in mucus, yet it is not better at limiting E. coli EDL933 colonization. The data presented here are consistent with the restaurant hypothesis for commensal E. coli strains that colonize the intestine as members of mixed biofilms and obtain the sugars they need for growth locally (3). Indeed, introduction of an envZP41L mutation into either of two E. coli commensal strains directs the mutants to a niche that is defined at least in part by the availability of galactose and cannot be occupied by the parent strains. However, it may be that it is not sessile E. coli but the small number of planktonic E. coli cells that compete for sugars with invading E. coli pathogens. If so, then an efficacious E. coli probiotic agent not only should be able to inhabit mixed biofilms better than its parent and, as such, be a better colonizer but also should be better at utilizing nutrients for growth to outcompete the invading pathogen.
