"Slow Lorises (Nycticebus spp.) Really Are Slow: a Study of Food Passage Rates Francis Cabana1,2 & Ellen Dierenfeld3 & Wirdateti Wirdateti4 & Giuseppe Donati1 & K. A. I. Nekaris1 Received: 29 November 2016 /Accepted: 10 July 2017 /Published online: 2 September 2017 # Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2017 Abstract The characteristics of food ingested by a primate affect its assimilation of energy by modulating food passage rate. In general, digestive time increases in folivorous primates and decreases in frugivorous primates when they are fed higher fiber diets but this relationship is understudied in exudativorous primates. We compared the food passage rate of five slow loris species. We studied 34 wild-caught slow lorises (15 Nycticebus coucang, 15 N. javanicus, and 4 N. menegensis) in an Indonesian rescue center and four captive-born slow lorises (2 N. bengalensis and 2 N. pygmaeus) in a UK institution. We fed the Indonesian subjects two different diets: a captive-type diet comprising fruits, vegetables, and insects and a wild-type diet formulated to be similar in nutrients to that consumed by slow lorises in the wild, consisting of gum, insects, vegetables, and nectar. We fed the UK subjects a diet of gum, vegetables, insects, and hard-boiled eggs. We formulated this diet to mimic the wild diet, with notably higher fiber fractions and lower soluble sugars than the previous diet. We measured two variables: the transit time (TT) and the mean retention time (MRT). We mixed 1 tsp. of glitter in bananas or gum as our markers and fed them to the slow lorises immediately before their main diet. We noted the date and time of feeding and of appearances of the marker in feces. We weighed food given and left over for each individual to Int J Primatol (2017) 38:900–913 DOI 10.1007/s10764-017-9986-5 Handling Editor: Joanna M.

We found that TTs were not affected by diet treatment but MRTs were significantly longer for all species fed the wild-type diet. Our results show that Nycticebus spp. have long MRTs for their body weight, and N. pygmdaeus may have the slowest MRT of all primates in relation to body mass. The digestive flexibility of exudativorous primates should allow them to maximize fermentation opportunities when they ingest more (appropriate) fiber by increasing the amount of time the fiber substrate stays in the large intestine. Exudativorous primates appear to have plastic digestive strategies that may be an adaptation to cope with relatively nutrient-poor staple food sources such as gum. The provision of gum in a captive setting may therefore provide benefits for gut health in slow lorises. Keywords Diet . Exudativory . Gum .Mean retention time . Primate . Transit time Introduction Obtaining energy is a fundamental task of all animals, and underlies a finely tuned relationship between food composition and digestive ability. An animal’s food passage rate varies with the nutrients ingested to maximize energetic gains. Obtaining energy from plant fibers (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, etc.) requires fermentation by microbes in the digestive systems of some animals. A fast passage rate may not allow enough time for the microbes to release a valuable amount of energy. The length of time food remains inside the gastrointestinal tract of an animal can influence many interrelated biological functions, such as the concentration and composition of intestinal microflora (Bailey and Coe 2002; Fogel 2015), extent of nutrient breakdown and absorption (Flores Miyamoto et al. 2005), energetic yield (Blaine and Lambert 2012), metabolic rate (Müller et al. 2013), and detoxification of secondary plant metabolites (Cork and Foley 1991). Depending on the food ingested, some mammal species modulate this rate of passage (Edwards and Ullrey 1999a; Kuijper et al. 2004) to enhance the digestibility of poor-quality food, speed up the intake of food items high in easily digestible nutrients (Caton et al. 1996; Sawada et al. 2011), or eliminate nondigestible food items (Dierenfeld et al. 1982; Power 2010). Measurements used to estimate the food passage rate include transit time (TT) and mean retention time (MRT) (Warner 1981). MRT values are difficult to measure in wild animals, so researchers use MRT in captive animals to infer information about the wild ecological niche, revealing information about energetic needs and digestive ecology (Blaine and Lambert 2012; Lambert 1999, 2002). When primates undergo changes in their feeding regimes, changes in MRT values can be grossly predicted depending on feeding ecology and gastrointestinal tract anatomy. The MRTs of foregut fermenting folivorous proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) or hindgut fermenting folivorous gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) differ from those of poorly fermenting frugivores such as red ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra) or granivorous white-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia pithecia: Remis and Dierenfeld 2004; Dierenfeld et al. 1992; Edwards and Ullrey 1999b). Changes in MRT may in part be caused by plant fiber in the diets of species with different feeding ecologies and the relative importance of fiber to their overall energy balance. The folivorous colobine primates have the longest absolute MRTs (up to 49 h; Nijboer 2006), and folivorous Slow Lorises (Nycticebus spp.) Really are Slow: a Study into Food... 901 hindgut fermenters vary greatly in their digestive capabilities and MRT, ranging from 12 to 37 h (Edwards and Ullrey 1999b). Such results are not surprising because colobine primates ingest foods high in fiber content compared to noncolobines, and must have a long MRT to allow their symbiotic microbes enough contact time to convert the cellulose and hemicellulose fibers into energy sources. Frugivorous species such as spider monkeys (Ateles spp.), in contrast, do not exploit the fibrous portions of their diets to the same extent as the soluble carbohydrates found in fruit and therefore do not require extended retention (Milton 1980). Numerous comparisons between the passage rates of frugivorous vs. folivorous primates are available, but it is still difficult to draw general conclusions about primates of the same feeding ecology archetypes in relation to body mass (Lambert 1998). Much of our understanding of exudativory (most notably tree gum eaters) in primates is based on the New World marmosets, which gouge trees throughout the year and trigger production of gum that they harvest the next day or night (Isbell et al. 2013; Nash 1986; Smith 2010). Both the marmosets and the less-studied exudativorous slow lorises (Nycticebus spp.) possess gastrointestinal tract anatomies, i.e., enlarged cecae, associated with digestion/fermentation of soluble polysaccharides found within tree gums (Coimbra-Filha and Mittermeier 1977; Ushida et al. 2006). This may be why marmosets decrease their food passage rates when they feed on gum (Power and Oftedal 1996). Gums are also high in minerals, particularly calcium, and once fermented, they provide a concentrated source of energy; however, they are low in most other nutrients such as protein and lipids (Hladik 1979; Isbell et al. 2013). Among exudativores, Callithrix jacchus has a longer MRT to accommodate the opportunity for fermentation and energy gain (Power and Oftedal 1996). Studies of MRT in relation to exudativory have been limited to New World primates (Platyrrhini), despite the prevalence of this diet among the Strepsirrhini, notably the nocturnal slow lorises. Recent research shows that exudates play a vital role across slow loris species in the wild (Nycticebus pygmaeus, N. coucang, N. bengalensis – all Vulnerable, and N. javanicus – Critically Endangered), with these taxa spending 43–87% of feeding time on exudates (Cabana et al. 2017; Das et al. 2014; Starr and Nekaris 2013; Wiens et al. 2006). In the past, Nycticebus spp. were classified as frugivores based on limited observations and comparisons to African pottos (Perodicticus: Barrett 1984; Charles-Dominique 1977). This misconception has led zoos and rescue centres to feed slow lorises diets comprising largely fruits, a practice that has been implicated in reduced reproduction and a high incidence of diseases, most notably dental and renal diseases (Cabana 2014; Cabana and Nekaris 2015; Debyser 1995; Fuller et al. 2013; Fuller et al. 2014). We aimed to compare the TT and MRT of five slow loris species (Nycticebus coucang, N. javanicus, N. menagensis, N. bengalensis, N. pygmaeus) fed a traditional captive diet and a diet formulated to resemble wild diets to further understand the digestive strategy of exudativorous primates. We predicted that slow lorises should show an MRT response similar to that of common marmosets, namely increasing their MRT as fiber fractions in the form of gum in the diet is increased. We also compiled published primate TT and MRT values for comparison with our data. 902 Cabana F. et al. Methods Study Subjects and Locations We conducted the study at two locations. The first was Cikananga Wildlife Rescue Centre (CWRC), in Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia. Slow lorises housed at the center and used in the study were Nycticebus coucang (N = 15), N. javanicus (N = 15), and N. menagensis (N = 4). All animals at CWRC were wild born and had been at the center for 14–20 mo. We could not estimate the age of these individuals; all were housed in single-sex groups. We performed the second set of trials at Shaldon Wildlife Trust (SWT), Shaldon, UK, with N. pygmaeus (N = 2) and N. bengalensis (N = 2). Both N. pygmaeus were captive born, and both N. bengalensis were wild born. SWT housed all animal subjects of this study individually; veterinarians deemed animals healthy and kept them in nonbreeding situations. Estimation of Nutrient Intake We estimated the nutrient intake of captive slow lorises fed two different diets. We quantified foods consumed by each slow loris as well as the uneaten foods the following morning using the methods of Britt et al. (2015). The captive diet at the CWRC was their current diet, comprising (on average per individual): katydids (Scudderia spp.: 3.4 g), peeled oranges (18.3 g), peeled banana (44.0 g), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor: 4.9 g), crickets (Acheta domestica: 1.3 g), peeled rambutans (Nephelium lappaceum: 12.2 g), hardboiled chicken egg without shell (2.2 g), sapodilla without seeds (Manilkara zapota: 17.1 g), honey (4.0 g), mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana: 12.9 g), and sago worms (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus: 2.1 g). We weighed the food before giving it to the subjects, and weighed any uneaten food in the enclosure the following morning at 07:00 h. We also set up desiccation dishes of food items and measured them at feeding time and the following morning at 07:00 h. We filled them with the food items we gave the subjects and kept them in a pest-proof area with the same temperature and climate as the enclosures. We attributed the decrease in weight to evaporation, which allowed us to correct the diet intake values for this. We based the wild-type diet on a year-long ecological study of Javan slow lorises (Cabana et al. 2017). The wild-type diet consisted of 20 g of various insects (including mealworms, crickets, wild caught katydids, sago worm larvae, and pupae mix), carrots (10 g), green beans (10 g), young bamboo leaves (Gigantochloa cf. ater: 5 g), and gum directly from Acacia decurrens trees (20 g). We changed the captive type diet to the wild-type diet progressively over 7 days. We then allowed 7 days for acclimatization and collected data over the following 7 days. We used only food items that were affordable and available at the rescue center and zoo. We analyzed the components of both CWRC diets for primary nutrients and fiber fractions (moisture, ash, crude protein, crude fat, acid detergent fiber [ADF], neutral detergent fiber [NDF], soluble fiber, and soluble sugars) at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia [LIPI]) Nutrition Laboratory using methods described in Cabana et al. (2017). Slow Lorises (Nycticebus spp.) Really are Slow: a Study into Food... 903 The SWT diet consisted of 50 g of vegetables (broccoli, peppers, cucumber), 50 g of various root vegetables (carrots, sweet potato, parsnip, swede), 2 g of nectar powder (Sunbird Nectar, Mazuri Europe, UK), 3 g of locusts (Schistocerca gregaria), 3 g of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), 1/2 hardboiled egg with shell, and 5 g of gum arabic powder from Annona senegalensis. Food Passage Rate We used the methods described by Lambert (2002) to determine TT and MRT. Initially, we hid nontoxic plastic beads in bananas, guava, and gum to use as the marker to calculate the TT and MRT by noting the time the beads were fed to subjects and the time they appeared in feces, but the slow lorises used their sublinguals (used to clean out their dental comb) to remove and spit out the beads. We then used glitter (unknown brand, Indonesia), previously described by Fuller et al. (2011) as a successful TT and MRT marker. To validate the glitter technique for slow lorises, we put it inside guavas and compared the TT and MRT of the guava seeds vs. glitter in the same individuals of Nycticebus javanicus. Results were identical: TT of 24.00 ± 2.25 h (SD) and MRT of 32.25 h ± 4.66. We then tried 5.0 g of glitter inside a banana in the captive diet, and in 10 g of gum for the wild-type diet at CWRC and at SWT. We gave each individual the same amount of glitter. We always fed subjects the markers first, before the rest of the diet. At CWRC we fed the slow lorises markers at 18:00 h when they awoke, and at SWT we fed slow lorises at 08:00 h because of the reversed light cycle of their nocturnal enclosures. After the slow lorises awoke, we checked each enclosure hourly and collected all feces we could locate. If we found glitter in the feces, we recorded the name of the individual and the time we found the marker. We alternated glitter colors (red and blue) between trials. We conducted four trials for each individual for each diet; trials lasted until we observed no more markers in the feces and one extra day, making all trials 4 days long. We defined the time between ingestion of the marker and its first appearance as TT, and we used MRT as the best estimate of food movement through the gastrointestinal tract (Warner 1981). We calculated this value by dividing the length of time from ingestion to each occurrence of the marker, divided by the total number of separate feces with markers present for that trial (Lambert 2002). We took the mean of the four trials per individual to calculate individual MRT values. We compiled the TT and MRT values of primates thus far for comparison between other species (Electronic Supplementary Material Table SI). We plotted MRT values against body mass and labeled species with their gross ecological feeding niche (folivore, frugivore, exudativore, or granivore). We labeled generalist species and those with heavily seasonal diets frugivores. Statistical Analysis We conducted all statistical analyses using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM). We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to test for main effects of species and diet composition on the TT and MRT. We considered the assumptions associated with GLMMs and did not violate them. We used a gamma distribution for the response variables (TT and MRT), individual as a random factor and diet (captive and wild), and 904 Cabana F. et al. the three species (Nycticebus coucang, N. javanicus, and N. menagensis) as fixed factors. We did not use data from SWT in this analysis because the animals received only the SWT diet. We also performed a Wilcoxon signed rank test, comparing the nutrient concentrations ingested each CWRC slow loris when fed the captive diet and the wild diet. Ethical Note We received ethical clearance from the Oxford Brookes University (UK) Social Sciences Department Ethics Committee. F. Cabana obtained an Indonesian research visa for this research from the Indonesian government (Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia). Subjects were already captive and we did not handle them any more than usual. We expected the diet manipulations to lead to healthier and more naturalistic diets and thus we did not consider them to be a significant stress or danger to the lorises. The authors declare no conflict of interest in relation to this study. Results Transit and Mean Retention Times The mean TT for CWRC Nycticebus spp. on the captive type diet ranged 24.2–25.6 h, and on the wild type diet ranged 24.4–25.9 h (Table I).

SWT slow lorises had TTs of 25.3–29 h and MRTs of 42.6–58 h. The TT was not affected by any variables we tested (overall model: χ2 = 77.549, df = 271, P = 0.0001; diet χ2 = 1.647, df = 1, P = 0.199; species χ2 = 54.528, df = 2, P = 0.608) but for MRT (overall model: (χ2 = 211.394, df = 271, P = 0.0001) both diet (χ2 = 710.276, df = 1, P = 0.0001) and species (χ2 = 17.531, df = 2, P = 0.0001) had a significant effect. The captive type diet was associated with a significantly shorter MRT overall (B = −4.750, df = 1, P = 0.0001). The MRTs of both N. javanicus (B = 4.600, df = 2, P = 0.0001) and N. coucang (B = 4.000, df = 2, P = 0.0001) were ca. 4 h longer than N. menagensis fed the wild-type diet. When we gave subjects the captive diet, we recorded significantly shorter MRT values for N. coucang than for other species on this diet (B = −4.000, df = 1, P = 0.001). Exudativores had the steepest line of best fit (y = 40.45×) in our scatterplot of MRT and body mass values, followed by granivores (y = 21.87×, although this was represented by only two samples), then folivores (y = 6.80×), and finally frugivores (y = 4.03×). These values should be used as loose comparisons only, as species were fed different diets that may alter their TT or MRT. Nutrients Ingested by Slow Lorises The mean nutrient values ingested by slow lorises fed the captive-type diet at CWRC were different from those in the wild type diet (Table II). At SWT, Nycticebus pygmaeus and N. bengalensis had fiber intake concentrations (DMB) of 9.2–12.3% (ADF) and 12.0–13.6% (NDF). Our Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that all nutrients ingested except iron were significantly different between the captive and wild diets (Table III). Discussion The food passage rate of Nycticebus spp. was relatively long for their body mass compared to other primates. They showed a digestive response similar to that of leaf-eating monkeys (Colobinae), in which MRT increased with fiber intake. This response is also comparable to that of exudativorous marmosets when dietary fiber intake increases (Power and Oftedal 1996). The wild-type diet increased MRT by up to 42% but did not change TT values. The two different diets led to significantly different nutrient concentrations being ingested for every nutrient except iron, which also reflects how different captive diets can be to wild slow loris diets. The TT of the slow lorises did not vary with diet. Their long MRTs (ranging 29.70–33.40 h) increased by 4–29% when fed the wild-type diet. This diet contained significantly more fiber fractions (soluble fiber, ADF, and NDF), which may be the major reason underlying this altered gut passage rate. The SWT diet contained gum arabic, insects (crickets and mealworms), eggs, vegetables, and fruit, effectively making it a hybrid of the captive and wild-type diets, but the dietary fiber values were closer to the wild-type diet. We did not have data to test whether MRT in N. pygmaeus or N. bengalensis increases if they are fed a higher fiber diet but we can compare their MRT values with those of other Nycticebus 906 Cabana F. et al.

Our results are nonetheless useful for comparisons and to influence captive care owing to the dearth of knowledge about physiology of Nycticebus. Strepsirrhines that depend on fermentable foods, such as leaves, have an enlarged large intestine and cecum, e.g., the sportive lemur Lepilemur leucopus (Perrin 2013). This anatomy most likely reflects an adaptation for efficient use of high-fiber diets and active microbial populations. Slow lorises also appear to possess adaptations to highfiber diets, reflected in the large increase in MRT when we fed them wild-type diets. Within the platyrrhines, howlers (Allouatta spp.) also eat a very fibrous diet and display TTs of 20.4–35.0 h and MRTs of 49.5–57.0 h, in contrast with 5.3 h in the frugivorous spider monkeys (Ateles spp.: Crissey et al. 1990; Espinosa-Gómez et al. 2013; Milton 1984). This enables spider monkeys to pass indigestible materials rapidly through their less complex digestive tract, similar to tamarin species which pass whole undigested seeds within 2.2–2.5 h (Heymann and Smith 1999; Knogge 1998). This response allows frugivores to ingest more food and exploit the easily absorbable nutrients in the diet faster than folivores. This also explains why frugivores had the lowest MRT to body size ratio. If preferred foods are not available in large quantity, a higher intake of lesser quality food may compensate. This strategy is useful for frugivorous tamarins (Saguinus spp.), spider monkeys, Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar), and de Brazza’s monkeys (Cercopithecus neglectus), which show decreased MRTs with increasing dietary fiber (Sawada et al. 2011). The dichotomy between the folivorous and frugivorous responses is further exemplified in the lemurs (Lemuridae). Frugivorous lemurs (Eulemur spp.) have a rapid TT of 1.6–3.3 h, but the fermenting eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus) has a much longer TT of 18.2 h (Overdorff and Rasmussen 1995). Data for great apes also support this hypothesis. The more frugivorous orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and chimpanzee (Pan Table III Wilcoxon signed rank test results comparing the nutrient intake of 34 slow lorises (Nycticebus javanicus, N. coucang, and N. menagensis) at Cikananga Wildlife Rescue Centre (Sukabumi, Indonesia) under two different diet treatments: a captive diet high in fruits and a wild-type diet high in gum Nutrient Z P Higher in captive diet Ash −3.17 0.0020 Sugar −7.73 0.0001 Copper −6.77 0.0001 Higher in wild diet Crude protein −8.94 0.0001 Crude fat −9.38 0.0001 Energy density −4.59 0.0001 Soluble fiber −7.73 0.0001 Acid detergent Fiber −7.99 0.0001 Neutral Detergent fiber −7.48 0.0001 Calcium −9.62 0.0001 Phosphorus −8.39 0.0001 Magnesium −5.30 0.0001 Sodium −8.14 0.0001 No difference Iron −1.48 0.2780 908 Cabana F. et al. troglodytes) have anMRTof 37 and 37.0–48.0 h whereas the highly folivorous lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) has an MRT that may reach up to 97 h (Milton 1984; Milton and Demment 1988; Remis 2000; Remis and Dierenfeld 2004). The slow loris in this study had an MRT similar to that of P. pygmaeus, which is 80 times larger. There is a trend for frugivores to reduce their MRT when they ingest more fiber (Overdorff and Rasmussen 1995), while folivores (Remis and Dierenfeld 2004) and exudativores (Power and Oftedal 1996; this study) increase their MRT. The gouging marmosets (Cebuella and Callithrix) are often grouped with slow lorises owing to their exudativorous feeding ecologies (Smith 2010). Although data are limited, they also grouped together when MRT was plotted against body mass (Fig. 1). Slow lorises and marmosets are similar in their response to increased dietary fiber. Both groups of primates have unique traits and ecology, such as a low metabolic rate, the ability to ingest a diet high in plant secondary metabolites, and the ability to subsist on a diet of mostly plant exudates (Nekaris 2014). Marmosets and slow lorises have basal metabolic rates 72 and 60% of expected primate values (Genoud et al. 1997; Müller 1979). Their low-quality diet coupled with a slow metabolism probably culminates in the high MRT values observed for exudativorous primates. Slow lorises are well adapted to high-fiber diets. This may be important for their health (Campbell et al. 2001). Captive slow lorises suffer from many ailments including obesity, dental diseases, and kidney diseases (Cabana 2014; Cabana and Nekaris 2015; Debyser 1995; Fuller et al. 2013). Overall, captive diets are lacking or low in gum (and coincidentally in fiber compared to the wild) and are high in soluble carbohydrates (Cabana and Nekaris 2015). A longer MRT means an increased opportunity for fermentation, resulting in higher concentration of short-chain fatty acids Fig. 1 Published values for body mass and mean retention times for primates <20 kg with their ecological feeding niche: exudativores (orange diamond), granivores (gray triangle), folivores (blue circle), and frugivores (yellow X). Lines indicate lines of best fit where a steeper slope indicates a slower food passage rate per kg of body mass. Values and references are in ESM Table SI. Slow Lorises (Nycticebus spp.) Really are Slow: a Study into Food... 909 (Blaine and Lambert 2012; Lambert and Fellner 2012). A longer MRT also results in better digestive efficiencies for many nutrients. Moreover, the properties of volatile fatty acids created at the end of fermentation are associated with gut health benefits (Plaami 1997). These acids may contribute to positive gastrointestinal cell proliferation and increased substrate for cellular energy production, as well as a more stable luminal pH that allows bacterial metabolic functions to be most efficient (Walker and Buckley 2006). The acids can also have a protective effect against potential pathogens and diarrhoea, and reduce the negative effects of high soluble carbohydrates in the diet (Bailey and Coe 2002; Johnson et al. 1984). Increasing fiber in the diet may also increase satiation, possibly reducing stereotypies and other abnormal heath patterns (Britt et al. 2015; Remis and Dierenfeld 2004). There are no obvious downsides to increasing fiber in the diets of captive exudativorous primates and many possible benefits. In conclusion, slow lorises, like marmosets, increase their MRT values when dietary fiber increases. Their response to a higher fiber diet is similar to that of folivorous primates. Exudativorous primates seem to digest low-quality food slowly, presumably to allow fermentation, rather than quickly eating a larger amount of food with little to no opportunity for fermentation. Future studies should modify only fiber to derive more robust conclusions about the plasticity of exudativorous digestion, free from the possible effects of other nutrients.
