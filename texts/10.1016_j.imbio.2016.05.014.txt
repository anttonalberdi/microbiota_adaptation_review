However, the role of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the development of IBD is still largely unknown. Here, we used C6-deficient mice in which MAC formation was blocked due to the absence of C6 to develop an acute colitis model by the administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The results showed that DSS-induced colitis was aggravated in C6deficient mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, as represented by the markedly greater weight loss, higher disease activity index (DAI), shortened colon length, more severe histological injury with increased epithelial ulcerations, and massively increased infiltration of leukocytes accompanied by much higher myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in local inflammatory colonic sites. In addition, the DSS-induced colitis in C6-deficient mice could be significantly ameliorated by the exogenous C6 from WT sera. Furthermore, thenflammatory bowel disease significantly enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1, IL-6, CXCL-1, CCL-3, TGF-1 and IL-17F, was also observed in C6-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, the aggravated colitis in C6deficient mice may be not due to the increase of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in serum. Overall, we demonstrated that MAC exerts a protective role in acute colitis, strongly highlighting the host defense function of the complement system. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.. Introduction Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which encompasses ulcertive colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), is a chronic intestinal isorder characterized by relapsing and remitting inflammation ainly in colon and small intestine (Fiocchi, 2002). Numerous dysegulated inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the athogenesis of IBD, including abnormal intestinal microbial strucure (Sartor, 2015), host genetic defects (Knights et al., 2014), nappropriate activation of intestinal mucosal immune responses uch as pathogenic T cells and the complement system, and altered evels of various cytokines/chemokines, reactive oxygen species ∗ Corresponding author at: Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer enter, 270 Dong’an Road, Shanghai 200032, China.

The complement system is thought to be an important arsenal of innate immunity in host defense and a key mediator of inflammation (Morgan et al., 2005; Ricklin et al., 2010). Complement can be activated via three different pathways, leading to the generation of complement activation products, including C3b/iC3b, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9n) (Ricklin et al., 2010). Among them, C3b/iC3b opsonizes pathogens by phagocytosis; anaphylatoxins are potent enough to induce an inflammatory response, and MAC leads to the direct lysis of invading pathogens (Dunkelberger and Song, 2010). Complement dysfunction participates, to various extents, in the pathology of a range of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer’s disease and Crohn’s disease (Holers, 2014; Laufer et al., 2000). 1 iology a H i o c d a e v p e b m a w i e e I i C t t ( 2 2 L w a t t f f F w c C I 2 M d u f s 7 t w i o 4 W a 294 P. Ding et al. / Immunob In early studies, complement activation is shown to be associted with IBD patients (Laufer et al., 2000; Sugihara et al., 2010; alstensen et al., 1992; Ueki et al., 1996). Recently, more studes in rodent models of colitis have suggested a pathogenic role f complement. Deficiency in C3, the central component of the omplement cascade, has been reported to be protective against extran sulfate sodium (DSS)-included colitis in mice, suggesting pathogenic role of complement (Lu et al., 2010; Schepp-Berglind t al., 2012). However, mice deficient in C5 exhibited more aggraated colitis than WT mice after DSS treatment, indicating a rotective role of complement in experimental colitis (Deguchi t al., 2005). This aggravated injury in the C5-deficient mice could e due to the absence of either C5a or MAC. C5aR(CD88)-deficient ice have been reported to show milder disease symptoms in the cute model of DSS-induced colitis (Johswich et al., 2009), in line ith the protective effect of C5aR(CD88) antagonists in rat models nduced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) (Woodruff t al., 2003, 2005) and murine models of DSS-induced colitis (Jain t al., 2013). However, evidence of the role of MAC in experimental BD remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of MAC in acute DSS-induced coltis using C6-deficinent mice, in which the formations of the initial 5b-6 complex and further MAC are blocked due to the absence of he C6 component. We found that murine acute DSS-induced coliis was aggravated in C6-deficient mice compared with wild-type WT) mice, indicating the protective role of MAC in IBD. . Materials and methods .1. Mice Wild-type C57BL/6 background mice were obtained from SLAC aboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). C6-deficient mice ere kindly provided by Dr. Tod Merkel (Center for Biologics Evalution and Research, FDA, Bethesda, MD) and were backcrossed onto he same genetic background of C57BL/6 for more than 9 generaions. Age-matched eightto ten-week-old male mice were used or the experiments. Mice were housed under specific pathogenree conditions at the animal facility of Shanghai Medical School, udan University. Animal care and experiments were performed ith the consent of the Animal Ethics Committee at Shanghai Medial School, Fudan University, which complies with the Guide for the are and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National nstitutes of Health. .2. Induction of DSS colitis Experimental colitis was induced by oral administration of DSS, W 36–50 kDa (MP Biomedical, Inc., Solon, OH), at 3% (w/v) in rinking water ad libitum for 6 days. Control mice received reglar drinking water. During this period, mice were monitored daily or clinical signs and symptoms, including morbidity, body weight, tool consistency and the presence of blood in the stool. On day , all mice were sacrificed and blood samples were collected from he inferior vena cava after anesthetization. Additionally, the colon as dissected immediately to measure its length. To reconcile the effect of ectopic C6 on C6-deficient mouse coltis, 200 l sera of WT or C6-deficient mice were injected into WT r C6-deficent mice via tail vein on day 0 (before DSS challenge), 2, and 6, respectively. The other procedures remain unchanged. The T or C6-deficient mouse sera was pooled from a number of mice nd stored at −80 ◦C until use. 221 (2016) 1293–1303 2.3. Disease activity index (DAI) DAI was determined by combining scores of (1) body weight loss, (2) stool consistency, and (3) bleeding using a modified scale based on a previously described scoring system(Lu et al., 2010). In brief, each parameter was determined as follows: body weight loss relative to day 1 (0: <1%, 1: 1–5%, 2: 5–10%, 3: 10–15%, 4: >15%), stool consistency (0: normal, 2: loose, 4: diarrhea), and blood in stool (0: negative, 1: weak positive, 2: positive, 3: strong positive, 4: gross bleeding). Evaluation of DAIs was performed in a blinded fashion. 2.4. Histology and immunohistochemistry For histology, approximately 1–2-cm colon segments from control and DSS-treated mice were fixed overnight in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin block, cut into 5-m sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), as described previously (Lin et al., 2004). Histological scoring was graded by two investigators, blinded to the treatments and based on three parameters as described previously (Schepp-Berglind et al., 2012): (1) Infiltration of leukocytes (0, none; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, severe); (2) Depth of injury (0, none; 1, mucosal; 2, mucosal and submucosal; 3, transmural); and (3) Crypt damage (0, none; 1, basal one-third damaged; 2, basal two-thirds damaged; 3, only surface epithelium intact; 4, complete loss of crypt and epithelium). The maximum possible score was 10. For immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, colon sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase for 15 min at 37 ◦C and rinsed in PBS, followed by high-pressure antigen retrieval in citrate buffer. Then, the sections were incubated with mouse complement component C3d affinity purified polyclonal antibody (1:20; R&D Systems, Inc., MN) or rabbit anti-SC5b-9 neoantigen (1:200; Complement Technology, Inc., Tyler, TX) at 4 ◦C overnight. After 3 rinses in PBS, the tissue sections were incubated with HRP conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG H&L (1:200; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and peroxidase-conjugated affinipure goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (1:200; Proteintech Group, Inc.; Chicago, IL) at room temperature for 1 h. Then, immunoreactivity was performed using a GTVision III immunohistochemical detection kit (GK500705; Gene Tech, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.5. Real-time PCR Next, 100-mg colon samples from control and DSS-treated mice were stored in RNAlater Solution (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) and frozen immediately in −20 ◦C. Tissue was homogenized and total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Notably, bead-based oligo (dT) purification of mRNA was performed using the Invitrogen Dynabeads mRNA purification kit before cDNA synthesis (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI). Then, real-time PCR amplification was performed with a SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and normalized to mouse 18 s rRNA as the internal control. The related gene-specific primer sequences are shown in Supplemental Table 1. 2.6. Flow cytometry To remove erythrocytes from blood samples before leukocyte staining, blood samples were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (BioLegend, Inc., San Diego, CA) on ice. Cells were then incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs to mouse F4/80 (APC), CD11b (FITC), and Gr-1 (APC) (BioLegend, Inc., San Diego, CA) on ice for 30 min.

After clotting or 45 min at room temperature, serum was harvested by centrifuation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 ◦C, and analyzed immediately. hen, hemolytic assays were performed as described previously Qiao et al., 2014) to determine complement activation and MAC ormation. .10. Statistical analysis Data are presented as the mean ± SD or mean ± SEM, as indiated in the related figures. Significance was evaluated by Student’s -test (two-tailed) between two groups. Non-parametric analysis or clinical and histological scoring was performed using the Mannhitney U test. Values of p < 0.05 were regarded as statistically ignificant. All statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad rism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). . Results .1. Complement is activated in acute DSS-induced colitis Among the colitis animal models, DSS-induced colitis has been idely used to mimic IBD. Therefore, to investigate the role of MAC n the development of IBD, we first detected the complement actiation in DSS-induced colitis by comparing C6-deficient and WT ice. C3d is the end product of C3 cleavage deposited on cell memrane via its thioester bond. Thus, we detected the C3d deposition n colon tissue by IHC staining. We found that extensive and strong 3d staining in all colon sections in both DSS-treated C6-deficient 221 (2016) 1293–1303 and WT mice compared with negative C3d staining in mice without DSS treatment (Fig. 1a), indicating that massive complement activation results from DSS exposure in murine colitis. The pore-like MAC assembly in the target cells to induce cytolysis is one of physiological effectors of complement activation. Thus, we further used the IHC assay to detect MAC deposition in mouse colonic tissues with acute DSS treatment. We failed to observe MAC formation in DSS-treated C6-deficient mice by staining with SC5b-9. In DSS-treated WT mice, however, the presence of C6 led to the deposition of MAC, mainly in the colonic mucosa (Fig. 1b). As expected, there was no MAC formation in both groups of mice without DSS treatment (Fig. 1b). Finally, we measured the concentration of C5a, the split product of C5 after complement activation in colon tissue homogenates (CTH). As shown in Fig. 1c, C5a was almost undetectable in both C6-deficient and WT mice without DSS treatment, while its levels increased remarkably in both groups of mice receiving DSS treatment. Interestingly, we observed the significantly higher level of C5a in the CTH of C6-deficient mice, indicating stronger complement activation compared with WT mice with DSS treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrated that complement was extensively activated in DSS-induced colitis in both C6-deficient and WT mice by detecting C3d deposition and C5a production, except that there was no MAC formation in the colon of C6-deficient but not WT mice. 3.2. More severe clinical signs in C6-deficient mice Next, we studied the effect of the absence of MAC assembly in C6-deficient mice on DSS-induced colitis development. After receiving DSS treatment, C6-deficient mice displayed a significantly worse outcome in comparison to WT mice. In both groups of mice, clinical signs of colitis appeared from day 3 onward as determined by DAI, combining scores of weight loss, stool consistency and blood cells in the feces. However, in C6-deficient mice, DAI (starting from day 4, Fig. 2a), including body weight loss (starting from day 3, Fig. 2b), was significantly aggravated compared to the corresponding WT mice. In addition, DSS treatment induced higher mortality (14/22, approximately 63.6%) in C6-deficient mice relative to WT mice (2/21, approximately 9.5%) (Fig. 2c). These data suggested that C6 component and further MAC formation are required to prevent DSS-induced colitis. 3.3. Aggravated colon injury in C6-deficient mice To further reveal the subsequent colon injury that results from DSS exposure in both groups of mice, we first measured the colon length, which is a widely accepted objective indicator directly associated with pathological conditions during DSS colitis (Lu et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2013; Wende et al., 2013). We found that there was no significance in colon length between C6-deficient and WT mice without DSS treatment, whereas DSS treatment dramatically reduced the colon length in both groups of mice (Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, the deficiency of C6 further shortened the colon length when compared with the corresponding WT mice (Fig. 3a), indicating the potential protective role of MAC in DSS-induced colitis. Pathological H&E staining also supported the above findings. DSS exposure has been reported to cause colon injury with crypt loss, epithelial ulceration and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the bowel wall to varying degrees (Schepp-Berglind et al., 2012). Compared with WT mice, we observed the increased DSS-induced loss of crypts, epithelial ulceration and particularly colonic infiltration of profuse inflammatory cells in C6-deficient mice (Fig. 3b). Moreover, the histological score in C6-deficient mice only with but not without DSS treatment was significantly higher than that in WT mice (Fig. 3c). These observations further suggest the protective P. Ding et al. / Immunobiology Fig. 2. Clinical effects of DSS exposure in WT and C6-deficient mice.

Increased leukocyte infiltration in DSS-induced C6-deficient iceDSS-induced colitis is characterized by the massive infiltration f leukocytes, including macrophages and neutrophils, at least in art due to the chemoattractant activities of C3a/C5a produced in 221 (2016) 1293–1303 1297 complement activation (Schepp-Berglind et al., 2012). Using H&E staining, we observed that more leukocytes infiltrated the colonic submucosa of DSS-treated C6-deficient mice compared with the related WT mice (Fig. 3b), which is consistent with the higher C5a concentration in CTH of C6-deficient mice (Fig. 1c). To further classify the recruited leukocytes in the blood of C6-deficient and WT mice, we first employed flow cytometry to determine the proportions of macrophages (defined by CD11b+F4/80+ cells) and neutrophils (defined by CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells), the two major inflammatory immune cells. We found that DSS treatment significantly enhanced the recruitment of macrophages in the circulation of both groups of mice (Fig. 4a and b). Notably, there was a dramatic increase in the amount of macrophages in the blood of C6-deficient mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4a and b). Similar results were also observed in neutrophil detection (Fig. 4c and d). MPO is a heme protein that is most abundantly expressed in neutrophils to degrade invading pathogens. Therefore, we measured the MPO levels in CTH to evaluate the infiltration and activation of neutrophils in the local inflammatory colonic sites. We found that the MPO levels were dramatically increased in both groups of DSS-treated mice compared with the undetectable MPO levels in mice not receiving DSS treatment (Fig. 4e). Moreover, with acute DSS treatment, the C6-deficient mice displayed a much higher MPO level than WT mice (Fig. 4e), which is in agreement with the observation of greater leukocyte infiltration in the colonic submucosa (Fig. 3b) and more recruited macrophages and neutrophils in circulation (Fig. 4a–d) of DSS-treated C6-deficient mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that with acute DSS treatment, the local infiltration and circulatory recruitment of leukocytes were enhanced in C6-deficient mice compared with WT mice. 3.5. Enhanced production of chemokines and cytokines in C6-deficient mice To further investigate the inflammatory response during acute colitis, we analyzed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in transcriptional and/or translational levels in the CTH of DSS-treated mice. As shown in Fig. 5a, the transcriptions of all tested genes were found to be robustly upregulated after 6-day exposure to DSS when compared to control mice receiving normal drinking water. Further, we first observed that with acute DSS treatment, the mRNA levels of two important chemokines, neutrophil chemotaxin CXCL1 (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein CCL3 (MIP-1˛) were prominently upregulated in C6-deficient mice in comparison to WT mice (Fig. 5a). Secondly, the measurement of mRNA levels of two other important cytokines in the inflammatory process, IL1B (encoding IL-1) and IL-6, displayed a similar pattern (Fig. 5a). Thirdly, the transcription of TNFA (encoding TNF-), an important pro-inflammatory mediator implicated in IBD (Pache et al., 2009), was also slightly enhanced in DSS-treated C6-deficient mice compared with WT mice, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Fourth, considering previous reports that IL-1 acts as an inducer of the IL-17A response in the intestine and the Th17 response was implicated in IBD pathogenesis (Coccia et al., 2012), we assessed the transcription of IL-17A and IL-17F. However, we found that the increased mRNA level of IL–17 F but not IL-17A in C6-deficient mice reached statistical significance compared with WT mice (Fig. 5a). Finally, we detected the transcription of TGFB1 (encoding TGF-1), which was demonstrated to play an important role in IBD-related colorectal cancer (Terzic et al., 2010). Our results showed that the mRNA level of TGFB1 in C6-deficient mice was remarkably higher than that in the corresponding WT mice. To further confirm the real-time PCR results, we measured the protein levels of IL-1, IL-6, CCL3/MIP-1 and TNF- in CTH by 1298 P. Ding et al. / Immunobiology 221 (2016) 1293–1303 Fig. 3.

In good accordance with the above results on mRNA levls, the concentrations of IL-1, IL-6 and CCL3/MIP-1 were found o be considerably elevated in C6-deficient mice compared to WT ice after DSS treatment (Fig. 5b). In addition, the concentration f another critical pro-inflammatory mediator, the TNF- level in 6-deficient mice, appeared obviously higher than in WT mice; owever, there was no statistical significance (Fig. 5b). In concluion, the increased local levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hemokines, together with C5a in C6-deficient mice with acute SS treatment, may be highly associated with more severe coliis than WT mice, thus indicating a protective role for complement omponent C6 in DSS-induced colitis. .6. Deficiency of C6 did not induce LPS increase in serum Given the indispensable role of C6 in MAC assembly, we first erformed a complement-mediated hemolytic assay to functionlly verify the incapability of MAC formation in C6-deficient mice. he result showed that normal mouse serum (NMS) of WT mice ould induce massive hemolysis in contrast to the negligible hemolsis observed in C6-deficient NMS, whereas the heat-inactivated ouse serum (IMS) failed to induce hemolysis (Fig. 6a). Therefore, in the colon. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD; n = 5–10; **p < 0.01 and the failure of C6-deficient mouse NMS to induce hemolysis most likely attributes to the deficiency of C6. MAC formation in the targeted cell membrane is an important arm for complement to defend against invading pathogens. This fact leads us to assume that the stronger inflammatory response in DSS-treated C6-deficient mice than WT mice possibly resulted from the absence of MAC formation and thus more pathogens circulating in the blood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important membrane component of Gram-negative bacterial cells, which by itself can activate the classical and alternative complement pathways (Fine, 1974). Therefore, we measured the concentration of LPS in mouse serum using the ELISA method. Indeed, acute DSS treatment remarkably increased the LPS levels in serum; however, we failed to observe the significant increase of LPS levels in C6deficient mouse sera compared with WT mice. In contrast, the LPS level in sera decreased slightly in C6-deficient mice compared with WT mice, although it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 6b). Therefore, the underlying mechanisms of a stronger immune response, including higher levels of cytokine/chemokine production and more C5 cleavage in C6-deficient mice, require further investigation.

Exogenous C6 ameliorated DSS colitis in C6-deficient mice The inherited C6-deficient mice have been reported to display a oagulation defect due to decreased platelet aggregation (Bhole and tahl, 2004), and there is a tight interaction between complement nd coagulation (Qin et al., 2009; Amara et al., 2010). To exclude he possible other effects of C6-deficiency in DSS colitis, we restored 6 level by injecting WT mouse sera compared with C6 KO mouse era into C6-deficient mice or into accompanied WT mice. The comensated exogenous C6 from WT mouse sera could significantly ttenuate DAI (Fig. 7a), while the possibly-existed factors in C6 KO ouse sera did not alter the significance on DAI between WT and 6-deficient mice (Fig. 7b). Meanwhile, DAI in WT mice were not hanged regardless of the administration of WT or C6 KO mouse era (Fig. 7c). Furthermore, there was no statistical significance on AI between WT and C6-deficient mice both treated by WT sera8 per DSS-treated group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. CTH, colonic tissue homogenates. ND, (Fig. 7d). In addition, mortality (Fig. 7e), colon length (Fig. 7f), and macrophage counts in blood (Fig. 7g) all support that the compensated C6 from WT mouse sera could ameliorate the DSS-induced colitis in C6-deficient mice, and there were no possibly-existed factors in C6-deficient mouse sera that can influence the process of DSS-induced colitis. However, there was an exception for neutrophil counts in blood, in which administration of WT sera in C6-defecient mice reduced the neutrophil percentage without significance compared with administration of C6-deficient mouse sera (Fig. 7h). This result indicates that the exogenous C6 amount may be not enough to compensate the endogenous C6 level. In addition, the presence of C6 and the consequent MAC formation in C6-deficient mice treated by the exogenous C6 from WT sera were demonstrated by the results of IHC assay. We observed extensive MAC staining in C6-deficient mice treated by WT sera, which was similar with those in WT mice (Fig. 7i). P. Ding et al. / Immunobiology 221 (2016) 1293–1303 1301 Fig. 6.

Discussion It has been well documented that the etiology of IBD is mulifactorial (Naito et al., 2003). So far, much effort has been made nd many contributing factors have been elaborated, resulting in herapeutic approaches, including the application of anti-TNF- ntibodies, such as infliximab (Sandborn and Loftus, 2004). Howver, given that the limited effectiveness and side effects of the onventional treatment of IBD, the underlying mechanisms of the athogenesis of IBD need to be further investigated to identify addiional effective targets (Yamamoto-Furusho, 2007). The involvement of complement activation in IBD patients as also been demonstrated since the 1970s, as indicated by he local deposition and/or circulatory alteration of complement ctivation by-products (Jain et al., 2014). However, the role of omplement activation remains unclear. Complement activation as been demonstrated to be protective or pathogenic in acute SS-induced murine colitis, depending on its activation pathway; he classical and lectin pathways provide important protection in erms of host defense, whereas the alternative pathway appears to rive intestinal inflammation and tissue injury (Schepp-Berglind t al., 2012). In addition, the roles of different complement comonents in experimental colitis models are also controversial. C3r complement factor B (CFB)-deficient mice has shown amelioated intestinal inflammation in acute DSS colitis (Schepp-Berglind t al., 2012). Moreover, mice deficiency in C5 appeared to aggravate SS-induced acute colitis (Deguchi et al., 2005). In contrast, anti-C5 ntibody treatment ameliorated DSS-induced murine acute coliis (Aomatsu et al., 2013). Similarly, the irreversible antagonists of 5aR(CD88), PMX53 and/or PMX205, could protect TNBS-induced ats or DSS-induced mice from intestinal inflammation (Woodruff t al., 2003, 2005; Jain et al., 2013). Furthermore, the deficiency of 5aR(CD88) could ameliorate acute DSS-induced colitis (Johswich t al., 2009). It should be noted that C5 deficiency can hinder C5a roduction and MAC formation. Therefore, to further clarify the role f C5 in colitis requires an understanding of the separate roles of 5a and MAC. C6 is an indispensable ingredient for MAC formation in omplement defense against invading pathogens. In this study, 6-deficient mice were employed to reveal the role of MAC in he etiology of murine colitis with acute DSS treatment. We ound that C6 deficiency induced more body weight loss, higher AI, and higher mortality accompanied by higher histological cores, more immune cell infiltration and more local C5a and ytokine/chemokine production, thus leading to more severe colitis ompared with C6 sufficiency. The crosswise injection of WT or C6-ase the LPS levels in mouse sera after DSS treatment compared with C6 sufficiency. d group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. ns, no significance; NMS, normal mouse serum; IMS, deficient mouse sera into WT or C6-deficient mice demonstrated that the exogenous C6 from WT mouse sera could remarkably ameliorate the DSS-induced colitis in C6-deficient mice. Therefore, these findings suggest that C6 and MAC play a protective role, whereas C5a-C5aR (CD88) signaling mediates the pathogenic functions in DSS-induced murine colitis. Although MAC formation is an important approach for complement to defend against invading pathogens, it has been demonstrated in C6-deficient subjects that MAC is important in protecting the host from invasive Neisseria meningococcal infections (Zhu et al., 2000; Orren et al., 2012; Moya-Quiles et al., 2013). Therefore, it is possible that we failed to observe increased serum LPS levels in C6-deficient mice with acute DSS treatment. In addition, our further finding that the anaphylatoxin C5a was increased in DSS-treated C6-deficient mice compared with WT mice is in agreement with a previous report (Brauer et al., 1993), in which C6-deficient rats generated more C5a with discordant cardiac xenografts. However, the underlying mechanisms of increased C5 cleavage require further study. In sum, we present evidence for a protective role of MAC in the pathogenesis of acute DSS-induced colitis, highlighting the host defense function of the terminal complement complex. Based on previous studies, complement has been widely regarded to be active in the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes, including IBD. Consequently, the targeted inhibition of complement has been suggested to possess potential therapeutic applications (Ricklin and Lambris, 2007). Considering the opposite role of C5a-C5aR(CD88) and MAC in intestinal inflammation, it should be carefully taken into account that the pharmacological inhibition of complement may produce double-edge effects.
