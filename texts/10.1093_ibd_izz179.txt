Original research article—Basic science Identification of Key Pro-Survival Proteins in Isolated Colonic Goblet Cells of Winnie, a Murine Model of Spontaneous Colitis Richard Wilson, PhD,*,¥ Rohit Gundamaraju,†,¥ Ravichandra Vemuri,† Constanza Angelucci, PhD,† Dominic Geraghty, PhD,† Nuri Gueven, PhD,‡ and Rajaraman D. Eri, PhD† Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that the goblet cell-derived mucin-2 (Muc2) is a major component of the immune system and that perturbations in Muc2 lead to an ulcerative colitis–like phenotype. The animal model Winnie carries a missense mutation in Muc2 that causes Muc2 misfolding, accumulation in goblet cells, and ER stress. Excessive ER stress is a hallmark of many diseases, including ulcerative colitis, cancer, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. However, rather than committing to cell death, which is the typical outcome of unresolved ER stress, Winnie goblet cells are characterized by hyperproliferation, suggesting additional regulation of this cellular stress response. Methods: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis in the Winnie model, we isolated goblet cells from Winnie and wild-type mice and used label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics to understand the functional consequences of Muc2 misfolding and accumulation. Results: A large number of changes were identified that highlight a dramatic reprogramming of energy production, including enhanced utilization of butyrate, a key energy source of colonic cells. A major finding was the marked upregulation of the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain proteins Chchd2, Chchd3, and Chchd6. In particular, we identified and confirmed the upregulation and nuclear translocation of Chchd2, a protein known to inhibit oxidative stress induced apoptosis. Conclusions: This study is the first to apply proteome-level analysis to the preclinical Winnie model of ulcerative colitis. Identification of proteins and pathways affected in isolated Winnie goblet cells provides evidence for novel adaptive mechanisms underlying cell survival under conditions of chronic ER stress. Key Words: ER stress, ulcerative colitis, quantitative proteomics, apoptosis, proliferation INTRODUCTION Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized primarily by severe inflammation of the colon and has been identified as a major risk factor for colorectal cancer.1 Although the underlying etiology is poorly understood, the molecular pathology of UC includes disruption of mucosal glands and distortion of crypts2 with consequences ranging from edema to ulceration and even haemorrhages. In addition, UC patients show higher levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in their colonic epithelia.3 Secretory cells, especially goblet cells (GCs), create the mucus surfaces in the intestine. The importance of mucin and ER stress in UC was demonstrated in the Winnie mouse model, where increased ER stress in GCs or mucin deletion leads to spontaneous colitis.3, 4 The Winnie mouse exhibits extensive ER stress within the intestinal GCs due to accumulation of Muc2, leading to both innate and adaptive immune responses, elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17, and culminating in severe intestinal inflammation.3 Similarities of the Winnie mouse model to human UC include histopathology, where severe ulcerations and superficial inflammation are restricted to the distal colon region (unlike the granulomatous small intestinal lesions seen in Crohn’s disease), the goblet cell–specific pathology (ie, reduced mucin secretion and thinner mucous layer), and a cytokine profile dominated by Il-1β and IL-17. Endoplasmic reticulum stress is typically characterized by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an evolutionarily conserved compensatory mechanism orchestrated through ER transmembrane receptors to which the chaperone BiP is normally bound (see Han and Kaufman5 and Grootjans et al6 for recent reviews). Excessive demand for secretory proteins or accumulation of misfolded proteins releases BiP, triggering UPR signaling cascades that restore proteostasis through translational attenuation, destruction of misfolded doi: 10.1093/ibd/izz179 Published online 24 August 2019 D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ibdjournal/article/26/1/80/5554378 by guest on 21 January 2022 Inflamm Bowel Dis • Volume 26, Number 1, January 2020 81 Comparative Proteomics of Winnie and Wild-type Mice proteins, and increased protein-folding capacity within the ER. When unresolved, chronic ER stress often but not always results in cell death via C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP)–mediated apoptosis. Proteomics has been used to investigate ER stress in cell cultures challenged with pharmacological agents in patient cell lines7, 8 and mouse models of human pathologies, including autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease,9 experimental diabetes,10 skeletal dysplasias,11 and Alzheimer’s disease.12 Collectively, these studies have highlighted that although some common pathways and cellular systems are affected by ER stress, other mechanisms and ultimately cell fate are often context-dependent due to the specialized nature of many cell types. In the colon tissue of Winnie mice, we previously observed significant elongation of the crypts of the distal large intestine in addition to inflammation.3 Staining with bromodeoxyuridine / 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) showed this was most likely due to the hyperproliferation of GCs, suggesting that the ER stress phenotype in Winnie is attenuated by pro-survival signaling mechanisms. A key question, therefore, remains as to how GCs experiencing chronic ER stress not only survive but also are able to proliferate. The goal of the present study was to characterize the ER stress response in the Winnie model to gain a better understanding of the molecular pathology and in particular identify candidate prosurvival proteins. To achieve this, cell lysates were prepared from GCs isolated from the colon tissue of age-matched Winnie and wild-type mice and analyzed using label-free quantitative proteomics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Design Proteomics analysis was performed directly and specifically on GCs harvested from mutant and wild-type mice as described later on. Due to limited sample availability and the need to balance the number of animals sacrificed for this study with the ability to perform a broad and semiquantitative assessment of alterations to the cellular proteome, n = 3 was considered appropriate. Isolation of GCs The animals were sacrificed via CO2 asphyxiation in the morning before the abdomen was dissected and the colon removed. Colons were then harvested from 20 Winnie (homozygous Muc2 mutant) and 20 wild-type mice (C57BL6/J background) of both sexes (all aged 16 weeks), sliced lengthwise, and washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Colons were kept on ice in DMEM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (1000 U/mL), and streptomycin (1000 ug/L) (Gibco BRL) until all tissues were collected. The colons were washed twice with PBS and placed in pre-digestion solution (liberase 0.35mL; Hank’s Buffered Saline Solution [HBSS]). Samples were incubated  with 5  mg/mL liberase in HBSS for 15 minutes with rocking in a 37°C incubator set to 4.5% CO2. Colon crypts were collected by scraping the colon cells from the basement membrane using a  pipette tip and forceps. The isolated crypts were then passed through a 100-µm cell sieve. The cells were then subjected to a gentle spin at 3000 xg, 4°C for 5 minutes and isolated according to the gradient assay used in previous studies on GCs.13 The goblet cell pellet was resuspended in freezing medium (6:3:1, medium:FCS:DMEM) and was transferred into a cryovial and stored for future use. Peptide Sample Preparation and Analysis by Nano-Liquid Chromatography and LTQ-Orbitrap Tandem Mass Spectrometry Protein samples were reduced, alkylated, and digested with proteomics-grade trypsin (Sigma) using established methods.14 Tryptic peptides equivalent to ~1 µg of digested protein were analyzed using an LTQ-Orbitrap interfaced with an Ultimate 3000 nano RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, peptides were loaded onto a 20 mm x 75 µm PepMap 100 trapping column (3 µm C18) at 5 µL/minute, using 98% water, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were separated at 300 nL/minute on a 250 mm x 75 µm PepMap 100 RSLC column (2 µm C18) held at 40°C, using a stepped gradient from 98% mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 50% mobile phase B (0.08% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile and 20% water), comprising 3%–10% B over 10 minutes, 10%–40% B over 180 minutes, 40%–50% B over 10 minutes, holding at 95% B for 10 minutes, then re-equilibration in 2% B for 15 minutes. The LTQ-Orbitrap was controlled using Xcalibur 2.1 software in data-dependent mode, and MS/MS spectra were acquired using a Top8 method and 30-second dynamic exclusion of fragmented peptides, as described.14 Database Searching and Criteria for Protein Identification Data files were imported into MaxQuant version 1.5.1.2 (maxquant.org), and MS/MS spectra were searched using the Andromeda search engine against the complete Mus musculus reference proteome (ID 000000589; updated on October 2, 2014) comprising 44,455 protein entries. Default settings for protein identification by LTQ-Orbitrap MS/MS and label-free quantitation (LFQ) included a maximum of 2 missed cleavages, mass error tolerances of 20 ppm, then 4.5 ppm for initial and main peptide searches, respectively, 0.5 Da tolerance for fragment ions, variable methionine oxidation, and fixed carbamidomethylation. A  false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 was used for peptide-spectrum matches and protein identification. The full set of identified peptides and proteins (MaxQuant output files peptides.txt and proteinGroups.txt, respectively) are combined in Supplemental Table 1.

Protein groups identified as potential contaminants (prefixed with CON) and proteins only identified by site or by reverse database matching were removed, and LFQ intensity values were log2–transformed. The proteins were filtered to include only those detected in all 3 replicates of at least 1 genotype. Missing values were replaced with random intensity values for low-abundance proteins based on a normal distribution of protein abundances using default Perseus parameters. To determine proteins that were significantly altered in abundance between genotypes, we applied a 1-sided t test using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing with an FDR set to 0.01. Data were exported from Perseus into Excel after each dataprocessing step and are included in Supplemental Table 2 as filtered protein expression (LFQ) data (sheet 1), results of missing value imputation (sheet 2), result of statistical analysis (sheet 3), calculated fold-changes (sheet 4), z-scored data, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) identifiers for significant proteins (sheet 5). Bioinformatics Analysis To extract functional information from the proteomics data, the groups of proteins that were significantly up regulated or downregulated in Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs were imported into the online bioinformatics resource DAVID (version 6.8) using the mouse genome as background.16 Functional annotation clusters (FACs) were generated using default parameters and filtered based on P values <0.05 after adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. The complete DAVID output is reported in Supplemental Table 3 as FACs for significant upregulated (sheet 1) and downregulated proteins (sheet 2) and the full protein lists for functional terms representative of significant FACs for upregulated (sheet 3) and downregulated proteins (sheet 4). To identify significantly regulated pathways, proteins that were either upregulated or downregulated in Winnie GCs were converted from UniProt IDs into KEGG gene names, then mapped to KEGG pathways using “search pathway.” Ethical Considerations All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Tasmania (Approval number: A14095) and conducted in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (8th Edition 2013). Mice were purchased from UTAS farm facility (Hobart, Australia) and housed at 21°C with a 12-hour day/night cycle. All mice had ad libitum access to radiation-sterilized rodent feed (Barastoc Rat and Mouse, Ridley Ag Products, Australia) and autoclaved tap water. RESULTS Proteomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Protein Exclusively From GCs Isolated From Winnie and Wild-type Colons To profile changes in the proteome of goblet cells isolated from Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs, cell lysates were prepared by sonication in a urea/thiourea lysis buffer, and protein extracts were cleaned up by ethanol precipitation. Proteins were digested and tryptic peptides separated and analyzed by nano HPLC/MS. The MS/MS data were processed as described previously (section 2.5). At a 1% FDR, MS/MS spectra matched to 10,217 unique peptide sequences, which were assigned to a total of 1470 protein groups (Supplemental Table 1). After exclusion of proteins identified on the basis of single matching peptides, a filtered list of 956 proteins that included only proteins detected in all 3 replicates of at least 1 genotype was used to identify proteins that were significantly modulated between wild-type and Winnie GCs. A t test analysis of the LFQ expression values identified 426 proteins as differentially abundant between Winnie and wild-type GCs, based on a 1% FDR using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Of the significant proteins, 251 were upregulated and 175 were downregulated in Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs. The P values, log2 fold-differences (t test differences), and protein LFQ ratios (Winnie/wild-type) for the significant proteins are provided in Supplemental Table 2 (sheet 4, Columns P, Q, and U, respectively). Differentially Modulated Proteins in Winnie Revealed by Bioinformatics Approach The functional categories shown correspond to the grouped functional terms highlighted in Tables 1 and 2. The web-based integrated functional annotation software DAVID16 was used to identify GO terms, protein families, and biological pathways that were significantly enriched. DAVID output files for the subsets of significantly upregulated and downregulated proteins showing the FACs of ontological terms, and proteins included in each term are presented in Supplemental Table 3. In total, 39 and 20 FACs comprising 198 and 104 significant functional terms (BenjaminiHochberg adjusted P values <0.05) were associated with the upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively. Tables 1 and 2 summarize this information, in which the FACs are represented by those ontological terms/pathways with the highest D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ibdjournal/article/26/1/80/5554378 by guest on 21 January 2022 Inflamm Bowel Dis • Volume 26, Number 1, January 2020 83 Comparative Proteomics of Winnie and Wild-type Mice protein counts. These terms were further grouped according to related functional categories that are highlighted on the tables in different shading colours. The upregulated proteins (Table 1) are broadly related to mitochondrial function (grey shading; n = 201 proteins), carbon metabolism (tan shading; n  =  43 proteins), unfolded protein binding (blue shading; TABLE 1.

In total, 219 of the 251 upregulated proteins (87%) were captured within this small number of functional categories. The downregulated proteins (Table 2) were classified into groups related to transcription/translation (grey shading; n = 118 proteins), cell structure (tan shading; n = 33 proteins), and protein trafficking (red shading; n = 16 proteins). Again, a high proportion of the 175 downregulated proteins (78%) were captured by these 3 functional categories. Venn diagrams were then used to illustrate the degree of overlap between these groups of functionally related ontological terms (Fig. 1). As 201 of the 251 upregulated proteins were related to mitochondrial function, it was not surprising that few proteins were related specifically to the other functional categories, with the exception of the annexins (which were omitted from the Venn diagram due to the display limit of 5 subsets). Similarly, of the 175 downregulated proteins within the major group of 118 proteins related to transcription and translation, 17 of those proteins also related to cell structure, and 5 proteins related to protein transport. This illustrates that a high proportion (84%) of the proteins modulated in Winnie cells could be described by a small number of global cellular functions, which are discussed in further detail below. Major Upregulated Metabolic Pathways and Cellular Processes Altered as a Consequence of ER Stress in Winnie GCs The misfolding and accumulation of Muc2 in Winnie GCs affected 21 proteins associated directly with unfolded protein binding and stabilization, a central role of the UPR. These proteins are listed alongside a heat map of their respective LFQ expression data in Figure 2A and include chaperones involved in protein biosynthesis and quality control in numerous cellular compartments. Among them were ER chaperones with well-known roles in the UPR such as BiP (Grp78/Hspa5), its binding partner, hypoxia-upregulated protein-1 (Hyou1/Grp170), calreticulin (Calr), the collagen-specific chaperone Hsp47 (Serpinh1), and 2 protein disulphide isomerases (P4hb/Pdia1 and Erp72/Pdia4). This subgroup also included the mitochondrial chaperones Hsp75 (Trap1), stress-70 protein (Hspa9/Grp75), Tid1 (Dnaja3), the Hsp60/Hsp10 (Hspd1/Hspe1) chaperonin complex, and 2 chaperone-like proteins that stabilize nascent polypeptides during D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ibdjournal/article/26/1/80/5554378 by guest on 21 January 2022 Inflamm Bowel Dis • Volume 26, Number 1, January 2020 85 Comparative Proteomics of Winnie and Wild-type Mice FIGURE 1. Venn diagrams summarizing the major groupings of significant GO terms affected in the GCs of Winnie mice, where the values indicated correspond to the number of (A) upregulated and (B) downregulated proteins. translocation into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Timm10 and Timm13). Finally, the cytosolic Hsp90 chaperone complex (Hsp90aa1 and Hsp90ab1) was also upregulated as part of the overall cellular mechanism for handling nascent polypeptides and/or misfolded proteins in multiple cellular compartments. Based on evidence from previous studies, in particular proteomeand genome-wide investigation of the effects of protein misfolding on cellular function, there is a strong connection between ER stress and perturbation of energy-related metabolic pathways.9, 11, 17, 18 Of the 251 upregulated proteins, a remarkable 80% were related to mitochondrial protein activity and, in particular, ATP generation. The 34 proteins that mapped to the KEGG pathway mmu00190 (Oxidative phosphorylation) included components of all 5 transmembrane complexes belonging to the electron transport chain and ATP synthase proton pump. These proteins are shown schematically in Supplemental Figure 1, and their corresponding LFQ expression data are displayed in Figure 2B. They comprised 21 complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) subunits, 2 complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) subunits, 3 complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) subunits, 3 complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) subunits, and 4 complex V (ATP synthase) subunits. In addition, the increase in mitochondrial respiratory enzymes was accompanied by increased levels of proteins required for generating cofactors essential for oxidative phosphorylation. This included the ubiquinone biosynthesis proteins (Coq3, Coq5, Coq6, Coq7, and Adck3/Coq8a) and enzymes involved in NADH production via fatty acid beta-oxidation. Accordingly, 13 proteins that mapped to the KEGG pathway mmu00190 (Fatty acid degradation) were detected at increased levels in Winnie samples (Supplemental Fig. 2). These proteins, shown in Figure 2C, included both alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme complex (Hadha and Hadhb) and acetyl coenzyme A dehydrogenases (ACADs) that act on short/branched, long, and very long chain fatty acids (Acadsb, Acadl, and Acadvl). The electron transport flavoprotein alpha and beta subunits (Etfa and Etfb), which maintain ACAD activity by acting as electron acceptors, were also upregulated. In addition to NADH, another important product of fatty acid beta-oxidation is acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid (TCA) cycle, a further key mechanism for energy production within the mitochondrial matrix. The 38 proteins increased in Winnie cell extracts related to carbon metabolism included 19 proteins that provided near-complete coverage of the TCA pathway (Supplemental Fig. 3 and Fig. 2D). Demand for acetyl-CoA was also evident from raised levels of 3 acetyl co-A synthetases (Acsf2, Acfm3, and Acss1), included within the significant GO term “Lipid metabolic processes.” Further modulation of bioenergetic pathways in Winnie GCs was evident from the 16 upregulated components of the KEGG pathways mmu00010 (Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis) and mmu00620 (Pyruvate metabolism), demonstrating increased utilization of this strategy for rapid ATP generation (Fig. 2E). Glycolysis-related proteins elevated in Winnie cell extracts included one of the key regulatory enzymes, pyruvate kinase (Pkm), which catalyzes the irreversible conversion of phosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate (Supplemental D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ibdjournal/article/26/1/80/5554378 by guest on 21 January 2022 Inflamm Bowel Dis • Volume 26, Number 1, January 2020 86 Wilson et al D ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ibdjournal/article/26/1/80/5554378 by guest on 21 January 2022 Inflamm Bowel Dis • Volume 26, Number 1, January 2020 87 Comparative Proteomics of Winnie and Wild-type Mice Figs. 4 and 5). While one fate of pyruvate is conversion to lactate, we found no evidence for altered lactate dehydrogenase levels. Rather, increased abundance of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits (Pdha1,  Pdhb, Pdhx, and Dlat) and acetyl co-A synthetase (Acss1) indicated utilization of the pyruvate decarboxylation pathway, which both regenerates NADH and increases flux of the anapleurotic intermediate acetyl co-A into the TCA cycle. Together, these results demonstrate the extent of metabolic reprogramming required to meet the energy demands of GCs affected by ER stress. However, the observed increase in levels of proteins involved in butanoate (butyrate) metabolism provides evidence for another, more cellspecific prosurvival adaptation of energy homeostasis. These 8 proteins are depicted in Supplemental Figure 6, showing the KEGG pathway mmu00650 (Butanoate metabolism). Butyrate is a fermentation product of dietary fiber that not only is an important energy source in colonocytes but also exhibits strong anti-inflammatory effects and is essential for colonocyte survival.19 The consequence of increased oxidative phosphorylation is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and upregulation of antioxidant systems is a prominent feature of ER stress.20 Redox homeostasis is maintained by multiple antioxidant enzymes within the mitochondrial matrix. Accordingly, 9 proteins associated with oxidative stress were among the mitochondrial proteins upregulated in Winnie GCs (Fig. 2). The significant functional terms “redox-active center” and “peroxisome” (Fig. 2F) included the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase that destroys free radicals (Sod2), catalase (Cat), and the peroxiredoxins Prdx1, Prdx3, and Prdx5, which remove the hydrogen peroxide generated by this reaction. Of these antioxidant enzymes, Prdx3 has been shown to scavenge 90% of peroxides in the mitochondrial matrix.21 Several additional mitochondrial proteins involved in ROS detoxification were also increased, including glutathione reductase (Gsr), which is important for glutathione homeostasis, and glutaredoxin-5 (Glrx5), which has been shown to be protective against ROSmediated apoptosis.22 Lastly, 3 proteins belonging to the coiledcoil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain (CHCHD) family were upregulated in the GCs of Winnie mice (Chchd2, Chchd3, and Chchd6). Although the involvement of CHCHD proteins in oxidative stress is only beginning to emerge, their twin CX3C or CX9C motifs have been proposed to facilitate ROS scavenging. 23 The final catabolic pathway identified as significantly altered in Winnie cells involves the breakdown of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), as indicated on the KEGG pathway mmu00280 (Valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation), which included 25 significantly upregulated proteins (Supplemental Fig. 7 and heat map Fig. 2G). Branched chain amino acid catabolism is a major pathway utilized by adipocytes, where BCAA uptake and metabolism within the mitochondria provides the substrates acetyland succinyl-CoA for lipogenesis.24 Although little is known about the role of BCAA catabolism in the context of ER stress, suppression of BCAA catabolic enzymes has recently been associated with impaired heart function in both humans and rodents, where accumulation of BCAA catabolic intermediates affects cardiac mitochondrial activity and redox homeostasis.25 Recently, high concentrations of BCAAs have been shown to cause oxidative stress via the mTOR pathway,26, 27 suggesting that BCAA breakdown may also be part of the cellular defense against oxidative stress. Major Downregulated Metabolic Pathways and Cellular Processes Altered as a Consequence of ER Stress in Winnie GCs A hallmark of the ER stress response is attenuation of nascent protein biosynthesis to reduce the load on ER quality control machinery and restore proteostasis. As a clear indication of translational repression in the GCs from Winnie mice, 26 of the 45 proteins associated with the functional term “ribonucleoprotein” (Fig. 3A) were ribosomal subunits (Supplemental Fig. 8). Previous analysis of Winnie goblet cell ultrastructure revealed a paucity of ribosomal structures at the surface of a highly vacuolized rough ER.3 Proteins involved in translation and transcription regulation also belong to this subgroup, including RNA helicases (Ddx1, Ddx5, and Dhx9) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, a multifunctional family of proteins involved in mRNA packing and stability, pre-mRNA processing, mRNA export from the nucleus, and translation initiation (recently reviewed by Geuens et al28). Significant downregulation of these proteins, in some cases by more than 4-fold (Hnrnpa0, Hnrnpl, and Hnrnpu) is consistent with the reduced demand for mRNA processing during ER stress. Indeed, 22 proteins associated with the intronprocessing spliceosome machinery captured by the KEGG pathway mmu03040 (Supplemental Fig. 9) and GO_CC term “spliceosome complex” were significantly downregulated. These included common components of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), such as Snrpd2 and Snrpd3, and particle-specific components, such as the U2 snRNP splicing factors Sf3b2 and Sf3b3. Collectively, this group of 118 proteins represent multiple steps of the transcriptional and translational FIGURE 2.

The second major group of downregulated proteins was related to cell structure and intercellular interactions (summarized in Fig. 3B). Although cytoskeletal remodelling is a very plausible consequence of ER stress (eg, to enhance ER-plasma membrane [PM] communication and restore Ca2+ homeostasis29), very little is known about the effects of ER stress on specific cytoskeletal proteins. Among the subgroup of 14 proteins classified as actinbinding were proteins involved in actin organization at cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions—such as actinin-1 (Actn1), cingulin (Cgn), LIM domain and actin-binding protein 1 (Lima), and the nonerythrocyte spectrin beta chain (Sptbn1)—data that support previously observed loss of tight junction integrity in Winnie cells in vivo.3 Furthermore, our results provided evidence for altered cadherin-catenin adhesion complex signaling as a further outcome of ER stress in Winnie GCs, with downregulation of epithelial cadherin (E-cad/Cdh1), together with α-catenin, β-catenin, and γ-catenin/junction plakoglobin (Ctnna1, Ctnnb1, and Jup) that couple E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, this protein group included actin-binding proteins with intracellular functions such as the trafficking of organelles along actin filaments (Myo1a, Myo1c, and Myo1d) and vesicular transport (Clint1 and Golga2), consistent with the observed reduction in coatomer subunits (Copa, Copb1, Cope, Copg1, and Copz1) required for protein trafficking through the secretory pathway. Validation of Key Protein Candidates in Winnie GCs Our proteomics analysis revealed sweeping alterations in the goblet cellular proteome in the Winnie mouse, with profound effects across multiple organellar systems, including the mitochondria and ER. To further investigate candidates that might promote the survival of GCs despite their chronic state of ER stress, we focused on the mitochondrial protein Chchd2, a recently described inhibitor of apoptosis.30 The results of our proteomics analysis were consistent with elevated ROS production as a consequence of ER and mitochondrial stress in Winnie cells. Because Chchd2 is capable of ROS-dependent translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus and transactivation of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration,31 we used immunofluorescence to establish the intracellular localization of Chchd2. This approach not only confirmed the elevated expression of Chchd2 but also showed a striking overlap in fluorescent signal for Chchd2 with both the mito-tracker and DAPI stains, signifying the presence of Chchd2 in both organelles (Fig. 4). These results, therefore, indicate that in addition to acting as a potential negative regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis, elevated levels of Chchd2 may be part of a feedback mechanism that further stimulates oxidative phosphorylation and survival of Winnie GCs. The proteomics data also revealed that misfolding of Muc2 was associated with increased levels of several ER chaperones FIGURE 4. Validation of Chchd2 upregulation in Winnie colon tissue.

Accumulation of Muc2 was also evident from the proteomics data, with a 1.9-fold increase in Winnie compared with wild-type GCs (Supplemental Table 2). As a major secretory product of GCs, we hypothesized that accumulation of misfolded Muc2 could lead to coretention with other macromolecules in the ER, as previously observed in chondrocytes expressing disease-causing mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein.32 Levels of the basement membrane protein nidogen-1 were increased ~5-fold in Winnie GCs. Therefore, we used immunofluorescence to detect nidogen-1 in the colon tissue of Winnie and wild-type mice (Fig. 5), confirming the increased abundance of nidogen-1 identified using proteomics. DISCUSSION This study applied proteomics to investigate the molecular pathology of a spontaneous mouse model of ulcerative colitis, in which ER stress is a prominent feature. Over the last decade, it has become clear that ER stress plays a key role in a growing number of human pathologies and is emerging as a promising druggable target (eg, in specific types of colorectal cancer33 and Ewing’s sarcoma).34 In the Winnie mouse, the primary defect leading to ER stress is misfolding and accumulation of Muc2, the major secretory product of GCs in the colonic crypts. The downstream consequences of ER stress and ultimate cell fate often depend upon both the underlying cause and cell type, highlighting the need for empirical data on the specific cellular response. Although the etiology of UC is largely unknown, the prevalence of ER stress and inflammation in the colon tissue of Winnie mice provides an opportunity for detailed ex vivo analysis of a pathologically relevant ER stress model directly in the specific cell type affected. Bioinformatics analysis of the proteomics data clustered ~80% of the modulated proteins into a relatively small number of related functional (GO) terms and KEGG pathways (Fig. 1 and Tables 1 and 2). Consequently, our dataset is notable for high coverage of significant upregulated and downregulated pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (34 of 134 proteins), fatty acid degradation (25 of 49 proteins), valine leucine and isoleucine degradation (32 of 56 proteins), TCA cycle (19 of 32 proteins), ribosome (42 of 177 proteins), and spliceosome (22 of 133 proteins). The high proportion overall of significantly affected proteins (adjusted P value <0.01) is comparable with other published in vivo models of ER stress. For example, in hyperglycaemic pancreatic β-cells, chronic ER stress also results in significant modulation of ~45% of the detected proteins10 and has similar effects on energy metabolism, including enhanced mitochondrial respiration via oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle, excess free radical production, and hallmarks of oxidative stress. Although Dornadula et  al10 and others11 identified increased levels of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and proteasomal subunits in ER stress, we found no evidence for increased ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In contrast, proteasomal subunits detected in our analysis (Psmc3, Psmc4, Psmc5, Psmd1, and Psmd2) were all downregulated in Winnie GCs. It is possible, therefore, that Muc2 hyperoligomerization and formation of large proteoglycan aggregates prevent retrotranslocation into the cytosol and proteasomal degradation. Our data also suggest that the vacuolized ER observed in the Winnie mucosal cells is likely to contain not only Muc2 aggregates but also other secretory products such as nidogen-1. Tissue microenvironment may be a key determinant of cell fate under conditions of chronic ER stress. For example in growth plate cartilage, chondrocytes avoid ER stress–induced apoptosis by specific upregulation of glycolysis, the preferred pathway for energy production under hypoxic conditions, reducing their dependence on oxidative phosphorylation and excessive generation of ROS.11 In contrast, colonic mucosal cells derive a high proportion of their energy from FIGURE 5.

Interestingly, sodium butyrate (NaB) and related histone deacetylase inhibitors such as 4-hydroxybutyrate are emerging as potential pharmacological mediators of ER stress (Khan et al35). Indeed, NaB was recently shown to effectively attenuate ER stress–induced apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus by inhibition of the PERK-CHOP pathway.36 Conversely, butyrate exhibits antitumorigenic properties in colorectal cancer cell lines through the induction of apoptosis.37, 38 Clearly, energy availability plays a key role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and cell death, and further work is required to elucidate the role of the butyrate pathway in UC and colorectal cancer. A further catabolic pathway activated in Winnie GCs was branched chain amino acid degradation, and this is in concordance with the results of Moriggi et al,39 who highlighted the upregulation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in isoleucine catabolism (Hsd17b10) in mucosal biopsies collected from UC patients. Similarly, Moriggi et al39 identified cytoskeletal rearrangements in colonic epithelial cells, although this was related to alterations in keratins rather than actin remodeling. In contrast to the current study, levels of other specific mitochondrial enzymes, including components of the TCA cycle (Sdha) and fatty acid beta-oxidation (Acadsb) were reduced—changes that were evident only in noninflamed UC cases vs controls.39 These differences between the 2 studies may reflect the differences in inflammatory status or specific response in isolated goblet cells compared with the other types of colonic epithelial cells. Athough the Winnie model of UC has the advantage over human specimens with respect to biological variation, validation of our findings in human UC will elevate the translational impact of our study. Among the large number of mitochondrial proteins affected in the Winnie phenotype were Chchd2, Chchd3, and Chchd6—3 CHCH domain-containing proteins. Chchd3 and Chchd6 are components of the inner membrane MICOS complex, which couples mitochondrial import to the bioenergetic status of the organelle (Modjtahedi et al40). On the other hand, Chchd2 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space in close proximity to the electron transport chain and regulates the activity of complex IV (cytochrome oxidase). Chchd2 is essential for maintaining integrity of the mitochondrial cristae, and Chchd2 mutations cause Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases marked by mitochondrial dysfunction.41, 42 The pro-survival role of Chchd2 has been confirmed in Drosophila and mice, where loss of functional Chchd2 sensitizes cells to ROS-dependent apoptosis via destabilization of cytochrome c.30, 43 In the context of GCs undergoing chronic ER stress, upregulation of Chchd2 may have several important functional consequences, including the attenuation of ROS generation and, importantly, the inhibition of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.23 Interestingly, Chchd2 is a bi-organellar transcription factor that further enhances complex IV activity by stimulating COX4I2 expression.31 The upregulation and translocation of Chchd2 to the nucleus is therefore consistent with the role of Chchd2 as a key survival protein in Winnie GCs undergoing chronic ER stress. It would be interesting to determine whether Chchd2 is also part of a more general pro-survival adaptive mechanism in other pathologies involving cellular stress. Targeted suppression of Chchd2, for example in colorectal cancer, may offer a novel approach to selective elimination of cells under ER stress.
