The topic of gut microbiota is currently attracting considerable interest as a potential factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the extent and time course of alterations in the gut microbiota, and their effects on AD pathology remain uncertain. Herein, we compared the fecal microbiomes and fecal short chain fatty acid composition (SCFAs) between wildtype and AD model mice at different ages under strictly controlled specific pathogen free conditions, and also conducted microscopic investigations of intestinal structures. Our results showed that the microbiota composition and diversity were perturbed and the level of SCFAs was reduced in AD mice, predicting alterations in more than 30 metabolic pathways, which may be associated with amyloid deposition and ultrastructural abnormalities in AD mouse intestine. These findings indicate that AD pathology might not only affect brain function directly, but also exacerbate cognitive deficits through reducing the level of SCFAs via alterations of gut microbiota induced by intestinal amyloid deposition. Our data may support a role of gut microbiota, and suggest a novel route for therapeutic intervention in AD. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Keywords: aging, Alzheimer’s disease, gut microbiota, mouse model, short chain fatty acids20 INTRODUCTION21 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common22 form of neurodegenerative disease among older indi-23 viduals, manifesting not only in cognitive impairment24 but also psychiatric symptoms such as depression25 and anxiety.

Despite much progress 32 in recent years, the comprehensive pathogenesis of 33 AD remains to be elucidated, and so far, no effective 34 treatment has been developed. The existing evidences 35 indicate that many factors, such as aging, inflamma36 tion, obesity, and insulin resistance, are risk factors 37 for AD [1]. 38 The past decade has seen the emergence of 39 an understanding that the microbiome, notably the 40 intestinal microbiota, is a factor influencing human 41 health and disease, being implicated in neuropsy42 chiatric disorders such as depression, autism, and 43 neurodegeneration through effects on the gut-brain 44 axis [2–8]. For example, alterations in gut micro45 biota are now documented in Parkinson’s disease 46 ISSN 1387-2877/17/$35.00 © 2017 – IOS Press and the authors.

The deposition of -synuclein, an underlying47 molecular pathology for nigrostriatal degeneration,48 has been found in enteric neurons in the early phases49 of PD, with consequences for gut motility. More-50 over, the gut mucosa of parkinsonian patients shows51 increased permeability, signs of inflammation and52 invasion of coliform bacteria [9], and hosts an aber-53 rant gut microbiota composition [10]. Recently, using54 mice that overexpress -synuclein, Sampson and55 colleague reported that gut microbiota are required56 for full expression of motor deficits, microglia acti-57 vation, and -synuclein pathology in the brain of58 mice overexpressing -synuclein, thus implicating59 gut microbiome as a risk factor for idiopathic PD [11].60 In the context of AD, many converging lines of61 evidence suggest that the cognitive impairment in62 AD is likewise associated with perturbation of the63 normal gut microbiota [4, 12, 13]. Alterations of64 the gut microbiome might increase intestinal per-65 meability, induce pro-inflammatory responses, and66 favor the development of insulin resistance, which67 has also been associated with risk for AD. Addi-68 tionally, an expanding list of bacteria including69 gram-negative species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas,70 Staphylococcus, Streptomyces, and others, can be71 the sources of amyloid deposits [14–16]. Bacterial72 amyloids might activate signaling pathways known73 to play a role in neurodegeneration and AD patho-74 genesis, while the gut microbiome might enhance75 inflammatory responses to cerebral accumulation of76 A. Furthermore, some gut microbiota can secrete77 lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and other proinflam-78 matory factors into their surrounding environment.79 Lukiw provided the first evidence that Bacteroides80 fragilis (BF-LPS) exposure to human primary brain81 cells is an exceptionally potent inducer of the pro-82 inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB (p50/p65)83 complex, which is a known trigger in the expression84 of pathogenic pathways involved in inflammatory85 degenerative neuropathology in the AD brain [17].86 It has been hinted that diet and specific nutrients87 can affect the composition of the gut microbiota,88 and might influence the production or aggregation of89 amyloid proteins. This scenario predicts that modu-90 lating the gut microbiome through specific nutritional91 interventions and the use of prebiotics and probi-92 otics might represent an effective strategy to reduce93 the level of chronic inflammation associated with94 AD, thus possibly moderating the progression of AD95 symptoms [18]. Recently, it was reported that pro-96 longed shifts in gut microbial species composition97 and diversity induced by a long-term broad-spectrum98 combinatorial antibiotic treatment regime attenuated 99 cerebral A plaque deposition in the APPswe/PS1E9 100 mouse model of AD [19]. Furthermore, Akbari et al. 101 demonstrated that probiotic food consumption for 102 12 weeks positively affects cognitive function and 103 some aspects of metabolic status in human AD 104 patients [20]. As such, the accumulating data strongly 105 hint for a link between gut microbes and AD. How106 ever, the alteration of gut microbial composition and 107 diversity has not yet been confirmed in AD patients 108 or in AD model mice. Thus, we compared the fecal 109 microbiome of an AD male mice model and littermate 110 controls at different ages under specific pathogen-free 111 (SPF) conditions, thus excluding the possible influ112 ences of factors such as diet, weight, gender, cage 113 illumination, living habit, and medications. 114 MATERIALS AND METHODS 115 Animals and sample collection 116 The APPswe/PS1E9 (PAP) transgenic male mice 117 were generated as previously described [21]. Age 118 and weight-matched littermate mice were chosen as 119 the wild-type control (WT). To eliminating the inter120 ference of sex, fresh fecal samples were collected 121 from male mice at 1, 3, 5-6, and 8–12 months of 122 age (n = 6/group) [22]. A total of 48 fecal samples 123 were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 124 –80◦C before analysis. All mice were maintained 125 under SPF and controlled environmental conditions. 126 Our use of experimental animals was in compliance 127 with the Health Guide for Care and Use of Labora128 tory Animals. The study protocol was approved by 129 the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Insti130 tute of Laboratory Animal Science of Peking Union 131 Medical College (QC16004) [23, 24]. 132 DNA extraction and sequencing 133 DNA was extracted from 0.18–0.22 g stool 134 samples using a QIA amp DNA Stool Mini Kit 135 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. 136 The 16SrRNA gene was analyzed to evaluate the 137 bacterial diversity by using Illumina Miseq 2500 138 platform (Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., 139 Ltd). DNA was amplified by using the 341F/806R 140 primer set (341F: 5’-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG141 3’; 806R:5’-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3’), 142 which targets the V3+V4 region of the bacterial 16S 143 rDNA [25]. 144 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of L. Zhang et al. / Altered Gut Microbiota in AD Mice 3 Bioinformatics and statistical analysis145 According to previous reports, the process146 of the bioinformatics and statistical analysis147 (http://h3abionet.org/tools-and-resources/sops/16s-148 rrna-diversity-analysis) [26, 27] is as follows: (1)149 raw tags were assembled through overlap sequences150 of the raw paired-end reads after illumina sequencing151 using Mothur v1.3213; (2) then clean tags were152 obtained by a series of preprocessing, including153 the removal of low quality bases, ambiguous bases154 and adapter sequences, the stitching together of155 paired tags, and the detection of chimeric tags using156 the USEARCH software based on the UCHIME157 algorithm14 [28]; (3) the clean tags were clustered158 into operational taxonomic unit (OTU) based on159 sequence identity. Sequences that were more than160 97% identical were assumed to be derived from161 the same bacterial species. After the sequences162 clustering into OTUs and counting to estimate163 OTU abundance, the most abundant sequence164 was picked as a representative sequence for each165 OUT using Uparse software (Uparse v7.0.1001,166 http://drive5.com/uparse/) [28]; Each OTU was then167 classified by comparison to Mothur and SILVA168 database with aligned, validated and annotated 16S169 rRNA genes; (4) a taxonomic identity was assigned170 to each representative sequence using Mothur and171 SILVA database (http://www.arb-silva.de/). A taxon172 (plural taxa) was any taxonomic grouping, such as173 a phylum, class, order, family, genus or species; (5)174 using PyNAST and GreenGene database, phylogeny175 inference was made based on sequence alignment.176 In downsteam analysis the phylogenetic information177 was used for calculating the Unifrac distance [29];178 (6) alpha diversity, a measure of diversity within179 a sample, gives an indication of richness/diversity180 of species present in a sample. It was measured181 based on the rarefied OTU tables using Mothur182 including cataloging of observed species, Chao1183 [30], Shannon [31], Simpson [32], ACE [33], and184 Good coverage indices [34] (Fig. 1b, Supplementary185 Table 2); (7) beta diversity was performed to measure186 the diversity between samples, including principal187 component analysis (PCA) based on Euclidean dis-188 tance [35], unweighted and weighted Unifrac based189 on phylogenetic distance calculated by UPGMA190 using Mothur [27, 36–39]. Unweighted UniFrac191 measures the distance between two communities by192 calculating the fraction of the branch length in a193 phylogenetic tree that leads to descendants in either,194 but not both, of the two communities [38]; whereas195 weighted UniFrac is a quantitative measure that 196 weights the branches of a phylogenetic tree based 197 on the abundance of information, which is thus of 198 beta diversity that can detect changes in how many 199 sequences from each lineage are present, as well as 200 detect changes in which taxa are present [40]; (8) 201 both alpha and beta diversity were calculated accord202 ing to previous report and analyzed by the Wilcoxon 203 rank-sum test (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2) [27, 204 30, 36–39]. And a two-sided Student’s t-test was 205 used to test for significance of relative abundance of 206 fecal microbiota at genus and species level between 207 sample groups (Fig. 4); (9) linear discriminant 208 analysis (LDA) coupled with effect size (LEfSe), an 209 algorithm for high-dimensional biomarker discovery 210 and explanation, was performed to identify the 211 bacterial taxa differentially represented between 212 groups at the genus or higher taxonomic levels as 213 previously reported [41]. Then LDA scores were 214 used to estimate the effect size of each differentially 215 abundant feature and for biomarker discovery among 216 groups and LDA scores were positive correlated to 217 the effect [41]. Additionally, to demonstrate whether 218 the variations of gut microbiota were associated with 219 age or AD model status, we performed Pearson’s cor220 relation analysis based on the microbial community 221 difference matrix using R Studio software. 222 Microbial function prediction 223 The functional profiles of microbial communi224 ties were predicted by using PICRUSt. The OTUs 225 were mapped to gg13.5 database at 97% similarity 226 by applying QIIME’s command “pick closed otus”. 227 The OTUs abundance was normalized automat228 ically using 16S rRNA gene copy numbers 229 from known bacterial genomes in the Integrated 230 Microbial Genomes (IMG) database. The relevant 231 predicted genes and their function were aligned 232 to KEGG database and the differences among 233 groups were compared with the STAMP software 234 (http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/STAMP). The two235 side Welch’s t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR 236 correction were used in the between-group anal237 ysis. ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer test with 238 the Benjamini-Hochberg correction were chosen for 239 multiple-group analysis [42]. 240 Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) 241 quantification by GC-MS 242 SCFAs were analyzed by GC-MS using an Agilent 243 7890A/5975C instrument equipped with an HP-5MS 244 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of 4 L.

The initial oven temperature248 was held at 60◦C for 5 min, ramped to 250◦C at a249 rate of 10◦C/min, and finally held at this tempera-250 ture for 5 min. The temperature of the front inlet,251 transfer line and electron impact (EI) ion source252 were set as 280, 250, and 230◦C, respectively. Data253 handing was performed with an Agilent’s MSD254 ChemStation [43].255 Morphological examination 256 Intestinal tissue from the mice was fixed by immer257 sion in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded 258 in paraffin. After dewaxing, 4 m thick intestinal 259 sections were cut with a microtome and washed in 260 PBS for H&E staining. The immunohistochemistry 261 procedures were carried out according to conven262 tional methods. In brief, sections were probed with 263 primary antibody: 4G8 (1 : 1000, anti-A17–24, Con264 vance) or anti-A1–42 (ab10148, Abcam) overnight 265 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of L.

Then, the immunoreaction was visualized266 after incubating with the secondary antibody (HRP-267 labeled anti-mouse IgG) and, following 3 washes268 in PBS, addition of DAB (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing,269 China) [21, 44]. ThioflavinT (T3516, Sigma) staining270 was performed by a standard method [45]. Fluo-271 rescence was measured using inverted fluorescence272 microscope (IX71, Olympus) at an excitation wave-273 length of 450 nm and an emission wave length274 of 482 nm.275 Ultrastructural analysis was performed as in pre-276 vious studies. In brief, the intestines were carefully277 dissected and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution278 at 4◦C for 2 h. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained279 with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined280 under JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope281 (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV [21].282 RESULTS283 Characteristics of the high-throughput sequence284 data285 A total of 2,077,384 of V3+V4 16S rRNA286 sequences reads (Taxon Tag) from the 48 samples287 with an average of 38,860 sequences (the minimum288 of one sample was 25,746 and the maximum was289 55,643) reads for each sample were obtained for290 this study. The average length of sequence reads291 was 415 bp, and they were taxonomically classified292 using MGRAST15 (http://metagenomics.anl.gov/)293 (Supplementary Table 1). After OTU picking and294 chimera checking, each sample had an average of295 494 OTUs. The taxon abundance of each sample was296 classified to Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genera,297 and Species levels, mainly using the RDP database,298 aided by the Greengene, and SSU databases. For all299 samples, the species accumulation curve (Fig. 1a)300 showed that samples reached the saturation phase.301 Furthermore, the Good coverage index (Supple-302 mentary Table 2) indicated adequate depth of303 sequencing.304 Changes in bacterial communities in mice with305 advanced ages306 Five alpha diversity measures were calculated,307 including observed species (OTUs) (Fig. 1b), Chao1,308 Shannon, Simpson and ACE’s diversity indices309 (Supplementary Table 2). We found no significant310 difference in the Simpson diversity between the two311 groups at any age. However, OTUs number, Chao1, 312 Shannon, and ACE indices showed higher diversity 313 and richness in 8–12-month-old WT mice (WT8M) 314 when compared with other WT groups. Also, the 315 samples from 8–12-month-old PAP mice (PAP8M) 316 showed significantly increased diversity and richness 317 than did PAP mice at 3 months of age (PAP3M) 318 as indicated by the number of observed species, 319 Chao1, and ACE index, and also greater diversity than 320 1-month-old PAP mice (PAP1M) by the observed 321 species index. The relationships between the com322 munity structures were examined by PCA (Fig. 1c) 323 and unweighted/weighted Unifrac analysis (Fig. 1d, 324 Table 1). It was shown that PC1 can explain 48.43% 325 of the variance and PC2 can explain 17.16% of the 326 variance. The total explanation rate of the two axes 327 reached 65.59%. The samples were clustered into 328 six groups: (1) PAP8M; (2) WT8M; (3) PAP5M; (4) 329 WT5M; (5) PAP3M&WT3M; (6) PAP1M&WT1M. 330 Based on the distribution of the sample point, the WT 331 and PAP group were both separated by age obviously 332 (Fig. 1c). The Unifrac analysis also indicated that the 333 community structures of fecal microbiota differed as 334 a function of age (Fig. 1d, Table 1). 335 Concerning the abundance of Phylaein fecal sam336 ples, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the two most 337 dominant at all ages. The relative abundance of the 338 top ten phyla is shown in Fig. 2a and 2b (Supplemen339 tary Table 3). For 1-month-old mice, the abundance 340 of Firmicutes (WT1M-32%, PAP1M-30%) was sig341 nificantly lower than that of the older mice (>40%). 342 The abundance of Bacteroidetes was conspicuously 343 low at 3 months of age of WT (28%) and AD (30%) 344 mice relative to the other age groups. The ratio of 345 Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was 0.60 (WT) and 0.53 346 (AD) at 1 month of age, increasing more than 3-fold 347 to 2.00 (WT) and 1.65 (AD) at 3 months of age, and 348 then decreasing to 0.99 (WT) and 0.92 (AD) at 5-6 349 months, finally reaching 1.45 (WT) and 1.25 (AD) 350 at 8–12 months of age. Proteobacteria, as the third 351 most abundant Phylum, also showed a dynamic pat352 tern with age, as shown in Fig. 2a and 2b, having 353 a tendency to decrease with age. In addition, the 354 relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Deferrib355 acteres decreased with age for both groups. Notably, 356 Verrucomicrobia was dramatically increased at the 357 oldest mouse age, especially in AD transgenic mice 358 (Fig. 1d, Fig. 2a, b). The top 10 most abundant 359 microbes in mouse stool at the rank of Class (c), Order 360 (d), and Family (e) are shown in Fig. 2. 361 On the genus level, the top 35 differentiated taxa 362 with high relative abundance at different ages were 363 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of 6 L.

In contrast, we saw differential369 representation of 4 taxa in 1-month-old, 3 taxa in370 3-month-old, 4 taxa in 5-6-month-old, and 6 taxa371 in 8–12-month-old AD mice (Fig. 3d) (p < 0.05,372 respectively).373 To be more specific, we further calculated multiple374 comparisons to show the conspicuous group differ-375 ences at each age on the genus (Fig. 4a) and species376 levels (Fig. 4b). Generally, the different genera were377 similar in older and younger WT mice. The signif-378 icantly increased genera in the older mice included379 Oscillospira, Roseburia, Bacteroides, Coprococcus,380 Ruminococcus, Paraprevotella, etc. In contrast, the381 representation of some genera such as Prevotella, Sut-382 terella, Parabacteroides, and Allobaculum reduced383 with age. In terms of the recognized probiotics,384 Bifidobacterium had relatively high abundance in 1-385 month-old WT mice, but no remarkable difference386 between each two groups, as likewise seen for Lacto-387 bacillus (Fig. 3a). The abundance of Ruminococcus388 gnavus (R. gnavus) increased, whereas Parabac-389 teroides distasonis (P. distasonis) decreased with age390 of both WT and AD mice (Fig. 4b). Correlation analy-391 sis showed a significant correlation of gut microbiota392 with age (Pearson’s R = 0.2779, p = 0.0001) (Supple-393 mentary Table 3).394 Functional analysis using PICRUSt indicated that395 more than 50 pathways were predicted from KEGG396 to change with age. In general, microbiota in397 the older mice had lower abundance of pathways398 involved in cell growth and death, immune system,399 metabolism, translation, replication and repair, cel-400 lular processes and signaling, and protein folding,401 sorting, and degradation, while membrane transport402 pathways were over-represented with increasing 403 age (Fig. 5a). 404 Changes in bacterial communities in AD mice 405 Alpha diversity analysis by the Chao1 index 406 revealed significantly higher richness in fecal micro407 biota of 5-6-month-old AD mice than age-matched 408 WT controls (Supplementary Table 2), while 8–12409 month-old AD mice displayed lower diversity than 410 littermate controls by the Shannon index (Supple411 mentary Table 2). The PCA plot showed that the gut 412 microbiota between the WT and PAP group for the 413 younger mice (1M, 3M) were much more similar and 414 the difference enlarged with the age growth (5M, 8M) 415 (Fig. 1c). Additionally, Unifrac analysis showed dis416 tinct bacterial community structures between AD and 417 WT mice at 5-6 and 8–12-months of age (Fig. 1d, 418 Table 1). 419 On the phylum level, the abundance of Pro420 teobacteria in 5-6-month-old AD mice was doubled 421 compared to WT controls (12% versus 6%). The Ver422 rucomicrobia was dramatically increased by 6-fold in 423 8–12-month-old AD mice compared to age-matched 424 WT controls (Fig. 1d, 2a, b). Concerning the genus 425 abundance in feces samples, the hierarchy cluster 426 heat-map revealed the top 35 most abundant differen427 tiated taxa (Fig. 3a). The 10 most abundant microbes 428 in mice stool at the rank of class (c), order (d), and 429 family (e) are shown in Fig. 2. 430 LEfSe analysis displayed three bacterial taxa 431 (Erysipelotrichaceae, Erysipelotrichales, and 432 Erysipelotrichales) that were differentially rep433 resented in 8–12-month-old AD mice compared 434 to the age-matched controls (Fig. 3c) (p < 0.05, 435 respectively) and no differences at other ages. This 436 might indicate the three bacterial taxa could be the 437 bacterial biomarker in 8–12-month-old AD mice. 438 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of L.

Zhang et al. / Altered Gut Microbiota in AD Mice 11 We further corrected for multiple comparisons to439 show significant differences between AD and WT440 mice on the genus and species levels (Fig. 4). When441 compared with age-matched controls, Ruminococcus442 and Butyricicoccus were significantly decreased in443 8–12-month-old AD mice. Among species that could444 be identified, Desulfovibrio C21 c20 was increased445 in 5-6-month-old PAP mice, and the abundance of446 Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (B. pullicaecorum),447 a butyrate producer with probiotic potential, was448 reduced in 8–12-month-old AD mice. In addition, we449 observed the correlation between gut microbiota and450 AD model status (Pearson’s R = 0.2325, p = 0.0037)451 (Supplementary Table 3).452 The functional analysis predicted more than 30453 metabolic and cellular pathways to be altered in454 AD mice. Overall, these results suggested that AD455 mice hosted fewer microbial functions than WT456 mice for many metabolism and biosynthesis pro-457 cesses. However, the AD mice had more functions in458 phosphatidylinositol signaling system, limonene and459 pinene degradation, butanoate/pyruvate metabolism,460 among other pathways (Fig. 5b-d). The observa-461 tions of altered butanoate/pyruvate metabolism and462 decreased abundance of B. pullicaecorum provoked463 us to measure the fecal concentration of SCFAs. As464 Table 2 shows, the SCFAs, including butyric acid and465 isobutyric acid, had a tendency to be lower in both466 feces and brain of AD mice. Interestingly, the level467 of butyric acid in brain correlated positively with that468 in feces (Pearson’s R = 0.8197) (Fig. 5d, Table 2).469 The alterations of gut microbiota in AD may be470 associated with perturbed intestinal structure471 H&E staining showed amyloid deposition (as472 homogeneous red-stained substance) in intestinal473 villous stroma of AD mice (Fig. 6a-c). We fur-474 ther investigated samples from the AD group using475 anti-A immunohistochemistry staining, including476 anti-A1–42 (Fig. 6d, e), 4G8 (Fig. 6f, g), and also477 thioflavine T staining (Fig. 6h-k), to explore the478 characteristics of the homogeneous H&E positive479 substance. Using these methods, we found that A480 deposition could be detected as early as 5 months481 of age in AD mice. The results confirmed the pres-482 ence of A deposition in the intestinal villous stroma.483 Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy also484 showed filamentary structures in the small intestinal485 stroma (Fig. 6o), similar in appearance to the senile486 plaques (Fig. 6l) in hippocampus of AD mice. In487 addition, electronic microscopy results revealed that488 the intestinal villous of AD mice was significantly 489 shorter, sparser, and irregularly arranged (Fig. 6n) 490 when compare with WT mice at five months of age 491 (Fig. 6m). Obvious mitochondrial degeneration was 492 present in the AD group, including mitochondrial 493 swelling, hypertrophy, pykenosis, and crista fragmen494 tation, as well as vacuolar degeneration (Fig. 6n, o). 495 DISCUSSION 496 The present study compared the fecal micro497 biome and SCFAs of WT and AD model mice at 498 different ages. We found that the diversity and micro499 biota composition changed especially at 8–12 month 500 of age. Overall, the abundance of Verrucomicro501 bia and Proteobacteria was dramatically increased, 502 whereas Ruminococcus and Butyricicoccus were sig503 nificantly decreased in 8–12-month-old AD mice 504 compared with age-matched WT controls. Notably, 505 the abundance of B. pullicaecorum, a butyrate pro506 ducer with probiotic potential, was reduced in AD 507 mice. Meanwhile, the functional analysis predicted 508 butanoate/pyruvate metabolism was altered in AD 509 mice. Consistent with this finding, concentrations 510 of the SCFAs, including butyric acid and isobutyric 511 acid, were lower in both feces and brain in AD mice. 512 Interestingly, the level of butyric acid in brain cor513 related positively with that in feces. Additionally, 514 amyloid deposition and ultrastructural abnormalities 515 were observed in AD intestine as early as five months. 516 Based on the above-mentioned overall results, this 517 discussion will emphasize (1) the significant alter518 ation of gut microbiome on the level of phylum, 519 genus, and species with age, with comparison of 520 the similarities and differences in relation to ear521 lier research and prediction of altered function likely 522 associated with age-related changes in microbiome; 523 (2) the changes of gut microbiome in AD mice and the 524 possible function/effects of the altered gut microbiota 525 according to our bioinformatic analysis; (3) spec526 ulation about the possible cause of the altered gut 527 microbiome in AD mice. 528 Emerging evidence indicates a link between gut 529 microbiome with aging and age-related diseases. 530 While human studies provide clinically relevant 531 insight, mouse models are (due to their potential con532 trollability), valuable for researching the association 533 between gut microbiome and host health or disease. 534 Thus, we use the most widely-used mouse AD model 535 to characterize alterations of gut microbiota in AD 536 mice reared under controlled conditions.

Unlike in some 543 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of L. Zhang et al. / Altered Gut Microbiota in AD Mice 13 previous reports, we found that Proteobacteria was544 the third most abundant phylum in mice, but had a545 tendency to decrease in abundance with age. Notably,546 Verrucomicrobia was dramatically increased at the547 older mouse group, especially in the AD model548 transgenic mice. Studies in humans have shown age-549 related declines in the abundance of Eubacteriaceae,550 i.e., Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobac-551 terium [47]. We found virtually no Eubacteriaceae552 within any of our mouse stool samples, and no dif-553 ference in the proportions of Faecalibacterium and554 Lactobacillus across age, in accordance with the data555 of Langille et al. [46]. These species-disparate find-556 ings could be due to characteristic differences in the557 murine and human microbiomes, or could arise due558 to confounding effects of diet or habitat change in559 the study of elderly humans. We indeed noted that the560 genus Bifidobacterium had relatively high abundance561 in 1-month-old WT mice, but with no significant562 difference between AD and WT groups. Addition-563 ally, our data revealed that the relative abundance564 of Oscillospira, Roseburia, Bacteroides, Coprococ-565 cus, Ruminococcus, and Paraprevotella were higher566 in older mice, irrespective of genotype. Abundance of567 R. gnavus was increased and P. distasonis decreased568 in the older WT and PAP mice. As KEGG analysis569 predicted, these age-related changes in microbiome570 may have effects on diverse processes, including cell571 growth and death, the immune system, metabolism,572 DNA translation, replication and repair, cellular pro-573 cesses and signaling, as well as protein folding,574 sorting, and degradation [3]. Any of these changes575 may be factors influencing the aging phenotype, with576 potential effects in the central nervous system.577 Moreover, we found distinct differences in gut578 microbiota in AD and WT mice. On the phylum level,579 the abundance of Proteobacteria in 5-6-month-old580 AD mice was double that in WT controls. Proteobac-581 teria have been reported to have an association with582 immunological reactions and inflammation, which583 are two known factors relating to AD pathogenesis584 [48]. Park et al. indicated that rearing of mice with a585 Western-style diet plus rifaximim treatment induces a586 significant dysbiosis with a bloom of Proteobacteria587 and ileal inflammation [49]. Moreover, an increase588 of Proteobacteria has also been described in irrita-589 ble bowel syndrome (IBS), which is itself associated590 with an increased risk of dementia [50].591 The newly identified phylum Verrucomicrobia was592 dramatically increased by 6-fold in 8–12-month-old593 AD mice relative to age-matched controls. Verru-594 comicrobia possess several unusual features, such595 as the presence of a eukaryotic-like tubulin and a 596 functional SOS response [51]. But interest in this 597 phylum has grown in recent years due mainly to 598 metagenomics analyses revealing its association with 599 several eukaryotic hosts. Indeed, Verrucomicrobia is 600 reported to play a significant role in the adaptability of 601 the human gut microbiome, and Sait et al. has found 602 that it is even capable of pathogenic activity toward 603 an invertebrate host [52]. We now report that Akker604 mansiamuciniphila (A. muciniphila), belonging to 605 Verrucomicrobia, had relatively high abundance in 606 older AD mice. In the normal gastrointestinal tract, 607 this species degrades mucin and oligosaccharides, 608 to produce SCFAs, respectively, which are carbon 609 sources for aerobic energy metabolism in the host, 610 and also promote colonization of the bacterium. The 611 presence of A. muciniphila in the gut is negatively 612 associated with obesity and intestinal inflamma613 tory diseases (IBD) [53]. However, another report 614 showed increased populations of A. muciniphila in 615 patients with ulcerative colitis-associated pouchitis 616 [54]. Concentrations of A. muciniphila were also 617 significantly increased in fecal samples from colon 618 cancer patients [55]. All this considered, we suppose 619 that A. muciniphila-induced mucin degradation will 620 increase intestinal mucosa permeability, with poten621 tial consequences for cognitive function propagating 622 through the brain-gut axis. 623 LEfSe analysis displayed three bacterial taxa 624 (Erysipelotrichi Class, Erysipelotrichales Order, 625 and Erysipelotrichaceae Family) to be differen626 tially represented in 8–12-month-old AD mice. The 627 Erysipelotrichi class of bacteria within the Firmi628 cutes phylum has been reported to increase in mice 629 reared with western diet and in human cases of IBD 630 [56, 57]. A similar increase in Erysipelotrichales has 631 been found in mice reared on a high-fat diet. Mag632 nusson and colleagues have provided evidence that 633 an increase in this order can impact cognition [58], 634 thus possibly contributing to the cognitive deficits in 635 AD. On the other hand, Buffington et al. revealed 636 that Erysipelotrichales abundance moderated against 637 maternal diet-induced social and synaptic deficits 638 in offspring [59], indicating a complex role of 639 Erysipelotrichi in cognitive function. 640 Compared with age-matched controls, the 8–12641 month-old AD mice had significantly decreased 642 Ruminococcus and Butyricicoccusalbus populations. 643 Among species that could be identified, Desulfovibrio 644 C21 c20 was increased in 5-6-month-old AD mice, 645 and B. pullicaecorum was reduced in 8–12-month646 old AD mice. Ruminococcus is another organism 647 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of 14 L. Zhang et al. / Altered Gut Microbiota in AD Mice considered to modulate mucin expression or degra-648 dation, with effects on IBD [60]. In particular, R.649 gnavus ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 strains have650 been demonstrated to use terminal mucin glycans to651 degrade mucin, similarly to Akkermansia, whereas652 strains such as R. gnavus E1 were shown to increase653 the expression of mucin and the intestinal glycosy-654 lation level, thus representing a beneficial bacterial655 strain for the host [61–63]. As noted above, R. gnavus656 was increased in older WT and AD mice, but metage-657 nomic analysis would be necessary to ascertain if658 there are relevant strain differences in WT and AD659 mice.660 We are particularly struck by the decrease abun-661 dance among AD mice in B. pullicaecorum, a662 butyrate producer with probiotic potential [64].663 In recent years, B. pullicaecorum abundance was664 reported to be reduced in human IBD patients, which665 itself an increased risk of dementia [46]. Further-666 more, inoculation with B. pullicaecorum remarkably667 rescued intestinal injury in IBD patients, seemingly668 through increased production of butyrate [64, 65].669 Indeed, it is clear that butyrate, by virtue of its HDAC670 inhibition, is poised to exert potent neuropharmaco-671 logical effects on synaptic function in AD [66–68].672 Our present PICRUSt analysis predicted that AD673 mice hosted more microbial functions in relation674 to the butyrate metabolite butanoate. This elevated675 metabolism is apt to decrease cerebral butyrate lev-676 els, which may be a factor compromising cognition677 in AD.678 Recently, Brandscheid et al. [69] analyzed the679 whole bacterial phyla and other four bacteria (Akker-680 mansia muciniphila, the genus Bifidobacterium,681 Escherichia coli, and the Clostridium leptum group)682 by PCR amplification in another AD model, namely683 5xFAD mice. They found no difference between684 5xFAD and WT mice in populations of several bac-685 teria, i.e., the Bifidobacterium and Escherichia coli.686 On the other hand, they did observe other changes687 at the age of nine weeks of age; the amount of688 Firmicutes and the Clostridium leptum group was689 increased in the 5xFAD model mice while Bac-690 teroidetes were decreased in comparison to the WT691 littermates. In line with present findings, another692 recent report showed Ruminococcus to be signifi-693 cantly decreased in APP/PS1 mice. However, that694 study also reported the abundance of Helicobac-695 teraceae and Desulfovibrionaceae at the family696 level; Odoribacter and Helicobacter at the genus697 level and Coriobacteriaceae increased significantly698 in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT mice, while699 Prevotella abundance decreased [70]. It is beyond 700 dispute that the gut microbiota is inherently diverse, 701 and its composition changes due to various fac702 tors, including, but not limited to the specific AD 703 model, experimental method, breeding environment, 704 even regional differences. As such, it is important to 705 identify general principles relating gut flora to AD 706 models. Furthermore, we consider it noteworthy that 707 Cattano and colleagues recently revealed an associ708 ation between pro-inflammatory gut bacterial taxa 709 and peripheral inflammation markers as well as brain 710 amyloidosis in cognitively-impaired elderly subjects 711 [71]. In particular, they found increased abundance 712 of Escherichia/Shigella, and reduced abundance of 713 an anti-inflammatory taxon, Eubacteriumrectale, in 714 stool of AD patients, which we did not observe in the 715 present mouse study. This may reflect species dif716 ferences between mice and humans, or could reflect 717 diverse confounding factors such as diet, weight, 718 gender, habitat, emotional state, living habits, med719 ication status, or comorbid diseases in the clinical 720 study. 721 Concerning the possible role of gut microbiota 722 in the AD clinical course, we might suppose that 723 perturbed gut microbiota was not a primary defect 724 leading to AD, but arose secondary to systemic fac725 tors such as amyloidosis, and then contributed to 726 the cognitive impairment of AD. The transgenic AD 727 model mice used in the present study are known to 728 display impairments in spatial learning and mem729 ory, first evident at 3 months of age, and progressing 730 thereafter [72]. Whereas the present AD mouse strain 731 exhibits the first discernible cerebral amyloid depo732 sition at 4-5 months of age [72], we detected A 733 deposition in the intestinal villous stroma at 5 months 734 of age. The later amyloid deposition in AD intes735 tine may be caused by the mutant APP gene. In 736 the present study, the amyloid deposition and ultra737 structural injury of intestinal tract was first seen 738 at 5 months of age, coincident with onset of dis739 tinct differences in fecal microbiota of the AD mice. 740 Thus, we speculate that structural and functional 741 abnormalities in the intestine may influence in turn 742 the colonization and homeostasis of intestinal flora. 743 Population changes of certain taxa might indepen744 dently exacerbate cognitive defects through their 745 effects on specific metabolic pathways, notable when 746 there is a net reduction in SCFA levels. Certainly, 747 much work is needed to verify this hypothesis and 748 clarify the relationship between microbiome alter749 ation and AD. We present preliminary evidence 750 for a mechanism by which microbiome changes in 751 U nc or re ct ed A ut ho r P ro of L.
