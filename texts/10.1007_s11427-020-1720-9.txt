However, precisely how T cells regulate intestine immunity remains to be fully understood. In this study, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2) is required for the CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammation in the intestine. Using a T cell transfer colitis model, we found that MAP3K2-deficient naïve CD4+ T cells had a dramatically reduced ability to induce colitis compared to wild type T cells. In addition, significantly fewer IFN-γbut more IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells in the intestines of mice receiving MAP3K2deficient T cells than in those from mice receiving wild type T cells was observed. Interestingly, under well-defined in vitro differentiation conditions, MAP3K2-deficient naïve T cells were not impaired in their ability to differentiate into Th1, Th17 and Treg. Furthermore, the MAP3K2-regulated colitis severity was mediated by Th1 but not Th17 cells in the intestine. At the molecular level, we showed that MAP3K2-mediated Th1 cell differentiation in the intestine was regulated by IL-18 and required specific JNK activation. Together, our study reveals a novel regulatory role of MAP3K2 in intestinal T cell immunity via the IL18-MAP3K2-JNK axis and may provide a novel target for intervention in T cell-mediated colitis.

Proper control of intestinal immunity is crucial for function and health of the intestine since its perturbation will lead to various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (Kaser et al., 2010; Uhlig and Powrie, 2018). Disorders of intestinal homeostasis are directly associated with the occurrence of IBDs, including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (Maloy and Powrie, 2011; Ungaro et al., 2017). Local intestinal immunity is tightly controlled by interactions among intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020 life.scichina.com link.springer.com SCIENCE CHINA Life Sciences *Corresponding authors (Zhengting Wang, email: zhengtingwang@shsmu.edu.cn; Bing Su, email: bingsu@sjtu.edu.cn) and intestinal microorganisms (Martin et al., 2019; Schneider et al., 2018). Local intestinal immunity also plays an important role in regulating the systemic immune response and tolerance (Kabat et al., 2014; Kamada et al., 2013; Peterson and Artis, 2014; Soderholm and Pedicord, 2019). Among the immune cells in the gut, T cells play a major role in maintaining intestinal immunity and homeostasis by interacting with other cells in the lamina propria. Multiple subsets of CD4+ T cells have been discovered, including regulatory T (Treg) cells (Sakaguchi et al., 1995), T helper 1 (Th1) cells (Dong and Flavell, 2000; Mosmann et al., 1986), Th2 cells (Dong and Flavell, 2000; Mosmann et al., 1986), and Th17 cells (Dong, 2006; Mucida et al., 2007; Weaver et al., 2006), each of which has its own unique functions in regulating CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity. Perturbation of these T cell responses in the gut is known to be the major cause of many intestinal diseases, such as IBD and colorectal cancer (Castro-Dopico et al., 2019; Kaser et al., 2010; Senda et al., 2019; Smillie et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2015a). Among these cells, Th1 and Th17 cells are proposed to have proinflammatory roles, whereas Treg cells have been shown to inhibit intestinal inflammation (Castro-Dopico et al., 2019; Izcue et al., 2009; van Wijk and Cheroutre, 2010; Wang et al., 2018). In clinical studies, elevated numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells were found in peripheral blood and intestinal tissue specimens from IBD patients compared to the levels in the respective samples from healthy donors (Kamada et al., 2010; Kobayashi et al., 2008; Parronchi et al., 1997). The local cytokine milieu plays a vital role in maintaining the homeostasis of the intestine. Abnormal levels of inflammatory cytokines were found in the inflamed intestines of IBD patients (Neurath, 2014; Sanchez-Munoz et al., 2008). Many inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL17A, IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-18, participate in intestinal inflammation (Bevivino and Monteleone, 2018; Monteleone et al., 1999; Neurath, 2014), but the precise mechanisms by which they regulate local intestinal immunity remain to be fully understood. Although neutralizing antibodies against TNF-α have been clinically verified and proven successful for the treatment of IBD (Weisshof et al., 2016), only fractions of patients are responsive to this treatment, and the clinical benefit of neutralizing antibodies against other inflammatory cytokines remains to be fully investigated (Neurath, 2014; Sands et al., 2004; Torres et al., 2017). IL-18 is a member of the IL-1 family (Okamura et al., 1995a). It was first described as an IFN-γ-inducing factor (Okamura et al., 1995b; Ushio et al., 1996) capable of promoting the type 1 immune response by inducing IFN-γ production in T cells and natural killer cells (NK cells) (Fantuzzi et al., 1999; Micallef et al., 1996; Novick et al., 2013). IL-18 was mainly induced in intestinal macrophages and epithelial cells in IBD patients (Nowarski et al., 2015). IL-18 expression is upregulated in mucosal intestinal tissue of IBD patients (Monteleone et al., 1999), but its role in regulating intestinal inflammation and homeostasis is still not fully understood. In a TNBS-induced mouse colitis model, blockade of endogenous IL-18 ameliorated the symptoms of colitis by decreasing local TNF-α production (Ten Hove et al., 2001). Similarly, blocking the IL-18 signal also protected mice from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis (Sivakumar et al., 2002). However, other studies have revealed a protective role of IL-18 signaling in intestinal inflammation (Nowarski et al., 2015; Zaki et al., 2010). Therefore, the in vivo function and molecular mechanism of IL-18 action in regulating intestinal immunity remains to be fully studied. Effector CD4+ Th cell differentiation is collectively controlled by multiple signals from the tissue environment in addition to canonical cytokine signals. Among these are Tolllike receptor (TLR) signals and pro-inflammatory cytokine signals that act to either enhance or suppress Th cell differentiation (Fukata et al., 2008; LaRosa et al., 2008; Reynolds and Dong, 2013; Zhou et al., 2009). Among the TLRs, TLR2 activation has been shown to promote IL-2, IFN-γ and IL17A production and suppress IL-4 production (Hu et al., 2013; Imanishi et al., 2007; Komai-Koma et al., 2004), whereas TLR4 signaling could promote IL-17A production but suppress IFN-γ production (González-Navajas et al., 2010; Reynolds and Dong, 2013; Reynolds et al., 2012). Interestingly, it was found that IL-12 and IL-18 could act together to induce IFN-γ production in CD4+ T cells (Munk et al., 2011). These studies suggest that multiple in vivo factors are involved in promoting CD4+ T cell differentiation into IFN-γ-producing effector cells, although the precise regulatory mechanisms are still not fully understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are conserved serine/threonine protein kinases (Sun et al., 2015b; Ten Hove et al., 2001) capable of transducing a wide spectrum of extracellular cues to control important cellular functions such as cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, stress response and apoptosis (Arthur and Ley, 2013; Chang and Karin, 2001; Chang et al., 2011). MAPKs are activated through a cascade that typically consists of a MAPK kinase (MAP2K) and a MAP2K kinase (MAP3K). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2) is a member of the MAP3K family with known roles in T cell activation, effector T cell differentiation and macrophage TLR signaling (Banerjee et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2000; Su et al., 2001; Wen et al., 2015). MAP3K2 also mediates fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signals in osteoblasts for bone formation (Greenblatt et al., 2016). Interestingly, MAP3K2 expression was found to be increased significantly in colorectal cancer (Jiang et al., 2013). MAP3K2 is constitutively expressed in the intestine, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which MAP3K2 functions in intestinal immunity and inflammation remain to be fully elu390 Wu, N., et al. Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 cidated. In this study, we generated T cell-specific Map3k2-conditional knockout (KO) mice to investigate the Tcell-specific role of MAP3K2 in vivo in the intestine. These mice had normal T cell development in the thymus, a phenotype similar to that found in germlineMap3k2-KOmice (Guo et al., 2002). Peripheral T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes were also not affected inMap3k2-conditional KO mice. However, using a T cell transfer mouse colitis model, we showed that MAP3K2 is required for T cell-mediated colitis, in which it facilitates Th1 cell differentiation. Although MAP3K2 was not required for Th1 cell differentiation in vitro under welldefined conditions, it was required for Th1 cell differentiation in the intestine and colitis development. We further reveal at the molecular level that the augmented Th1 response in the intestine is mediated by a previously unknown IL-18MAP3K2-JNK pathway. Overall, our study unravels a novel in vivo function of MAP3K2 by mediating the IL-18 signal to augment Th1 differentiation in colitis development. RESULTS MAP3K2 is constitutively expressed in different types of cells in the intestine Map3k2 has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed in various organs at the mRNA level (Greenblatt et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2013; Mirza et al., 2014; Su et al., 2001; Yue et al., 2014), but its expression at the protein level has not been examined. Using a MAP3K2-specific antibody and MAP3K2 deficiency spleen cells as a negative control, we showed that MAP3K2 was expressed in multiple tissues and organs, including the stomach, small intestine, colon, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) (Figure S1A in Supporting Information). When examining MAP3K2 expression in different cell types, we found that it was widely expressed in T cells, B cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and among these cells the T cells showed high expression of MAP3K2 (Figure S1B in Supporting Information), suggesting a potentially critical role of MAP3K2 in T cell-mediated immunity. Generation of Map3k2 conditional knockout mice To study the in vivo role ofMap3k2 specifically in T cells, we generated a Map3k2 floxed mouse line (Map3k2fl/fl) by inserting two loxP sequences flanking exon 5 of the Map3k2 gene (Figure S1C in Supporting Information). By crossing these mice with a T cell-specific Cd4Cre line (Sawada et al., 1994), we generated T cell-specificMap3k2-KO mice (these mice will be referred to as Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice throughout the paper). To confirm T cell-specific deletion of theMap3k2 gene in these mice, we sorted CD4+ T cells from the spleens of wild type controlMap3k2fl/flmice and Cd4Cre: Map3k2fl/flmice for PCR genotyping analyses. CD19+ B cells were also sorted from these mice as a tissue-specific control. As shown in Figure S1D in Supporting Information, recombination of the Map3k2 allele (Δflox allele) occurred only in CD4+ T cells from Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/flmice but not in CD4+ T cells from control mice or in B cells from either wild type mice or Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice (Figure S1D in Supporting Information). Furthermore, Tcell-specific deletion of MAP3K2 was verified at the protein level by immunoblotting, further confirming T cell-specific deletion of Map3k2 (Figure S1E in Supporting Information). MAP3K2 is dispensable for the generation of thymic and peripheral T cells Previously, we used germlineMap3k2-KO mice to show that deletion of Map3k2 had no obvious impact on thymic and peripheral T cells (Chang et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2002). Using Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice, we confirmed these results from our previous study by showing that the thymic cellularity, subset percentages, and total cell number of thymic T cells in Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice and control littermate Map3k2fl/fl mice were comparable (Figure S1F–H in Supporting Information). Total numbers of T cells were comparable in the spleen and lymph nodes from Cd4Cre: Map3k2fl/fl and control Map3k2fl/fl mice (Figure S1I in Supporting Information). The percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets in these mice, including the effector memory T cells (CD44hiCD62Llo), central memory T cells (CD44hiCD62Lhi), and naïve T cells (CD44loCD62Lhi), were also comparable (Figure S1J and K in Supporting Information). Together, these results demonstrate that MAP3K2 is not required for thymic and peripheral T cell development and differentiation in homeostatic conditions. MAP3K2 promotes T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation Similar to germline Map3k2-KO mice, Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice bred and grew normally, as control Map3k2fl/fl mice (data not shown). Therefore, we investigated the in vivo role of MAP3K2 in T cells in regulating intestinal inflammation using a well-established naïve CD4+ T cell transfer colitis mouse model for IBD (Kiesler et al., 2015; Powrie et al., 1994). CD4+ T cell-induced colitis is mainly mediated by Th1 or Th17 responses due to the lack of Treg cells in the host (Kiesler et al., 2015; Mizoguchi, 2012; Sun et al., 2015a; van Wijk and Cheroutre, 2010). Naïve T cells (CD4+CD25− CD45RBhiCD44loCD62Lhi) from the spleen and lymph nodes of controlMap3k2fl/fl mice or Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice were sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) 391Wu, N., et al. Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 and adoptively transferred intraperitoneally (i.p.) (4×105 per mouse) into Rag2−/− mice to induce colitis for about 5 weeks (Figure 1A) (Kiesler et al., 2015; Mizoguchi, 2012). The body weights of these mice were recorded every 5 days. Fifteen to twenty days after naïve CD4+ T cell transfer, mice that received control wild typeMap3k2fl/fl naïve T cells began to show weight loss, while mice that received similar numbers of naïveMap3k2-KO T cells had almost no loss of body weight, and this became more obvious 4 weeks after T cell transfer (Figure 1B). At the end of week 5 (day 35), the ileum and colon of these mice were assessed for pathological changes by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells exhibited much less epithelial damage and fewer leukocyte infiltration in both the ileum and colon than those receiving wild type T cells (Figure 1C). Consistently, the overall histological scores of intestinal tissues in the mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells were also lower than those in mice receiving wild type T cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, the expression of inflammatory genes Il6, Tnf, and Il1b in the ileum and colon of the mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells was also lower than that in the mice receiving wild type T cells (Figure 1E). On the other hand, Il18 expression was the same in the ileum and colon of mice receiving either wild type naïve or Map3k2-KO T cells (Figure 1E). Taken together, the above data strongly suggest that MAP3K2 is required for effector Tcell function in colitis development. MAP3K2 is not required for T cell differentiation in vitro Although our previous studies using germline Map3k2-KO mice showed no effector T cell differentiation defect, deletion of both MAP3K2 and MAP3K3 in T cells led to augmented Treg and Th17 cell differentiation with reduced Th1 cell differentiation (Chang et al., 2011). However, similar experiments have not been performed with T cellspecific Map3k2-KO mice thus far. To examine whether T cell-specific deletion of MAP3K2 may impact CD4+ T helper cell differentiation in vitro, naïve CD4+ T cells (CD4+CD25−CD44loCD62Lhi) from Map3k2fl/fl or Cd4Cre: Map3k2fl/fl mice were differentiated under well-defined Th1, Th17 or Treg differentiation conditions, and the percentages of these T cell subsets were determined. As shown in Figure S2A–D in Supporting Information, T cell-specific deletion of MAP3K2 had no impact on the differentiation of these T helper cells, consistent with the results obtained from the T cells of germline Map3k2-KO mice from our previous study (Chang et al., 2011). Consistently, we found no significant difference in the percentages of CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells (Th1), CD4+IL-4+ T cells (Th2), and CD4+IL-17A+ T cells (Th17) in the spleen and lymph nodes of the control Map3k2fl/fl and Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice (Figure S2E and F in Supporting Information). Furthermore, the number and percentage of Treg cells (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) were also not affected in these mice (Figure S2G and H in Supporting Information). MAP3K2 augments Th1 cell differentiation in intestinal inflammation The impaired ability of naïve Map3k2-KO T cells to induce colitis in Rag2−/− recipient mice may suggest a defect in the proliferation, migration, or differentiation of naïve Map3k2KO Tcells in the intestinal environment. To investigate these possibilities, we first determined the number of CD4+ T cells in the mLN and colon, and found that the total CD4+ T cell number was comparable in the mLN and colon of mice receiving wild type orMap3k2-KO Tcells at day 35 after T cell transfer (Figure 2A). We next examined the proliferation of wild type and Map3k2-KO CD4+ T cells by measuring the frequencies of Ki67+ CD4+ T cells among total CD4+ T cells, and we found the same percentage of Ki67+ CD4+ T cells in mLN and colon of mice receiving either wild type or Map3k2-KO T cells (Figure 2B and C). These data suggest that MAP3K2 deficiency may not affect CD4+ T cell proliferation in vivo. To assess the migration potential of wild type CD4+ T cells and Map3k2-KO CD4+ T cells, we mixed tdTomato+ (wild type) CD4+ T cells sorted from a mTmG mouse (Muzumdar et al., 2007) with CD4+ T cells from Map3k2-KO mice at roughly 1:1 ratio. The mixed T cells (2×106 cells per mouse) were transferred into Rag2−/− mice intraperitoneally. After 24 h, the ratio of wild type tdTomato+ and Map3k2-KO CD4+ T cells in mLN and colons were determined by flow cytometry, and the ratio maintained the same as that before they were transferred (Figure S3A and B in Supporting Information). Together, these data show that MAP3K2 does not affect CD4+ T cell proliferation or migration in our study. Thus the above data suggest that MAP3K2 deficiency may affect the effector T cell differentiation after adoptive transfer to Rag2−/− mice. To investigate this possibility, we determined the frequencies of IFN-γ+ producing CD4+ T cells and IL-17A+ producing CD4+ T cells in the mLN and colon of mice receiving either naïve wild type or Map3k2KO T cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2D and E, the frequency of CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes of mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells was significantly lower than that in mice receiving wild type T cells (14.2% versus 30.0%). A more striking reduction in Th1 cells was found in lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) from the colon of mice receivingMap3k2-KO Tcells than in those of mice receiving wild type T cells (12.9% versus 42.1%) (Figure 2D and E). Interestingly, the number of CD4+IL17A+ T cells was elevated in both mLN and LPLs in mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells compared to those in mice receiving wild type T cells (Figure 2D and E). Consistently, 392 Wu, N., et al. Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 the Ifng level in the ileum and colon of mice receiving Map3k2-KO Tcells was also reduced compared to that in the mice receiving wild type T cells, whereas the Il17a level was increased (Figure 2F). Together, these data reveal that Map3k2 promotes Th1 but may inhibit Th17 cell differentiation in the course of intestinal inflammation. IL-18 promotes Th1 differentiation via the MAP3K2 signaling pathway IFN-γ is a well-known proinflammatory factor and a known IBD risk factor (Jostins et al., 2012; Khor et al., 2011). The role of IL-17A in intestinal inflammation is more complex Figure 1 MAP3K2 promotes the T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation.

Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 than that of IFN-γ. Some reports suggest that IL-17A promotes intestinal inflammation (Jin and Dong, 2013; Leppkes et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2006b), whereas other studies show a protective role of IL-17A in intestinal colitis, in which it has been shown to promote IEC repair or modulate the Th1 cell response (De Simone et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015; O’Connor Jr et al., 2009). Since damaged intestines may release factors that could potentially act on the MAP3K2 signaling pathway to induce the Th1 response, we investigated the underlying mechanism of MAP3K2-mediated regulation of Th1 cell differentiation in the intestine. We therefore examined several potential stimuli for their ability to trigger the Map3k2-mediated Th1 cell response, including IL-1β, reactive oxygen species (ROS), TNF-α, LPS, Pam3CSK4, TGF-β, and IL-18. Naïve CD4+ T cells from Map3k2fl/fl or Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice were differentiated under well-defined condition into Th1 cells in vitro in the presence or absence of these factors. Under the welldefined Th1 differentiation condition, naïve wild type and Map3k2-KO T cells had similar Th1 differentiation as exFigure 2 MAP3K2 promotes Th1 cells and inhibits Th17 cells during intestinal inflammation.

To our surprise, in vitro Th1 differentiation was significantly increased by the addition of IL-18 to wild type CD4 cells (18.0% to 28.4%), but this augmented Th1 differentiation by IL-18 was not observed in Map3k2-KO T cells (17.4% to 20.6%) (Figure 3C and D). Consistently, IL-18 augmented Tbx21 (T-bet) expression in wild type differentiated Th1 cells but not inMap3k2-KO Th1 cells under the same in vitro differentiation condition (Figure 3E).

Error bars indicate the mean±SEM (**, P<0.01, ***, P<0.001 by unpaired Student’s t test). 395Wu, N., et al. Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 strate that IL-18, but not other pro-inflammatory signals tested above is required for the Map3k2-dependent augmentation of Th1 cell differentiation. The MAP3K2-JNK signaling axis is required for IL-18mediated augmentation of Th1 cell differentiation MAP3K2 is capable of activating multiple downstream MAPKs, including JNK, ERK1/2, ERK5 and p38, in different experimental settings (Chang et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2002; Kesavan et al., 2004). To determine which downstream MAPKs may be involved inMap3k2-mediated IL-18 signaling in Th1 cell differentiation, wild type and Map3k2KO CD4+ T cells were stimulated with IL-18, and MAPK activities were determined at different time points by immunoblotting. In wild type T cells, IL-18 was able to induce significant JNK activation and, to a lesser extent, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation. However, inMap3k2-KO T cells, JNK activation was almost completely blocked, while ERK1/2 and p38 activation was minimally affected (Figure 4A and B). To confirm that the IL-18-mediated Th1 cell differentiation requires JNK activation, we differentiated Th1 cells in vitro in the presence of a JNK inhibitor. As shown in Figure 4C, the IL-18-augmented Th1 differentiation was clearly blocked by the JNK inhibitor (Figure 4C and D). These results indicate that JNK, but not other MAPKs, may be the key downstream kinase responsible for the Map3k2-mediated IL-18 signaling to promote Th1 cell differentiation. MAP3K2 promotes T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation via type I T cell response Since increased Th17 cells but decreased Th1 cells were observed in the intestine of mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells, we next asked whether the increase in Th17 cells could explain the reduced colitis, given the possible protective role of IL-17A in intestinal inflammation (O’Connor Jr et al., 2009). We again used the naïve T cell transfer colitis model with an anti-IL-17A neutralizing antibody (10 µg per mouse) or an isotype matched control antibody (10 µg per mouse) that was administered every 5 days beginning on the first day ofMap3k2-KO naïve T cell transfer. As shown in Figure 5A, the two groups of mice receiving either the control antibody or the anti-IL-17A neutralizing antibody had exactly the same degree of colitis (Figure 5A). Leukocyte infiltration and epithelial integrity were also comparable in the mice treated with these antibodies (Figure 5B and C). The expression of the inflammatory genes Il6 and Tnf in the ileum and colon from these mice was also comparable (Figure 5D). To ensure that the anti-IL-17A antibody worked in this experiment, we measured the expression of the known IL-17A downstream target genes Cxcl2 (Liu et al., 2019) and Cxcl5 (Guilloteau et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2014) and showed that their expression was indeed inhibited in the anti-IL-17A antibody treated mice but not in control antibody-treated mice (Figure 5D). Together, these data show that the increased IL-17A expression in the intestine of mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells is unlikely the cause of reduced colitis. The above results thus strongly suggest that the reduced colitis in mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells is due to reduced Th1 cell differentiation and IFN-γ production. To further confirm this possibility, we administered recombinant (r)IFN-γ at a dose of 5,000 U per mouse to the mice receiving naïveMap3k2-KO T cells to determine if this would exacerbate the severity of colitis. Compared to control group mice, which were only treated with PBS, the rIFN-γtreated mice showed much worse colitis as measured by the loss of body weight, leukocyte infiltration, and epithelial damage (Figure 5E–G). Consistently, the expression levels of Il6 and Tnf (Figure 5H) and the rIFN-γ downstream target genes Defb1(Kallsen et al., 2012) and Cxcl0 (King et al., 2009) (Figure 5H) were also up-regulated in the intestine of the mice treated with rIFN-γ. Together, these data confirm that MAP3K2 is required for generating a proper Th1 during colitis progression. DISCUSSION Proper control of intestinal immunity is essential for the health of the intestine, as it balances pro-inflammatory T cells and immuno-regulatory cells (Izcue et al., 2009; Neurath, 2014). In this study, we revealed a novel T cellspecific role of MAP3K2 in regulating the CD4+ T cellmediated immune response in the intestine. Although T cellspecific deletion of MAP3K2 did not affect thymic and peripheral T cell development and differentiation in vivo or effector T cell differentiation in vitro, differentiation of Map3k2-KO naïve T cells in the intestine of Rag2−/− mice was significantly impaired, and compared with mice receiving wild type naïve T cells, mice receiving Map3k2-KO naïve T cells had fewer IFN-γbut more IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria of the intestine and much milder colitis. Although the Rag2−/− mice receivingMap3k2KO naïve T cells developed more Th17 effector cells than those mice receiving wild type naïve T cells, we showed that IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells but not IL-17A-expressing Th17 cells were responsible for the observed severity of colitis. Furthermore, we revealed a novel IL-18-mediated MAP3K2JNK signaling axis critically required for CD4+ Th1 cell differentiation in the intestine. Our study may provide a novel target for intervention in T cell-mediated colitis. Interestingly, in addition to the Tcell transfer colitis model, we also used a DSS-induced colitis model to test T cellspecific roles in IBD development but found that similar 396 Wu, N., et al. Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 degrees of colitis developed in mice receiving control Map3k2fl/fl cells and mice receiving Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl cells as measured by body weight loss, stool scores, colon length changes, and tissue damage (data not shown). These data suggest that T cell-specific Map3k2 function may not be involved in acute colitis development in mice or that its deficiency may impact the function of both anti-inflammatory T cells (Treg) and pro-inflammatory T cells (Th1 or Th17 cells). We previously showed that Map3k2’s function in regulating T cell differentiation could be compensated by its paralog Map3k3 by using germline Map3k2-KO mice (Chang et al., 2011). In the current study, we used T cells from Map3k2 conditional KO mice and confirmed that deletion of Map3k2 in T cells had no major impact on the overall homeostasis of T cells in the thymus or in the periphery. Consistent with our previous findings, the current study also confirmed that deletion ofMap3k2 in T cells does not augment Th17 or Treg cell differentiation in vitro, but interestingly, it seems to promote Th17 cell differentiation in vivo (Figure 2D). This increased Th17 response could be due to two possibilities. First, this could be due to the previously known TGF-β-dependent mechanism, probably involving the partial inhibition of Smad2/3 link region phosphorylation due to Map3k2 deletion (Chang et al., 2011). The other possibility is the lack of feedback loop regulation induced by the reduced IFN-γ activity inMap3k2-KO Tcells, since it has been shown before that IFN-γ is able to suppress Th17 cell differentiation (Chang et al., 2011; Dong, 2008). Nevertheless, blockade of IL-17A signaling with an anti-IL17A Figure 4 The MAP3K2-JNK signaling axis is required for IL-18-mediated augmentation of Th1 cell differentiation. A, Naïve CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CD25−CD44loCD62Lhi) sorted from the spleens of Map3k2fl/fl or Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice were differentiated into Th1 cells (50 U mL−1 IL-2 and 10 ng mL−1 IL-12). After 24 h, the differentiated cells were washed and starved with DMEM for 3 h and then either not treated (0 min) or stimulated with 20 ng mL−1 IL18 for 5, 10, 20, 30 or 40 min prior to lysis in RIPA buffer.

Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 neutralizing antibody had no effect on Map3k2-deficient T cell-induced colitis. These data strongly argue that the augmented Th17 response is not responsible for much milder colitis phenotype in mice receivingMap3k2-deficient T cells. These data also support that Map3k2 signals play a critical role in the generation of IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells in colitis development. Although multiple cytokines, stress signals, and TLR ligands are able to activate MAP3K2 and its regulatory signals, only IL-18 was found to augment Th1 cell differentiation in a MAP3K2-dependent manner (Figure 3C). IL-18 is known to play a key role in inflammation induction and tissue repair in murine colitis models (Muñoz et al., 2015; Novick et al., 2013; Nowarski et al., 2015; Siegmund, 2010). IL-18 and its related inflammasome pathway genes have been identified as risk genes in IBD (Kaser et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown that IL-18 could stimulate innate lymphoid cells and NK cells to produce IFN-γ and IL-22 (Fantuzzi et al., 1999; Muñoz et al., 2015). Whereas we found that IL-18 could not induce intestinal IL-22 production in Map3k2−/− mice (data not shown), our present study unravels a Map3k2-dependent signal in CD4+ T cells that is essential for IL-18-mediated CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1 cells. In addition, we also examined the effect of IL-18 on Th17 differentiation in wildtype and MAP3K2 deficient CD4+ T cells, and found IL-18 similarly affected wild type and Map3k2-KO Th17 cell differentiation (Figure S4A and B in Supporting Information). Interestingly, IL-18 shares its receptor, IL-18R, with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 (Garlanda et al., 2013; Weber et al., 2010), whose signal and function might also be affected byMap3k2 deficiency, and further studying the function of IL-18R in the intestinal microenvironment might be warranted. Map3k2 is capable of mediating various upstream signals to activate multiple downstream pathways, including JNK, ERK, p38 and ERK5 (Nakamura and Johnson, 2003; Zhang et al., 2006a). However, our current study shows that upon IL-18 stimulation, only one MAPK, JNK, is involved in transducing the cytokine signal to promote Th1 cell differentiation. Currently, the precise targets downstream of MAP3K2-JNK in Th1 cell differentiation remain unclear, and further study is required to reveal how substrate specificity of JNK is determined in the colitis setting. One possibility is posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of MAP3K2, such as phosphorylation and methylation (Mazur et al., 2014), which could control its binding affinity to other proteins. Thus, the impacts of each PTM of MAP3K2, especially those localized in the PB1 domain, on MAP3K2 function require more in vivo studies. In conclusion, we reveal a crucial and specific role of Map3k2 in mediating IL-18-driven T cell responses in the development of intestinal inflammation. Our results identify a role for IL-18-mediated pathways in IBD pathogenesis and provide insight into the mechanism of action of T cell-specific IL-18 signaling. Furthermore, our results explain the cellular and molecular mechanism by which IL-18 is involved in pathological processes. Our study suggests that blockade of T cell-specific IL-18R-MAP3K2 signaling will ameliorate intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the expansion of Th1 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice Map3k2 floxed mouse lines were generated by Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc. The PCR primer sequences used for genotyping are shown in Table S1 in Supporting Information. The Cd4Cre mouse line was obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Rag2−/− mice were purchased from Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc. All mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions (SPFs) in individually ventilated cages with a regular chow diet. Unless otherwise indicated, 8–16-week-old and sexmatched mice were used in all assays. All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals as provided by Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC). T cell transfer colitis CD4+ T cells were first enriched from the spleens of mice by magnetic activated cell sorting (MASC) (STEMCELL Technologies, Canada). Then, naïve CD4+ T cell (CD4+ CD25−CD45RBhiCD44loCD62Lhi) subpopulations were sorted by flow cytometry from enriched CD4+ T cells based on the expression of CD4, CD25, CD45RB, CD44 and CD62L. Naïve CD4+ T cells were injected i.p. into Rag2−/− mice at a dose of 4×105 per mouse. Body weights were recorded every 5 days. After 4–6 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and ileum and colon tissues from mice were histologically assessed by H&E staining. Histological assessment of colitis severity was performed as previously described. CD4+ T helper cell differentiation Naïve T cells from the spleens of mice were sorted and activated with plate bound anti-CD3 antibody (2 μg mL−1; BD Bioscience, USA) and soluble anti-CD28 antibody (1 μg mL−1; BD Bioscience) in T cell medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 1x P/S, 1x nonessential amino acids and 50 μmol L−1 b-2M) and differentiated under the following conditions for 4 days: Th1 cells: anti-IL-4 antibody (10 μg mL−1; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), IL-2 (50 U mL−1; Pepro399Wu, N., et al.

When indicated, H2O2 (20 μmol L −1; Sigma, USA), TNF-α (20 ng mL−1; PeproTech), LPS (100 ng mL−1; Sigma), Pam3CSK4 (1 μg mL−1; InvivoGen, Hong Kong), TGF-β (1 ng mL−1; Cell Signaling Technology), IL-18 (20 ng mL−1; MBL International) or JNK inhibitor (50 µmol L−1; SP600125) were added to Th1 cell-differentiating conditions. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) Mice were subjected to various experimental procedures as described in the text and then sacrificed, and the ileum and colon tissue were isolated and frozen using liquid nitrogen. Naïve T cells from the spleens of mice were sorted and differentiated. The frozen tissues and differentiated cells were lysed with TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a motorized homogenizer followed by RNA extraction using a standard protocol. Total RNAwas then immediately reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT Reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa, Japan). qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa) together with a ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All qRT-PCR primers were purchased from Sangon Biotech. In vivo anti-IL17A and recombinant (r)IFN-γ administration Naïve CD4+ T cells from the spleens of Cd4-Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice were sorted as described above. Naïve CD4+ T cells were subsequently injected i.p. into Rag2−/− mice at a dose of 4×105 per mouse. Recipient mice were treated with anti-IL17A antibody (R&D Systems, MAB421) and recombinant (r)IFN-γ (R&D Systems) under the following conditions. For anti-IL-17A treatment, anti-IL-17A antibody was injected at a dose of 10 µg/mouse every 5 days. Control mice received an injection of the same amount of isotype control antibody. For rIFN-γ treatment, rIFN-γ was injected at a dose of 5,000 U per mouse every 5 days. Control mice received an injection of the same volume of PBS. Body weights were recorded every 5 days. After 4–6 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and the ileum and colon tissues of mice were histologically assessed by H&E staining. Flow cytometry analysis and FACS For cell surface staining, single-cell suspensions were stained with fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies at the recommended dilutions for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. Cells were then washed once with 1×PBS containing 2% FBS and resuspended in 1×PBS containing 2% FBS for flow cytometry or cell sorting. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated with Cell Stimulation Cocktail (plus protein transport inhibitors) for 4 h. Cells were first surface stained and then stained with antibodies against the indicated cytokines after fixation/permeabilization with a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Bioscience). For Foxp3 staining, cells were first surface stained and then stained with antibodies against Foxp3 after fixation/permeabilization with a Foxp3 staining kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-TCRβ antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific), antiCD4 antibody (BD Bioscience), anti-CD8 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-CD25 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-CD44 antibody (BD Bioscience), anti-CD62L antibody (BioLegend), anti-IFN-γ antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-IL-17A antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-IL-4 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anti-Foxp3 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For flow cytometry, stained cells were analyzed using a Fortessa X20 instrument with FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). For live cell sorting experiments, antibodystained cells were immediately sorted into RPMI 1640 containing 50% FBS using a BD FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences). Isolation of intestinal LPLs The mouse ileum and colon were surgically excised, flushed with DPBS, opened longitudinally after removal of Peyer’s patches and cut into pieces of approximately 0.5 cm in length. The intestinal tissues were then washed twice and incubated in DPBS containing 2% FBS, 1 mmol L−1 EDTA and 1 mmol L−1 DTT at 37°C with constant shaking at 200 rpm on a shaking incubator with a rotational radius of 1.5 cm for 10 min to release epithelial cells. The mucosal tissues were then washed with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and digested in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, collagenase type VIII (50 U mL−1 for colon, 30 U mL−1 for ileum; Sigma) and DNase I (50 U mL−1 for colon, 30 U mL−1 for ileum; Sigma) at 37°C for 50 min. After digestion, the remaining tissue fragments were collected into a 50 mL tube, vortexed vigorously for 30 s and passed through a 100 μm cell strainer. The resultant cell suspension was then centrifuged at 500×g and 4°C for 5 min before discarding the supernatant. LPLs were enriched using Percoll gradient centrifugation (40% to 80% Percoll). 400 Wu, N., et al.
