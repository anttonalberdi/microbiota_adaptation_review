X-box binding protein 1 spliced (XBP1s), a transcription factor, plays a key role in ameliorating insulin resistance and maintaining glucose homeostasis. Unfortunately, the short half-life of the protein Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of dampens its clinical application, and the specific site of lysine residue that could be ubiquitinated and involved in the degradation of XBP1s remains elusive. Methods and Results：Here, we identified K60 and K77 on XBP1s as two pivotal ubiquitin sites required for its proteasome-dependent degradation. We also constructed a double mutant form of XBP1s (K60/77R) and found that it showed higher capacity in resisting against ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, increasing nuclear translocation, enhancing transcriptional activity, suppressing ER stress and promoting Foxo1 degradation, compared to that of wild type XBP1s (WT). Consistently, overexpression of the K60/77R XBP1s mutant in DIO mice increased the ability to reduce ER stress and decrease Foxo1 levels, thus contributed to maintaining glucose homeostasis. Conclusion：Our results suggest that delaying the degradation of XBP1s by preventing ubiquitination might provide a strategic approach for reducing ER stress as an anti-diabetes therapy.

Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of 1. Introduction Unrelieved Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a central pathology to the development of several metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity [1-3]. ER stress activates a series of kinases, such as inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α), the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which are termed as the unfolded protein response (UPR). X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP1), a basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor of the CREB/ATF protein family, is a key master to relieve ER stress [1, 2, 4]. Under ER stress conditions, IRE1α is activated which leads to a functional XBP1 mRNA by splicing 26 nucleotides from the initial mRNA [5]. The XBP1s protein contains a C-terminal transactivation domain and functions as a stress-inducible potent transcription factor in inducing UPR target genes expression via binding to the UPR element [6-9]. Upon IRE1α activation, XBP1s translocates into the nucleus and activates its target genes encoding ER chaperones and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components, which consequently enhances the capacity of protein folding and degradation, in order to maintain ER homeostasis [10-13]. During the development of diabetes, ER stress blocks insulin signaling via activation JNK and also induces pancreatic β cell apoptosis, which aggravates diabetes progression [14]. Activated ATF6 induces Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of SREBP-1c proteolytic cleavage and subsequent lipogenic gene expression and activated PERK-ATF4 signaling up-regulates the expression of VLDL receptor, which cause aberrant lipid metabolism in liver and promotes NAFLD and NASH development[15-17]. What’s more, hypothalamic ER stress activates IKKβ/NF-κB, which interrupts central leptin signaling and leads to uncontrollably food intake and obesity [18, 19]. Several physiological conditions associated with increased protein demand lead to excessive unfolded or mis-folded proteins accumulated in ER lumen and activation of UPR signaling, which is termed as physiologic ER stress [20-22]. Re-feeding after a fasting period [1, 23] or an extended fasting can induce physiologic ER stress [24]. Under physiologic ER stress, adequate amounts of XBP1s could be up-regulated, which contributes to relieve the ER stress. Obese mice show reduced XBP1s abundance and impaired XBP1s nucleus importation in liver, which subsequently led to the development of ER stress and insulin resistance. Whereas, liver-specific overexpression of XBP1s in obese and diabetic mice restores XBP1s function in improving ER and glucose homeostasis [1, 25, 26]. Post-translational modification of XBP1s affects its abundance and activity [1, 25]. It has reported that acetylation of XBP1s increases the protein stability and enhances its transcriptional activity [27, 28], and Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of phosphorylation of XBP1s caused by p38 MAPK and IKKβ also stabilizes XBP1s [1, 25]. Endogenous XBP1s is rapidly turned over in a proteasome-dependent manner, which results in a short half-life of XBP1s [1, 25, 27]. It has been documented that PGC-1α interacts with XBP1s and promotes its degradation via 26S proteasome. In obesity, hepatic PGC-1α gene is excessively expressed, which leads to an enhanced protein degradation of XBP1s [1, 29]. It has been well documented that ubiquitination represents another key modification of XBP1s to controls its degradation [29, 30]. However, the specific ubiquitination sites of XBP1s remain largely unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the specific ubiquitination sites of XBP1s and thus access the importance of these sites in the effect of XBP1s on ER homeostasis and glucose metabolism. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study design This study aims to identify the specific sites of lysine residue that are involved in the degradation of XBP1s and explore the biological function of these sites in regulating glucose homeostasis. In in vitro cell culture, we constructed a series of mutant plasmids and identified K60 and K77 on XBP1s as two pivotal ubiquitin sites related to its proteasome-dependent degradation. In in vivo mouse models, liver specific overexpression of XBP1s (WT and K60/77R mutation) were Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of generated by tail vein injection of adenovirus (eight mice per group in db/db mice and five mice per group in DIO mice) with the approval from the Ethic Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital (Approval No: 2017-0007).

HRP conjugated second antibodies and anti-mouse Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from BioTNT (China). Cycloheximide (CHX) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Percoll was purchased from pharmacia (17089102). Rat collagen I was purchased from R&D (Catalog Number: 3440-100-01).Collagenase type I was bought from Worthington biochemical (co, #4196). 2.3.Cell Culture Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of HEK293T, HEK293A cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6J mice via collagenase perfusion. An infusion needle was catheterized into the inferior vena cava of anesthetized mice and the portal vein was cut off to enable blood flow after catheterization. The isolation procedure was conducted according to previous a study [31]. Next, dissociated primary hepatocytes were filtered with 70-μm mesh cell strainers, and purified with gradient separation by percoll. Then, we suspended hepatocytes and plated them on collagen-coated culture dish for 4 h until cells were attached. Hepatocytes were cultured in Medium 199 (Sigma), 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Plasmids were transfected into primary hepatocytes using Lipofectamine3000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM (Gibco) after attachment following manufacturer’s instructions. 2.4.Plasmid construction XBP1s mutant plasmids were constructed using pCMV5-Flag-XBP1s as the template by a KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo, Japan) following manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR reaction was performed with the following cycles: 94°C 2 minutes, then 98°C 10 seconds and 68°C 6 minutes for 6 cycles. After DpnI digestion for 1 h at 37°C and Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of self-cyclization by T4 Polynucleotide Kinase and ligation, the PCR product was transformed into Top 10 competent cells. The primer sequences used for K60R and K77R mutagenesis were listed below, other primers were listed in supplemental table 1. K60R: Forward: 5’-ggcgacagcgcctcacgcacct-3’; Reverse: 5’-tgcgcgcctggggcagccccccgct-3’. K77R: Forward: 5’-gactgaaaaacagagtagcagctcag-3’; Reverse: 5’-tcctcctcagcgccttctcctc-3’. Human WT and K60/77R mutant XBP1s adenoviral plasmid were obtained using a gateway recombination system from Invitrogen. Blunt end PCR products were produced using pCMV5-Flag-XBP1s (WT) and pCMV5-Flag-XBP1s (K60/77R) as the template. The primer pairs were as follows: Forward: 5’-CACCatggactacaaggacgac-3’; Reverse: 5’ttagacactaatcagctggggaaagagttc-3’. PCR was performed by three steps; step 1: 94°C for 2 min; step 2: (25 cycle s) 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1min, and 72°C for 2 min; and step 3： 72°C for 7 min. After that, PCR products were purified with PCR purification kit (OMEGA, D2500-02) and cloned into pENTR™/D-TOPO® vector using pENTR™ Directional TOPO ® Cloning Kits, which was recombined to pAd vector to create adenoviral vector pAd-XBP1s (WT) and pAdXBP1s （K60/77R）. We identified Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of the positive colonies by restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed all mutagenesis by sequencing. 2.5.Adenovirus Production Extracted adenovirus plasmids were digested with PacI restriction enzyme and purified using Phenol-chloroform method. Then linearized plasmids were transfected into the HEK293A cell. The culture media were changed every 2 days until cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, followed with three cycles of freeze/thaw/vortex to crack cells and allow release of intracellular viral particles. 2.6.Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) and Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT) 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice and 7-week-old male db/db mice were purchased from Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University. Mice were housed at a controlled temperature (24-26 °C) in a 12-hour light/dark cycle with free access to water and food. C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high fat diet containing 60% kcal of fat (Research Diets Inc.) for 12 weeks to develop the diet-induced obesity (DIO) model. The DIO or db/db mice were divided into 2 groups randomly (n = 5 per group for DIO mice; n=7 for Ad-XBP1s (WT) group and n=8 for Ad-XBP1s (K60/77R) group of db/db mice) and injected with the same dose of adenovirus (10 7 pfu/g body weight) expressing XBP1s protein (WT and K60/77R) through tail vein and left for 14 days (DIO) and 7 days (db/db), respectively. All of the animal experiments were approved by Shanghai Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. No adverse events were observed. A completed ARRIVE guidelines checklist is included in Checklist S1. For GTT analysis, mice were intraperitoneally injected with D-glucose (1.5 g/kg body weight) after an overnight fast. Blood glucose from tail veins were measured with a glucose meter at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following glucose injection. For ITT analysis, mice were fasted for 6 h and intraperitoneally injected with recombinant human insulin (Eli Lilly; 1 IU/kg). Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes following insulin treatment. Fasted blood insulin levels from tail vein were detected with an Elisa kit (AIS, Hongkong) following manufacturer’s instructions. 2.7.Analysis of in vivo Insulin Signaling Insulin (1 IU/kg) or PBS was injected intraperitoneally to mice following 6 h fasting. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 15 minutes after insulin injection, then livers were excised, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. 2.8.Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Protein Extraction Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were isolated by a NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit from Thermo Scientific according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed with PBS, and ice-cold CER I was added next (pre-added with protease inhibitor cocktail). Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of Lysates were vortexed and incubated for 10 min on ice, followed by CER II buffer addition (pre-added with protease inhibitor cocktail). The cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 12000 rpm, and supernatants were transferred to a new tube as the cytoplasmic fractions. The insoluble pellets were suspended in ice-cold NER buffer and incubated on ice for 40 min with intermittent vortexing for every 10 min. Then, the lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12000 rpm to obtain nuclear fraction proteins. 2.9.Western Blotting Liver tissues and cell lysates were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM TrisHCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) Sodium Deoxycholate, protease inhibitor cocktail, and PhosSTOP) for 30 minutes on ice and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was quantified with a BCA protein assay kit from Invitrogen and lysates were normalized to the same concentration. After adding 5  loading buffer, samples were then boiled at 100°C for 10 min before loading to SDS-PAGE gel. After resolving in SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) BSA dissolved in TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST; pH 7.4) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody in TBST with 5% (w/v) BSA at 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed three times in TBST before Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. The immunoblots were developed with Millipore’s chemiluminescent HRP substrate using a chemiluminescence assay system (AI600，GE). 2.10.Immunoprecipitation HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pCMV5-Flag-XBP1s plasmids (WT or K60/77R) and myc-Ub in 6 cm dish. Cells were treated with MG132 (10 μM) for 6 h before harvest and lysed with IP buffer (Beyotime) supplemented with 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma) and quantified by BCA protein assay kit. The supernatant was incubated with Flag-beads (Abmart) for 4 h at 4°C with a gentle rotation. To remove unbound material, beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to remove the supernatant. The pellet was re-suspended in 2  SDS loading buffer and boiled at 100°C for 10 min. The supernatants were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. 2.11.Fluorescent microscopy HEK293T cells were plating into 24-well dishes containing cover slips coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma). Cells at 80% were transfected with pCMV5-Flag-XBP1s (WT or K60/77R) for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) Paraformaldehyde for 15 min and blocked with Goat serum containing 0.1% Triton-X100 for 30 min. Then cells were incubated with mouse Flag antibody overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with anti-mouse fluorescent secondary antibody for 1 h in dark. The nuclei of Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of cells were stained with DAPI for 15 minutes. Cover slips were then removed from dishes and moved onto glass slides. The fluorescent pictures when captured with Zeiss two-photon microscope using a 40× oil objective. 2.12.RNA Extraction and Real-Time Quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted from cells or the liver of mice using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) following manufacturer’s instruction. The reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was performed using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd) by following conditions: 25°C for 5 min, 50°C for 30 min, and 85°C for 5 min. The gene expression was analyzed with Real-Time PCR Detection System (Roche) using SYBR Green Supermix (Vazyme Biotech Co.Ltd). Unless otherwise specified, the mRNA levels were normalized to 18S as a housekeeping gene. The primers were listed in supplemental table 1. 2.13.Statistical Analysis All data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). As for the GTT and ITT test, statistical significance was calculated by two-way ANOVA. For other analyses, statistical significance was calculated using Student’s t test. Significance was accepted at the level of P<0.05. 3. RESULTS 3.1. K60/77R mutation increases the protein stability of XBP1s Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of Since the short half-life of XBP1s dampens its therapeutic potential, we sought to identify the exact ubiquitination site of XBP1s which was involved in its degradation. Ubiquitination often occurs at the lysine residue and mutating the lysine residue into arginine could efficiently block the ubiquitination process [1]. According to previous reports [1, 23], phosphorylation at T48, S61 and S148 sites of XBP1s caused by IKKβ and p38 MAPK could efficiently suppress the proteasome-dependent XBP1s degradation, which indicates that phosphorylation on these sites might create steric-hindrance effect to block ubiquitination of lysine residue at the N-terminus of XBP1s [32]. Thus, we proposed a hypothesis that the lysine sites at the N-terminus of XBP1s might be the key sites which play the pivotal roles in XBP1s degradation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of mutant XBP1s plasmids by substituting the lysine residues (K) at the N-term with arginine residues (R) separately (Fig.1A). WT and mutant XBP1s plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells, which were then treated with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit global protein translation (s.Fig.1). Consistent with the previous report [25], WT XBP1s decreased in a time-dependent manner and became undetectable 30 minutes after CHX treatment (Fig. 1B and C, s.Fig.1C). The XBP1s K60R and K77R mutant showed a delayed degradation rate and K60/77R XBP1s double mutant was more stable than single mutant (Fig. 1B, s.Fig. 1A-D). Densitometry analyses of Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of Western blots in Figure 1C showed the K60/77R XBP1s mutant prolonged its half-life from 10 minutes to 22 minutes (P<0.05) (Fig. 1D). 3.2. K60/77R mutation enhances the nuclear localization of XBP1s and reduces ubiquitination of XBP1s To explore the mechanism by which K60/77R mutation increases exogenous XBP1s expression, we first assessed mRNA abundance mediated by exogenous overexpression. There was no significant differences in mRNA abundance between WT and K60/77R XBP1 after transfected with the equal amounts (Fig. 2A). However, XBP1s target genes such as ERDJ4, HSPA5 and HERPUD1 were significantly upregulated by K60/77R XBP1 (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A). As a transcription factor, the nuclear proportions of XBP1s can indicate activity. As demonstrated in Figure 2B and supplemental Figure 2A-B, K60/77R XBP1s showed i creased XBP1s content in both the nuclear and cytoplasm fraction compared to that of WT XBP1s, which was consistent with the result in Figure 1C. However, the ratio of nuclear abundance to cytoplasm level of XBP1s was significantly higher in cells transfected with XBP1s (K60/77R) than that in WT control (Fig. 2C), responding to the upregulation of its target genes when compared to that of WT XBP1s (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence staining showed greater nuclear XBP1s intensity for the K60/77R mutant than WT control (Fig. 2D and 2E). Taken together, these data indicate that K60/77R mutation in Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of XBP1s enhances its stability and activity.. Considering that XBP1s is degradated through a proteasome-dependent process, we next tested whether K60/77R mutation affected the abundance of ubiquitinated XBP1s. A myc-tagged ubiquitin (myc-Ub)-expressing plasmid together with WT or K60/77R-mutant XBP1s expressing plasmids were tranfected into HEK293T cells. These cells were subsequently exposed to MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor. XBP1s was then pulled down with a Flag-specific antibody and the precipitates were probed with a myc-specific antibody, to detect the ubiqutinated XBP1s. As shown in Figure 2F, K60/77R mutation in XBP1s remarkedly reduced its ubiquitin modification, without affecting global ubiquitination abundance. 3.3. K60/77R XBP1s enhances insulin sensitivity in the hepatocyte To identify the effect of XBP1s (K60/77R) on insulin signaling, we next investigated insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and downstream GSK3β phosphorylation in primary hepatocytes from C57BL/6J mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were transfected with plasmids expressing WT or K60/77R XBP1s, followed with insulin treatment. As shown in Figure 3A, insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and GSK3β phosphorylation activity were markedly elevated in the cells transfected with XBP1s (K60/77R) plasmid after insulin stimulation as compared to that of WT XBP1s group. Densitometry analysis of western blot results Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of confirmed that p-Akt/total Akt and p-GSK3β/total GSK3β ratios were significantly increased in XBP1s (K60/77R) group (p<0.01). Palmitic acid (PA) has been reported to inhibit insulin sensitivity [33], then we tested the effect of XBP1s (K60/77R) on PA-induced insulin resistance (s.Fig. 3). PA significantly reduced the insulin-induced Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation abundance in XBP1s (WT) group (Fig. 3C and D). Whereas, overexpression of mutated XBP1s (K60/77R) ameliorated PA-mediated suppression of Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation levels (Fig. 3C and D), which indicated that XBP1s (K60/77R) could reverse the effect of PA more effectively, compared to that of XBP1s (WT). It has also been reported that insulin stimulation can increase the nuclear translocation of XBP1s [34]. To test whether the K60/77R-mutant form could affect the response of XBP1s to insulin, we transfected AML12 cells with WT or K60/77R XBP1s, followed by insulin exposure for 6 or 12 minutes. As demonstrated in Figure 3E and 3F, insulin treatment resulted in 1.9-fold increase in the nuclear translocation of XBP1s (K60/77R), compared to that of XBP1s (WT) (P<0.05). These data indicated that the double mutation (K60/77R) may improve the XBP1s sensitivity to insulin. 3.4. K60/77R-mutant XBP1s is more capable of maintaining glucose homeostasis in DIO mice Given that XBP1s (K60/77R) enhances insulin sensitivity in vitro, we Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of next examined the in vivo relevance of this observation. It has been reported that XBP1s abundance was reduced in the liver of obese mice and hepatic overexpression of XBP1s in obese and diabetic mice restores XBP1s function in improving ER and glucose homeostasis [1, 25, 26]. Thus adenovirus vectors carrying WT XBP1s (Ad-WT) and K60/77R XBP1s (Ad-K60/77R) were administrated to diet-induced obese (DIO) mice through tail vein injection. Ad-K60/77R injection led to an increase in XBP1s-target genes (Erdj4, Hspa5, Herpud1 and Piad3), compared to Ad-WT injected group (P<0.05) (Fig. 4A). Although no changes in body weight were observed between the two groups (Fig. 4B), fasted blood glucose levels were lower in Ad-K60/77R injected mice on day 12 post-injection (P<0.05) (Fig. 4C). Consistently, plasma insulin levels were decreased in Ad-K60/77R group, although this was not statistically significant (Fig. 4D). Moreover, glucose tolerance tests (GTT) indicated that overexpression of K60/77R XBP1s in DIO mice significantly improved glucose metabolism homeostasis, compared to that of Ad-WT group (P<0.05) (Fig. 4E and 4F). Consistently, insulin tolerance tests (ITT) revealed that Ad-K60/77R injected mice showed better insulin sensitivity, as compared with Ad-WT group (P<0.05) (Fig. 4G and 4H). We next investigated insulin-induced phosphorylated Akt and GSKβ abundance in primary hepatocytes from DIO mice which have been injected with Ad-WT XBP1s or Ad-K60/77R XBP1s. Akt Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of phosphorylation and GSK3β phosphorylation levels increased in liver tissues of Ad-K60/77R injected mice after insulin stimulation. Densitometry analysis of western blot results confirmed that p-Akt/total Akt and p-GSK3β/total GSK3β ratios were significantly increased in Ad-K60/77R group (P<0.05) (Fig. 5B and 5C). The mRNA and protein abundance of Pepck and G6pase were substantially reduced in Ad-K60/77R group comparing with that of Ad-WT group (P<0.05) (Fig. 5D and 5E). Previous report has documented that XBP1s promotes Foxo1 degradation [26]. Ad-WT and Ad-K60/77R-injected groups have similar Foxo1 mRNA content (Fig. 5D), but K60/77R mice showed lower Foxo1 protein abundance than WT mice, indicating an increased capacity for XBP1s to promote Foxo1 degradation (Fig. 5E). 3.5. K60/77R-mutant XBP1s alleviates ER stress in DIO mice As XBP1s plays a key role in relieving ER stress, we detected the phosphorylation levels of a series of kinases activated by ER stress in the livers of DIO mice. The abundance of p-PERK and p-eIF2α were all decreased in Ad-K60/77R mice (Fig. 5F). Densitometry analysis of western blot results (Fig. 5F) confirmed that overexpression of XBP1s (K60/77R) substantially reduced the p-PERK/total PERK and p-eIF2α/total eIF2α ratios (Fig. 5G-H, and s.Fig. 4A). These results suggested a higher capacity of the K60/77R XBP1s mutant to suppress hepatic ER stress. Consistently, we found that K60/77R XBP1s Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of suppressed cellular ER stress stimulated by tunicamycin to a greater extent than WT (Fig. 5I). In addition, no differences in adipocytes morphology and adipose tissue weight between WT and K60/77R groups were observed (Fig. S4), suggesting that hepatic overexpression of XBP1s (K60/77R) within 2 weeks might not affect adipose tissue. 3.6. K60/77R-mutant XBP1s alleviates hepatic ER stress and improves glucose homeostasis in db/db mice To further examine the effect of XBP1s (K60/77R) on glucose regulation, we performed similar experiments in the db/db mice injected with Ad-XBP1s (WT) and Ad-XBP1s (K60/77R). No change of body weight was observed between the two groups (Fig. 6A). Fasted blood glucose and plasma insulin abundance were both lower in Ad-K60/77R injected mice, compared to Ad-WT group (P<0.05) (Fig. 6B-C). Consistently, GTT and ITT analysis showed that whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism were also significantly enhanced in the Ad-K60/77R group, compared to that of Ad-WT group (Fig. 6D-G). In line with this, XBP1s (K60/77R) also suppressed the mRNA levels of gluconeogenesis genes, G6pase and Pepck (Fig. 7A). We found that XBP1s protein and its target genes, Erdj4, Hspa5, Herpud1 and Piad3 were higher in Ad-K60/77R injected mice than that in Ad-WT group (Fig. 7B-7D). Consistently, the phosphorylated PERK Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of abundance were lower in Ad-K60/77R groups (Fig. 7B), indicting a reduction of ER stress. Next, we also test whether XBP1s (K60/77R) effects unspliced XBP1 with QPCR analysis. X-box binding protein 1 (XPB1u) mRNA levels and the ratios of XBP1s/XBP1u showed no difference between the two groups (Fig. 7E-F). In addition, hepatic overexpression of XBP1s (WT) or XPB1s (K60/77R) have no effects on the adipose tissue weight (Fig. 7G). The mRNA levels of general adipose markers (Ppar2 and Fabp4), fatty acid oxidation genes (Cpt1, Ppar, Mcad and Lcad) and lipolysis genes (Hsl and Atgl) showed no difference between XBP1s (K60/77R) and XPB1s (WT) groups (Fig. 7H). These results further suggested that a short-time elevation of hepatic XBP1s (K60/77R) abundance might have no effect on adipose tissue. 4. Discussion XBP1s is an important mediator in relieving ER stress and restoring homeostasis, as well as maintaining glucose homeostasis [1, 25]. Upon activation, XBP1s translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of downstream genes involved in protein folding, trafficking and degradation, which consequently contribute to relieve ER stress [8, 9, 12, 13]. In this study, we identified two key ubiquitination sites on XBP1s (K60 and K77), double mutating of which increased XBP1s stability and Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of prevented its degradation. XBP1s is rapidly turned over in a proteasome-dependent degradation process [27], and several regulators play key roles in the ubiquitination/proteasome-dependent XBP1s recycle, including E3 ligases (Fbw7 and Cullin3–SPOP) [35, 36], nuclear receptor SHP, and transcription co-factor PGC-1α [29, 36]. PGC-1α physically interacts with XBP1s and promotes protein degradation of XBP1s via the 26S proteasome pathway. In obesity, hepatic PGC-1α expression is excessively elevated, which causes an increase in XBP1s degradation and consequent unresolved ER stress [29]. Here, we constructed a stable XBP1s form, XBP1s (K60/77R) and revealed that this stable protein had an enhanced transcriptional activity, and higher capability to relieve ER stress. We also demonstrated that overexpression of K60/77R XBP1s in DIO mice was more capable to relieve hepatic ER stress and improve systemic glucose homeostasis. These results suggest a potential therapeutic strategy that overexpression of XBP1s (K60/77R) may fight against insulin resistance. Recent advances in developing clinically adeno-associated virus (AAV) have contributed substantially to the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Two rAAV gene therapy drugs, Glybera and Luxturna, have been approved by the European Medicines Agency and United States FDA respectively[37, 38]. These results also provide a possibility to develop an XBP1s-overexpression technique against diabetes in clinic in the future. Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of Post-translational modification of XBP1s affects its degradation process. For example, p38 MAPK and IKKβ both phosphorylate XBP1s and enhance its stability [1, 25]. The phosphorylation sites on XBP1s targeted by p38 MAPK and IKKβ are T48, S61 and S148, which are all at the N-terminus of XBP1s [1, 25]. In this study, we found the two ubiquitin sites (K60 and K77) at the N-terminus of XBP1s, which are near to the targeted sites of p38 MAPK and IKKβ. Taken together, these results strengthen our earlier hypothesis that the phosphorylation on T48, S61 and S148 might generate a steric-hindrance effect to block ubiquitination of lysine residues at the N-terminus of XBP1s. Similar to XBP1s, XPB1u is also degraded by ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms [39]. Interestingly, in addition to being substrate targets for their E3 ubiquitin ligases, XBP1s and XBP1u can feedback regulate the E3 ubiquitin ligases. XBP1s down-regulates Fbw7 expression through the NF-κB and E2F1 pathways [36]. It is also reported that XPB1u binds and stabilizes the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, by inhibiting its self-ubiquitination, and consequently enhances tumorigenesis, indicating that XBP1u has other functions besides being a precursor of XBP1s [40]. In addition to its role as a transcription factor, XBP1s can directly interact with other metabolism mediators to maintain glucose homeostasis [26]. Under insulin stimulation, the regulatory subunits p85 dissociate from the PI3K heterodimer and bind with XBP1s to mediate the nuclear Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of import of XBP1s [23]. It is also documented that XBP1s interacts with Foxo1 and promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of Foxo1, thus decreasing the expression of downstream target genes Pepck and G6pase, ultimately reducing gluconeogenesis [26]. Here, we have revealed that K60/77R mutation in XBP1s increased the ability of XBP1s to decrease Foxo1 abundance. Perhaps the K60/77R mutant may enhance the interaction between XBP1s and other proteins, thus having an effect in metabolic regulation. In our study, no change in body weight was observed between the Ad-XBP1s (WT or K60/77R) injected mice. These may be due to that all in vivo experiments we did were finished within 3 weeks after adenovirus injection，and there is no enough time for adenovirus-mediated hepatic specific XBP1s overexpression to affect central nervous system (CNS), other peripheral tissues and appetite. In fact, similar observations were found by other groups. Zhang et.al found that Ad-XBP1s injection to db/db mice did not change the body weight within 4 weeks[41]. There are still some further studies that can be carried out beyond the scope of our study. One possible further study is to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase which ubiquitinates K60 and K77 on XBP1s. In addition, as ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation all regulate XBP1s’ stability, the cross-talk between these post-translational modifications highlight a complicated link between these modifications which require Journal Pre-proof Jo ur na l P re -p ro of further investigation [32, 42]. Overall, our results have identified a stable mutant form of XBP1s with an increased capacity to reduce hepatic ER stress and ameliorates insulin resistance by both in intro and in vivo experiments. Regulating the stability of XBP1s by introducing ubiquitination-resistant mutations or preventing XBP1s degradation by other means may present a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
