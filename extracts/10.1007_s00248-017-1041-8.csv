"1","wild","One complicating factor in many of these studies is that differing host species often have different diets and environments—either in captivity or in the wild—making it challenging to separate out the effects of phylogeny from diet. "
"2","wild","In the wild, colobines consume a variety of plants daily and seasonally. "
"3","wild","As available, age, sex, grouping, and wild/captive born status were recorded (Table S2). "
"4","wild","Interestingly, Pygathrix and Nasalis are the most closely related genera phylogenetically and in the wild, Colobus, Trachypithecus, and Rhinopithecus, all tend to consume higher proportions of leaves—and particularly mature leaves—than Nasalis and Pygathrix (Table 3). "
"5","wild","^ Higher fiber consumption [69], and notably in wild colobine monkeys as compared captive colobine monkeys [30, 31], has been linked with increased microbial diversity in multiple recent studies. "
"6","wild","Microbes within the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families have been reported in wild folivorous primates, and one study by Amato et al. [77] suggests that the changing abundances of these microbes seasonally are linked to increases and decreases in dietary energy consumption. "
"7","wild","Future work comparing the gut microbial communities of wild and captive colobines as well as healthy and unhealthy colobines is needed to further assess the potential role of the gut microbiota and the core taxa in colobine health. "
"8","wild","Another example of the interplay between diet and phylogeny comes from a controlled study on rodents: two closely related species of woodrats were captured from the wild and brought into captivity [51]. "
"9","wild","After 6 months, both species still had distinct gut microbial communities, and both retained over 50% of the OTUs they had as wild rodents [51]. "
"10","wild","In other words, ~50% of their gut microbiota was altered by captivity and a Table 3 Proportion of leaves consumed in wild diets of several colobine genera Genera Proportion leaves in wild diet Proportion mature leaves in wild diet References Rhinopithecus 93% 82% (varies seasonally, can be as low as 0.6%) [54–57] Trachypithecus 60% 40% [17, 58] Colobus 81% 13% [17, 59, 60] Pygathrix 82% 9% [61–64] Nasalis 73% (some reports indicate <50%) 3% [17, 58, 65] 524 Hale V. "
"11","wild","The other ~50% was unaffected by the new environment and retained a likeness to their wild conspecifics, potentially due to host phylogeny or host genetics. "

"
"16","adaptation","The gut microbiota can enable adaptation to new dietary niches [1]; thus, the effects of diet and host phylogeny are often intertwined, as dietary changes—which are mediated through gut microbes—can play a role in host speciation [9]. "
"17","adaptation","It has been suggested that these adaptations allowed colobines to shift their diet gradually from frugivory to folivory, reducing their competition with apes [17]. "
