"1","wild","Plasticity is well known for gut microbiota but is poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. "
"2","wild","Symbiotic community changes (i.e., plasticity) of hosts in relation to environmental changes are well known for gut microbiota [21, 22] but are poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. "
"3","wild","The fieldwork was performed during the breeding seasons 2010–2011 in a wild population located in the Hoya de Guadix (37°18′ N, 38°11′ W), southern Spain, where hoopoes breed in crops, forests, and gullies within nest boxes placed in trees or buildings. "
"4","wild","In 2011, hoopoes were also sampled in a captive population descendant from our wild population and breeding in captivity since 2008. "
"5","wild","Nest boxes in the wild were visited twice per week, from mid-February to the end of July to record laying date, clutch size, and hatching date. "
"6","wild","Cross-fostering experiments were performed between wild nests in 2010 and in 2011 between one nest in captivity and the other in wild conditions. "
"7","wild","When this was not possible, experimental nestlings were exchanged between two captivity nests, or between two wild nests. "
"8","wild","However, final sample sizes were reduced due to predation of wild nests or failures with ARISA. "
"9","fitness","On the one hand, fitness of vertically transmitted symbionts is * Juan José Soler jsoler@eeza.csic.es 1 Estación Experimental de Zonas Áridas (CSIC), E-04120 Almería, Spain 2 Departamento de Zoología Universidad de Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain 3 Departamento de Microbiología Universidad de Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain Microb Ecol (2016) 72:252–261 DOI 10.1007/s00248-016-0765-1 closely related to that of their hosts and, thus, enhancing reproductive success of hosts will directly benefit their own performance [14–17].

"12","model","Although the vast majority of symbioses described in eukaryotes involve bacteria [1, 4], studies on mechanisms of bacterial transmission are limited to a handful of model systems [5, 6]. "
"13","model","For some other model systems, microbial symbionts are acquired both vertically and horizontally, as it is the case for beneficial gastrointestinal microbiomes of animals [12] or for enterococci of the uropygial gland of hoopoes (Upupa epops) [13]. "
"14","model","Cross-fostering experiments are a well-established approach for partitioning phenotypic variance in its genetic and environmental components in mixed statistical models that include the identity of nest of origin and rearing (nested within nest of origin) as random factors [34]. "
"15","model","The similarity values were used as the dependent variables of PERMANOVA model using type III estimation of mean squares. "
"16","model","This model try to explain similarity among nestlings including two random factors: nest of origin and nest of rearing (nested within nest of origin). "
"17","model","For this model, we used only the 28 nests for which we have information for moved and non-moved nestlings from the same nest of origin. "
"18","model","The total variance explained is also shown (captured by the three axes = 33.1 %) Table 1 Results of a PERMANOVA model explaining matrices of similarity among the bacterial communities found in the uropygial secretions of hoopoe nestlings. "
"19","model","The model includes identity of nest of origin (genetic factor) and rearing (environmental factor) nested within nest of origin. "
