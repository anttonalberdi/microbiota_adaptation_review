"1","wild","Plasticity is well known for gut microbiota but is poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. "
"2","wild","Symbiotic community changes (i.e., plasticity) of hosts in relation to environmental changes are well known for gut microbiota [21, 22] but are poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. "
"3","wild","The fieldwork was performed during the breeding seasons 2010–2011 in a wild population located in the Hoya de Guadix (37°18′ N, 38°11′ W), southern Spain, where hoopoes breed in crops, forests, and gullies within nest boxes placed in trees or buildings. "
"4","wild","In 2011, hoopoes were also sampled in a captive population descendant from our wild population and breeding in captivity since 2008. "
"5","wild","Nest boxes in the wild were visited twice per week, from mid-February to the end of July to record laying date, clutch size, and hatching date. "
"6","wild","Cross-fostering experiments were performed between wild nests in 2010 and in 2011 between one nest in captivity and the other in wild conditions. "
"7","wild","When this was not possible, experimental nestlings were exchanged between two captivity nests, or between two wild nests. "
"8","wild","However, final sample sizes were reduced due to predation of wild nests or failures with ARISA. "
"9","fitness","On the one hand, fitness of vertically transmitted symbionts is * Juan José Soler jsoler@eeza.csic.es 1 Estación Experimental de Zonas Áridas (CSIC), E-04120 Almería, Spain 2 Departamento de Zoología Universidad de Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain 3 Departamento de Microbiología Universidad de Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain Microb Ecol (2016) 72:252–261 DOI 10.1007/s00248-016-0765-1 closely related to that of their hosts and, thus, enhancing reproductive success of hosts will directly benefit their own performance [14–17].
