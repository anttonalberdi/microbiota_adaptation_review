"1","wild","Plasticity is well known for gut microbiota but is poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. "
"2","wild","Symbiotic community changes (i.e., plasticity) of hosts in relation to environmental changes are well known for gut microbiota [21, 22] but are poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. "
"3","wild","The fieldwork was performed during the breeding seasons 2010–2011 in a wild population located in the Hoya de Guadix (37°18′ N, 38°11′ W), southern Spain, where hoopoes breed in crops, forests, and gullies within nest boxes placed in trees or buildings. "
"4","wild","In 2011, hoopoes were also sampled in a captive population descendant from our wild population and breeding in captivity since 2008. "
"5","wild","Nest boxes in the wild were visited twice per week, from mid-February to the end of July to record laying date, clutch size, and hatching date. "
"6","wild","Cross-fostering experiments were performed between wild nests in 2010 and in 2011 between one nest in captivity and the other in wild conditions. "
"7","wild","When this was not possible, experimental nestlings were exchanged between two captivity nests, or between two wild nests. "
"8","wild","However, final sample sizes were reduced due to predation of wild nests or failures with ARISA. "

"12","model","Although the vast majority of symbioses described in eukaryotes involve bacteria [1, 4], studies on mechanisms of bacterial transmission are limited to a handful of model systems [5, 6]. "
"13","model","For some other model systems, microbial symbionts are acquired both vertically and horizontally, as it is the case for beneficial gastrointestinal microbiomes of animals [12] or for enterococci of the uropygial gland of hoopoes (Upupa epops) [13]. "
"14","model","Cross-fostering experiments are a well-established approach for partitioning phenotypic variance in its genetic and environmental components in mixed statistical models that include the identity of nest of origin and rearing (nested within nest of origin) as random factors [34]. "
"15","model","The similarity values were used as the dependent variables of PERMANOVA model using type III estimation of mean squares. "
"16","model","This model try to explain similarity among nestlings including two random factors: nest of origin and nest of rearing (nested within nest of origin). "
"17","model","For this model, we used only the 28 nests for which we have information for moved and non-moved nestlings from the same nest of origin. "

"21","environment","A mix of vertical and horizontal transmission may be advantageous for hosts by allowing plastic changes of microbial communities depending on environmental conditions. "
"22","environment","We here explore the importance of environmental conditions experienced by nestling hoopoes (Upupa epops) during the late nesting phase determining microbiota in their uropygial gland. "
"23","environment","In cross-fostering experiments of 8 days old nestlings, “sibling-sibling” and “mother-offspring” comparisons were used to explore whether the bacterial community naturally established in the uropygial gland of nestlings could change depending on experimental environmental conditions (i.e., new nest environment). "
"24","environment","We also detected a significant effect of nest of rearing, suggesting that nestling hoopoes acquire most bacterial symbionts during the first days of life but that the microbiome is dynamic and can be modified along the nestling period depending on environmental conditions. "
"25","environment","Estimated effects of nest of rearing, but also most of those of nest of origin are associated to environmental characteristics of nests, which are extended phenotypes of parents. "
"26","environment","Thus, natural selection may favor the acquisition of appropriated microbial symbionts for particular environmental conditions found in nests. "
"27","environment","Vertical transmission Introduction Hosts may acquire symbionts directly by vertical transmission from parents to offspring [1, 2], or by horizontal transmission from the environment [3]. "
"28","environment","On the other hand, different symbionts may provide hosts with characteristics that are more appropriate for particular environments and/or symbiont effectiveness may vary with environmental conditions. "
"29","environment","Although vertical transmission is identified as a key route to host specialization on effective symbionts [14, 18], hosts with horizontally transmitted symbionts have the opportunity to adjust the community of symbionts to environmental characteristics [19]. "
"30","environment","In situations of variable environmental conditions with unpredictable selection pressures, a mix of vertical and horizontal transmission shaping symbiont bacterial communities might be of selective advantage for hosts because it would guarantee the simultaneous presence of potential beneficial microorganisms from different environments [5, 14, 20]. "
"31","environment","In this mixed mode of symbiont acquisition, the symbiotic community that hosts acquires from mothers and/or environment during the first days of life could change in relation to variable environmental conditions experienced later, in subsequent phases of life. "
"32","environment","Symbiotic community changes (i.e., plasticity) of hosts in relation to environmental changes are well known for gut microbiota [21, 22] but are poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. "
"33","environment","We experimentally explore whether microbiome of the uropygial gland of nestling hoopoes change along the nesting period in relation to environmental conditions hosted in their uropygial gland. "
"34","environment","Interestingly, we also know that antibiotic producing enterococci are transmitted from mother hoopoes to offspring soon after hatching (vertical transmission), and that hatchlings (i.e., before uropygial gland functions) are able to incorporate new enterococci symbionts from new environments after cross-fostering experiments (horizontal transmission) [13]. "
"35","environment","The question that we try to answer here is whether the bacterial community, once it is established in the uropygial gland of nestlings (i.e., functioning), could change depending on experimental environmental conditions (i.e., new nest environment). "
"36","environment","The relative contribution of factors acting during early (i.e., genetic plus early environment including any premanipulation maternal effects) and late (experimental nest environment) nesting phase were determined by (i) comparing the proportion of variance explained by nest of origin and nest of rearing, respectively. "
"37","environment","Relative contribution of early and later environments explaining microbiota of the uropygial secretion was also explored by comparing (ii) levels of similarity between siblings reared in different nests and between stepsiblings reared in the same nest, and (iii) between crossfostered nestlings and biological and stepmothers. "
"38","environment","For binning DNA fragment lengths from different samples, we used available scripts in R-environment [http://cran.rproject.org/] at www.ecology-research.com [32] with a window size of 4 base pairs (bp) and a distance of two consecutive binning frames (i.e., shift) of 0.1. "
"39","environment","Cross-fostering experiments are a well-established approach for partitioning phenotypic variance in its genetic and environmental components in mixed statistical models that include the identity of nest of origin and rearing (nested within nest of origin) as random factors [34]. "
"40","environment","This experimental approach has been previously used to explore genetic and environmental influences determining cloacal bacterial assemblages in great tit (Parus major) [35] and the enterococci community of the uropigial gland of hoopoes [13]. "
"41","environment","The effects of early nestling phase, which include genetic component and any pre-manipulation maternal and environmental effects, were estimated by the proportion of variance of microbiome composition explained by nest of origin and by mother-offspring (i.e., vertical transmission) and sibling-sibling comparisons. "
"42","environment","The effects of late nesting phase, which would only include environmental components, were estimated by the proportion of variance associated to the nest of rearing and by stepmother-offspring and sibling-stepsibling comparisons. "
"43","environment","Finally, for the 21 experiments with all the information (see above), we estimated mean values of similarities among bacterial communities of experimental nestlings and those of their genetic (reared in different nests but genetically related) or foster (reared in the same environment but genetically unrelated) siblings. "
"44","environment","This result suggests that the influence of the early nesting phase (i.e., genetic factors and/or pre-manipulation maternal and environmental effects) explaining uropygial microbiome of hoopoes was relatively larger than that of late nesting period (i.e., environmental influence and maternal effects after the experiment). "
"45","environment","Importantly, we found statistically significant effects of nest of rearing explaining bacterial community of nestling hoopoes (Table 1), which suggest that environmental conditions experienced by hoopoes during the late nesting phase also contribute to mold microbial community. "
"46","environment","We also detected a significant effect of nest of rearing, suggesting that environmental characteristics experienced after experimental treatment contributes to Fig. "
"47","environment","Results from previous cross-fostering experiments performed by Ruiz-Rodríguez et al. [13] with recently hatched nestlings that were exchanged before they started to produce secretion (4 days old) strongly suggested that enterococci from the new environment are incorporated into the community of the uropygial secretion of nestlings, although some strains came from the uropygial secretion of mothers [13]. "
"48","environment","Thus, the effect of nest of origin detected here also included environmental effects before the experiment and, accordingly, was stronger than that detected for enterococci community in cross-fostering experiments performed with 4-day-old nestlings. "
"49","environment","Consequently, results from these two experiments considered together suggest that nestling hoopoes acquire most bacterial symbionts during the first days of life, but that the microbiome of hoopoes is dynamic and can be modified along the nestling period depending on environmental conditions. "
"50","environment","The model includes identity of nest of origin (genetic factor) and rearing (environmental factor) nested within nest of origin. "
"51","environment","Bacteria from the environment that were compatible with characteristics of the uropygial gland and secretion of hoopoes would colonize hosts. "
"52","environment","Within the uropygial gland, competitive ability of different bacterial strains would depend on the particular environment (i.e., chemicals, resources, etc.) provided by hoopoes, which would determine the stabilized microbiome of the uropygial secretion [see 19]. "
"53","environment","Even if this was the explanation of the large detected microbiome similarities among relatives, the detected effects of nest of rearing suggest a plastic microbiome response to environmental changes after reaching certain stability level (i.e., uropygial gland functioning). "
"54","environment","Estimated effects of nest of rearing, but also most of those of nest of origin are likely associated to environmental characteristics of nests (included bacterial communities and characteristics of mothers). "
"55","environment","Thus, independently of the relative importance of genetic, environmental, and maternal effects, the factors determining the bacterial community of the uropygial secretion of nestling hoopoes have a considerable genetic background to be modulated by natural selection. "
"56","environment","Here, not only we found a strong effect of nest of origin that likely included indirect genetic effects but also evidence of an influence of the environment. "
