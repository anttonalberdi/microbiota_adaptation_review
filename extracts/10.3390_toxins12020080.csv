"1","wild","However, the composition of the natural S. aureus population in wild and laboratory rats is largely unknown. "
"2","wild","Here, 144 nasal S. aureus isolates from free-living wild rats, captive wild rats and laboratory rats were genotyped and profiled for antibiotic resistances and human-specific virulence genes. "
"3","wild","The nasal S. aureus carriage rate was higher among wild rats (23.4%) than laboratory rats (12.3%). "
"4","wild","Free-living wild rats were primarily colonized with isolates of clonal complex (CC) 49 and CC130 and maintained these strains even in husbandry. "
"5","wild","Five captive wild rats were colonized with CC398-MRSA. "
"6","wild","Moreover, a single CC30-MRSA and two CC130-MRSA were detected in free-living or captive wild rats. "
"7","wild","Taken together, our study revealed a natural S. aureus population in wild rats, as well as a colonization pressure on wild and laboratory rats by exposure to livestockand human-associated S. aureus, respectively. "
"8","wild","Besides humans, S. aureus is also able to colonize and infect numerous other species, including companion animals, livestock as well as wild animals [9–13]. "
"9","wild","For instance, wild rats caught on farms were carrying typical livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA strains (e.g., clonal complex (CC) 398 and sequence type (ST) 97) [18,21], while urban rats carried the same MRSA lineages prevalent in the respective local human or animal population (e.g., USA300-ST8) [19]. "
"10","wild","While investigating the epidemiology of S. aureus in both wild and laboratory mice in previous studies, we have found distinct clonal lineages and hints for host adaptation [11,34,42]. "
"11","wild","This was achieved by collecting S. aureus strains from free-living and captive wild rats, as well as laboratory rats, followed by determining the population structure and antibiotic resistance profiles of these S. aureus isolates. "
"12","wild","Laboratory Rats and Wild Rats Are Colonized with S. aureus This study aimed at determining the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus, including MRSA, in free-living and captive wild rats, as well as laboratory rats. "
"13","wild","Therefore, 145 free-living wild rats captured between 2009 and 2017 in three German federal states as well as in the Czech Republic were analyzed for S. aureus nasal carriage (Tables S1 and S2). "
"14","wild","In addition, a total of 188 captive wild rats originating from three German federal states and held in laboratory housing or large enclosures for several years were investigated for S. aureus nasal carriage (Tables S3 and S4). "
"15","wild","Overall, the S. aureus carriage rate was similar among free-living wild rats (37/145; 25.5%) and captive wild rats (41/188; 21.8%), but lower among laboratory rats (14/114; 12.3%) (Table 1). "
"16","wild","In free-living wild rats, the highest prevalence was seen in the Moravian-Silesian Region (MSR, 62.1%), followed by the German states Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (MV, 22.2%), and then North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW, 17.3%) (Table 1 and Table S6). "
"17","wild","This divergence was even more pronounced among captive wild rats, where breeding procedures and hygiene measures can promote or prevent the spread of S. aureus, respectively. "
"18","wild","For instance, S. aureus prevalence was very high (77.1%) in captive Toxins 2020, 12, 80 4 of 22 wild rats in Berlin (BE) (Table 1, Tables S4 and S7). "
"19","wild","In contrast, one wild rat population caught at a farm and afterwards held in husbandry in NRW was completely S. aureus-free. "

"155","human","Introduction Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major opportunistic pathogen in human medicine and it is increasingly recognized as a zoonotic pathogen. "
"156","human","The nasal cavity of approximately 20% of adult humans is persistently and asymptomatically colonized with S. aureus [1–3]. "
"157","human","Besides humans, S. aureus is also able to colonize and infect numerous other species, including companion animals, livestock as well as wild animals [9–13]. "
"158","human","For instance, wild rats caught on farms were carrying typical livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA strains (e.g., clonal complex (CC) 398 and sequence type (ST) 97) [18,21], while urban rats carried the same MRSA lineages prevalent in the respective local human or animal population (e.g., USA300-ST8) [19]. "
"159","human","In view of the emerging zoonotic potential of certain S. aureus lineages [22–24], an effective “One Health” strategy against the spread of S. aureus and especially MRSA has to take these bidirectional transmissions between animals and humans into account [25,26]. "
"160","human","Prominent examples include: (i) lack of antibiotic resistance genes and the highly human-specific immune evasion gene cluster (IEC) in animal isolates; (ii) lack of superantigen genes in murine S. aureus isolates; (iii) acquisition of variants of the von Willebrand factor-binding protein in ruminant and equine strains, carried by highly mobile pathogenicity islands (SaPIs); as well as (iv) a single nucleotide mutation in the dltB gene, a gene involved in lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis, which enabled a human strain to infect rabbits [10,11,31–34]. "
"161","human","S. aureus lineages commonly found in humans were not detected in these animals. "
"162","human","Many of those are common in the human population, e.g., CC1, CC5, CC7, CC8, CC15, and CC20 [44]. "
"163","human","Penicillin Resistance Was Low in Wild Rats but High in Rats with Livestock Contact We have previously reported that murine S. aureus isolates show a lower prevalence of penicillin resistance than human strains [34]. "

"
"166","human","To test whether S. aureus isolates from rats show similar features of host adaptation, we compared the presence of IEC genes and the SAg gene repertoire with CC-matched human isolates. "
"167","human","Sa3int phages harbor the human-specific IEC encoding staphylokinase (SAK), staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN), chemotaxis inhibitory protein of S. aureus (CHIPS) as well as staphylococcal enterotoxins A or P (SEA, SEP) [46,47]. "
"168","human","IEC-encoding prophages are prevalent in human S. aureus isolates, but frequently absent in animal-adapted strains, including murine and vole S. aureus isolates [11,34,44]. "
"169","human","A CC-wise comparison of the most prevalent rat S. aureus lineages with matched human strains revealed that IEC genes were significantly less frequent or even absent in the rat-derived CC8, CC49, CC88, and CC398 isolates (Table 3). "

"186","human","Usually, these isolates show an MSSA phenotype, but MRSA (both mecA and mecC positive) were also found in pigs, horses, and humans [54–56]. "
"187","human","Laboratory Rats Carry Various Lineages, Mostly of Human Origin Laboratory rats carried a high diversity of S. aureus lineages—many of which are commonly found in humans, e.g., CC1, CC5, CC8, CC15 and CC101 [44]. "
"188","human","Considering the close contact of laboratory rats with humans over many decades, it is only reasonable to assume that these strains have originally been transmitted from humans to rats. "
"189","human","This might be supported by the fact that there is a significant overlap with the S. aureus population in laboratory mice [34], implying that humans could be the Toxins 2020, 12, 80 11 of 22 prime source of new S. aureus strains in laboratory animals. "
"190","human","Transmission of S. aureus from humans to animals has been described several times [62]. "
"191","human","However, it seems likely that not all human-adapted lineages are able to colonize rats. "
"192","human","For instance, the most common human lineages (CC30 and CC45) are almost completely absent in the rat population and have also only rarely been detected in laboratory mice [34,44]. "
"193","human","On the other hand, colonizing lineages such as CC88 and CC188 have already been described in other rodents and are rarely found in humans, suggesting that they might represent rodent-specific lineages [11,34]. "
"194","human","They might have originated from the human population and introduced into the rat colony by animal caretakers, with subsequent adaptation to their new rodent host over time. "
"195","human","In addition, the captive wild rats are of interest, because they allow some conclusions about the stability of the S. aureus population after adaptation to a new environment with no further contact with wildlife, but increased contact with humans. "
"196","human","The S. aureus-positive cohorts of captive wild rats (located in BB, and BE) were still colonized with S. aureus lineages common in wild rats (CC49, CC130) and livestock (CC398), while typical human S. aureus lineages, which were common in laboratory rats (see above), were not detected, even though they included animals crossed with laboratory rats (Table S5). "
"197","human","The absence of typical human S. aureus lineages suggests that several factors, including the existing microbiome [64–66], the limited contact of caretakers to animals, as well as high hygienic standards (including wearing coats and gloves) successfully prevent the introduction of human-adapted S. aureus strains. "
"198","human","Moreover, the rat-adapted S. aureus population may be able to outcompete introduced human-adapted S. aureus strains. "
"199","human","S. aureus Isolates from Rats Likely Adapt to Their Host by Eliminating MGEs Carrying Human-Specific Virulence Factors A comparison of rat and CC-matched human S. aureus isolates showed that the rat strains are probably adapted to their host on both genetic and phenotypic levels. "
"200","human","For example, both CHIPS and SCIN efficiently block complement activation in humans but show no activity in mice and rats [67,70]. "
"201","human","S. aureus SAgs activate human T cells in the picomolar concentration range in vitro but show a 100–1000-fold reduced activity on rat T cells and a 10–100-fold reduced activity on murine T cells [69,75,76]. "
"202","human","Therefore, we compared the pro-coagulatory activity of CC49 and CC88 isolates from rats with their matched human counterparts. "
"203","human","Rat CC49 isolates coagulated rat plasma faster than matched human CC49 isolates. "
"204","human","In line with our data, Viana et al. reported that ruminant-derived strains, but not human isolates, had the capacity to stimulate clotting of ruminant plasma due to a unique MGE-encoded paralogue of the von Willebrand factor binding protein [33]. "
"205","human","Rats Carrying Human-Derived or LA-MRSA Present a Human Health Risk Considering the growing public health relevance of LA-MRSA, i.e., CC398-MRSA, in human health and livestock farming [13,77,78], there is an urgent need to elucidate potential transmission routes. "
"206","human","Rats actively explore a number of different habitats, and therefore have a unique opportunity to encounter a variety of human and livestock pathogens [16,81–83]. "
"207","human","Besides farm animals, rats might also transfer livestock-derived S. aureus from farms to domestic animals or pets, and ultimately to humans through contact with these animals or their excrements. "
"208","human","Similarly, Himsworth et al. reported an MRSA-colonization rate of 3.5% among tested urban rats, mostly involving human MRSA common in that area, such as USA300, but also CC398-MRSA [19]. "
"209","human","While the risk of rat-to-human MRSA transmission outside the farm setting is very low, it could become relevant in impoverished, inner-city neighborhoods, where socio-economic factors might promote rat infestations and hence rat-to-human contact [19,81,86]. "
"210","human","Toxins 2020, 12, 80 13 of 22 The observed elimination of human-specific virulence genes, i.e., IEC-carried immune evasion genes as well as SAg genes, in rat-derived S. aureus isolates raises the question, whether they are capable of colonizing and infecting humans. "
"211","human","We propose that the potential to colonize and/or infect humans depends on a lineage-specific repertoire of host-specific or broadly-reactive adhesins, immune evasion as well as virulence factors. "
"212","human","On the one hand, human colonization and infection with CC49 has only rarely been reported [44,56,87], suggesting a reduced fitness and virulence of these strains in humans. "
"213","human","The factors driving the spread of this zoonotic lineage in the human population are not understood yet. "
"214","human","Interestingly, the livestock-associated CC398 originated from a human CC398-MSSA. "
"215","human","Conversely, one could assume that a re-acquisition of these phages promotes the spread of zoonotic CC398-MRSA in the human population. "
"216","human","However, a recent study demonstrated that the acquisition of IEC-encoding Sa3int phages is no major driver for the re-adaptation of CC398-MRSA to the human host [89]. "
"217","human","Conclusions S. aureus, particularly MRSA, has a major impact not only on human health, but also on farm and companion animals as well as wildlife. "
"218","human","Rats are key players in the ecology of MRSA on farms and may also transmit human MRSA. "
"219","human","However, contact with humans or livestock poses a colonization pressure on rats, reflected in the uptake and long-term carriage of S. aureus isolates of human or livestock origin. "
"220","human","Laboratory rats represent a special case, because they lack the lineages CC49 and CC130 and instead carry lineages that are likely human-derived. "

"298","laboratory","The detection of a LA-S. aureus lineage in captive wild rat populations years to decades after acquisition of the ancestral animals suggests a stable colonization of rats and an effective transmission to their offspring, similar to what has been observed in laboratory mice [45]. "
"299","laboratory","Considering the close contact of laboratory rats with humans over many decades, it is only reasonable to assume that these strains have originally been transmitted from humans to rats. "
"300","laboratory","This might be supported by the fact that there is a significant overlap with the S. aureus population in laboratory mice [34], implying that humans could be the Toxins 2020, 12, 80 11 of 22 prime source of new S. aureus strains in laboratory animals. "
"301","laboratory","For instance, the most common human lineages (CC30 and CC45) are almost completely absent in the rat population and have also only rarely been detected in laboratory mice [34,44]. "
"302","laboratory","This finding is supported by similar observations in laboratory mice [45]. "
"303","laboratory","The S. aureus-positive cohorts of captive wild rats (located in BB, and BE) were still colonized with S. aureus lineages common in wild rats (CC49, CC130) and livestock (CC398), while typical human S. aureus lineages, which were common in laboratory rats (see above), were not detected, even though they included animals crossed with laboratory rats (Table S5). "
"304","laboratory","Indeed, we have previously observed that the S. aureus population in laboratory mice is stable over years, and that these bacteria are very effectively transmitted to their offspring [45]. "
"305","laboratory","In line with this, we have previously observed that this prophage is rare in S. aureus populations from laboratory Toxins 2020, 12, 80 12 of 22 and wild mice [11,34,45]. "
"306","laboratory","This confirms previous observations in wild and laboratory mice, where S. aureus isolates also lacked MGE-carried SAg genes. "
"307","laboratory","Study Design and Ethics Statements The subjects of the study were 447 rats (Rattus norvegicus, N = 381; Rattus rattus, N = 66), mostly from Germany (N = 418), but also from Czech Republic (N = 29), which were either free-living wild rats (N = 145), captive wild rats (N = 188) or laboratory rats (N = 114).
