"1","wild","However, the composition of the natural S. aureus population in wild and laboratory rats is largely unknown. "
"2","wild","Here, 144 nasal S. aureus isolates from free-living wild rats, captive wild rats and laboratory rats were genotyped and profiled for antibiotic resistances and human-specific virulence genes. "
"3","wild","The nasal S. aureus carriage rate was higher among wild rats (23.4%) than laboratory rats (12.3%). "
"4","wild","Free-living wild rats were primarily colonized with isolates of clonal complex (CC) 49 and CC130 and maintained these strains even in husbandry. "
"5","wild","Five captive wild rats were colonized with CC398-MRSA. "
"6","wild","Moreover, a single CC30-MRSA and two CC130-MRSA were detected in free-living or captive wild rats. "
"7","wild","Taken together, our study revealed a natural S. aureus population in wild rats, as well as a colonization pressure on wild and laboratory rats by exposure to livestockand human-associated S. aureus, respectively. "
"8","wild","Besides humans, S. aureus is also able to colonize and infect numerous other species, including companion animals, livestock as well as wild animals [9–13]. "
"9","wild","For instance, wild rats caught on farms were carrying typical livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA strains (e.g., clonal complex (CC) 398 and sequence type (ST) 97) [18,21], while urban rats carried the same MRSA lineages prevalent in the respective local human or animal population (e.g., USA300-ST8) [19]. "
"10","wild","While investigating the epidemiology of S. aureus in both wild and laboratory mice in previous studies, we have found distinct clonal lineages and hints for host adaptation [11,34,42]. "
"11","wild","This was achieved by collecting S. aureus strains from free-living and captive wild rats, as well as laboratory rats, followed by determining the population structure and antibiotic resistance profiles of these S. aureus isolates. "
"12","wild","Laboratory Rats and Wild Rats Are Colonized with S. aureus This study aimed at determining the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus, including MRSA, in free-living and captive wild rats, as well as laboratory rats. "
"13","wild","Therefore, 145 free-living wild rats captured between 2009 and 2017 in three German federal states as well as in the Czech Republic were analyzed for S. aureus nasal carriage (Tables S1 and S2). "
"14","wild","In addition, a total of 188 captive wild rats originating from three German federal states and held in laboratory housing or large enclosures for several years were investigated for S. aureus nasal carriage (Tables S3 and S4). "
"15","wild","Overall, the S. aureus carriage rate was similar among free-living wild rats (37/145; 25.5%) and captive wild rats (41/188; 21.8%), but lower among laboratory rats (14/114; 12.3%) (Table 1). "
"16","wild","In free-living wild rats, the highest prevalence was seen in the Moravian-Silesian Region (MSR, 62.1%), followed by the German states Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (MV, 22.2%), and then North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW, 17.3%) (Table 1 and Table S6). "
"17","wild","This divergence was even more pronounced among captive wild rats, where breeding procedures and hygiene measures can promote or prevent the spread of S. aureus, respectively. "
"18","wild","For instance, S. aureus prevalence was very high (77.1%) in captive Toxins 2020, 12, 80 4 of 22 wild rats in Berlin (BE) (Table 1, Tables S4 and S7). "
"19","wild","In contrast, one wild rat population caught at a farm and afterwards held in husbandry in NRW was completely S. aureus-free. "

"80","wild","The detection of a LA-S. aureus lineage in captive wild rat populations years to decades after acquisition of the ancestral animals suggests a stable colonization of rats and an effective transmission to their offspring, similar to what has been observed in laboratory mice [45]. "
