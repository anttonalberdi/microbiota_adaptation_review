"2","wild","The GM structure in reintroduced GPs notably converged to that of wild pandas. "
"3","wild","Importantly, themain bacterial genera of wild GPs could aid in lignin degradation, while those of reintroduced GPs were related to cellulose and hemicellulose digestion. "
"4","wild","In addition, results suggested that increasing the ability of lignin degradation with GM may aid to change the GM of reintroduced pandas to resemble those of wild pandas. "
"5","wild","Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, GPs) are solitary animals endemic to China, and their wildlife population sizes are small (Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Schaller et al., 1985). "
"6","wild","GPs undergo a habitat environment conversion in their wildtraining process (Tang et al., 2019). "
"7","wild","Studies on thewild-training process of GPs have compared the GM composition between the captive, semiwild, reintroduced and wild GPs, whereas the influence of habitat environment on GM has received little attention (Yao et al., 2019a,b; Tang et al., 2019). "
"8","wild","Thus, approximately 14-month old and older GPs can be chosen for a wild-training process habitat conversion experiment (Yao et al., 2019a,b; Tang et al., 2019). "
"9","wild","The reintroduction of captive GPs is effective at increasing their wild population sizes andmitigating population declines. "
"10","wild","Remarkable achievements have been made in the GP conservation breeding program (e.g., through mating, artificial insemination, and parental care behaviors), contributing to the sustainment and increase in captive GP populations that can be used in reintroduction efforts to supplement wild populations (D. "
"11","wild","A recent study compared theGMof the reintroduced andwildGPs, yet robust conclusions on the influence of lifestyle on GM could not be drawn since only one reintroduced GP was available (Yao et al., 2019a,b; Tang et al., 2019). "
"12","wild","The experiment was separated into three stages: wild training I, wild training II, and reintroduction groups. "
"13","wild","The GPs were maintained in wild training I until 20–22 months old, and in wild training II for 6moremonths until theywere 26–28months old. "
"14","wild","In the wild-training, the GPs were living together with their mothers, and bamboos formed the staple food for the GPs. "
"15","wild","After learning skills to survive in the wild during wildtraining I and II, the GPswere separated from theirmothers 2–3months before being reintroduced to the natural forest environment. "
"16","wild","The feces were collected from wild GPs as controls of the reintroduced samples for the different lifestyle experiment. "
"17","wild","GPs were fitted with GPS collars during the wild-training II and reintroduction stages after approval from the State Forestry Administration of China. "
"18","wild","Wild training I and wild training II GPs lived in a large area and natural habitat or primeval forest without any disturbance by humans (the environment space of wild training II was larger than wild training I). "
"19","wild","Reintroduced GPs lived in primeval forest, where the wild GPs live. "
"20","wild","Wild-training I conditions The wild-training I area was located at the Hetaopinge Base of CCRCGP, Wolong, Sichuan (31°4′N, 103°13′E), at an altitude of approximately 2840 m. "
"21","wild","The wildtraining GPs lived with their mothers and learned skills to survive in the wild from their mothers (e.g., tree climbing skills, foraging and avoiding the danger). "
"22","wild","Each GP was trained in a separate wild training area. "
"23","wild","Wild-training II conditions The larger wild-training II facilities were located at the Tiantaishan Base, Wolong, Sichuan (31°1′N, 103°34′E). "
"24","wild","The wild training II area was constructed with steel plates and a barbed-wire fence, with a stream flowing through the area. "
"25","wild","The wild-training II area is of high biodiversity, and similar to those occupied by wild GPs in the Wolong National Natural Reserve. "
"26","wild","Each GP was trained in a separate wildtraining II area.3 2.5. "
"27","wild","Reintroduced and wild conditions According to the learning status in wild-training II, individuals G1 and G2 were chosen for reintroduction. "
"28","wild","In this area, Bashania spanostachya and Fargesia dulcicula bamboos constitute the dominant food for reintroduced and wild GPs. "
"29","wild","Habitat environment conversions and lifestyle experiments To evaluate the effects of habitat environment and lifestyle conversions, the fecal samples of GPs only bamboo fed were collected during two months before wild-training II and reintroduction, and finally one year after reintroduction to the wild. "
"30","wild","The wild-training II and reintroduced GPs were tracked with GPS collar to collect the feces. "
"31","wild","Feces of wild GPs in the natural forest environment were also collected to be compared with the feces of the reintroduced GPs. "
"32","wild","A total of 61 fecal samples from wild-training II and reintroduced GPs were collected. "
"33","wild","The habitat environment conversions comprised three stages including thewild-training I (16S rRNA sequencing n = 17; ITS sequencing n = 10), wild-training II (16S rRNA sequencing n = 16; ITS sequencing n = 12), and reintroduced (16S rRNA sequencing n = 16; ITS sequencing n=13) individuals. "
"34","wild","An additional 15 and 12 fecal samples were collected from wild GPs for 16S rRNA gene and ITS high-throughput sequencing, respectively. "

"75","wild","The relative abundance of eleven genera were significantly different between the reintroduced and wild GPs (Supplementary Fig. "
"76","wild","For example, Candida (2.8%) was more abundant in the reintroduced GPs, while Calycina (13.2%) was more abundant in the wild GPs (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). "
"77","wild","Gut microbiome dynamics associated with habitat environment conversion Consistent with the differences in GM of wild and captive primates (Clayton et al., 2016) and bears (Borbón-García et al., 2017), the richness of the gut bacteria and the richness and diversity of gut fungi of reintroduced GPs were higher than those of GPs in the beginning of wild-training. "
"78","wild","Previous studies have shown that the richness of GM of wild GPs was higher than that of captive GPs, and the higher richness could be due to exposure tomore diversemicrobial meta-communities in the natural environment (Burns et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2017). "
"79","wild","Possibly the increase in space from the beginning of the wild training to reintroduction lead to the increased resources (e.g. food, water, social interactions) (Schaller et al., 1985) and interactions with metacommunities (Schmidt et al., 2019) that contributed to the diversity and richness increase. "
"80","wild","However, Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the gut of wild-training I GPs, while Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in wild-training II and reintroduced pandas. "
"81","wild","Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the gut communities of wild-training I GPs (Wei et al., 2015), and Firmicutes in the guts of wild GPs (Zhu et al., 2011). "
"82","wild","Similarly, Firmicutes was the dominant phylum in wild deer mice and musk deer (D. "
"83","wild","At the genus level, Escherichiawas significantly enriched in thewildtraining I panda gut bacterial communities (Non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, LDA > 4). "
"84","wild","Streptococcus and Leuconostoc were more abundant in the wildtraining II GP gut communities, while Clostridium, Leuconostoc, and Turicibacter were enriched in the reintroduced GPs (Non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, LDA > 4). "
"85","wild","These genera may be involved in the digestion of bamboo in wild GPs (Oyeleke and Okusanmi, 2008; Zhu et al., 2011), which could help the GPs to gain adequate energy from limited nutritional sources.12Similar to the diet conversion experiment, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla in the GM of wild-training I, wild-training II, and reintroduced pandas, although their relative abundances varied between groups. "
"86","wild","Cryptococcus was enriched in the gut communities of wild-training II GPs, and Mrakiella was abundant in those of the reintroduced GPs. "
"87","wild","Gut microbiome dynamics associated with different lifestyle The bacterial diversity of the GM of wild GPs was higher than those of reintroduced GPs. "
"88","wild","Yao et al., reported that the semi-wild GP had less stable gut microbial community than wild GP (Yao et al., 2019a,b). "
"89","wild","The relative abundance of Firmicutes, including Clostridium, Leuconostoc and Turicibacter, was higher in the GM of the reintroduced GPs than in the GM of the wild GPs. "
"90","wild","Similar with the wild GPs in Xiaoxiangling and Minshan mountains (Yao et al., 2019a,b), Proteobacteria, including Pseudomonas, were dominant in the GM of the wild GPs. "
"91","wild","The ability of Pseudomonas to degrade secondary compounds (e.g., cyanide compounds and aromatic compounds)may be related to the high proportion of Pseudomonas in the wild GPs (Yao et al., 2019a,b; Zhu et al., 2018). "
"92","wild","In addition, the abundance of Bacteroidetes, including Sphingobacterium, was higher in the wild than in the reintroduced GPs. "
"93","wild","Thus, we speculate that the wild GPs could be adapted to higher lignin content food than the reintroduced GPs. "
"94","wild","Thus, the results suggested that additional time is needed for the complete conversion of reintroduced GP gut communities to resemble those of wild GPs. "
"95","wild","Moreover, improving the lignin degradation ability of the GM of reintroduced GPs may help its GM to become similar with that of wild GPs. "
"96","wild","Science of the Total Environment 770 (2021) 145316The relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria were higher in the wild GP communities compared to those of the reintroduced GPs (Non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, LDA> 4). "
"97","wild","However, Verrucomicrobia has not been previously detected in the guts of GPs, possibly because the focus has mostly been on captive GPs and lower number of wild GPs were included (Xue et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2019; Smits et al., 2017; Chave, 2010). "
"98","wild","The food choices of wild and reintroduced GPs were different (Schaller et al., 1985), which may explain the differences in GM between reintroduced and wild GPs. "
"99","wild","There were no significant differences in the richness and diversity of fungal GM between reintroduced andwild GPs, and no significantly different phyla were observed between the reintroduced andwild GPs. "
"100","wild","A total of 31 fungal genera were differentially abundant in the gut communities of reintroduced and wild GPs (Non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, LDA > 4), albeit only Calycina was not of low relative abundance. "
"101","wild","Calycina that was enriched in the GM of the wild GPs belongs to the order Helotiales (Zhang and Zhuang, 2004) that is associated with root endophytes (Tedersoo et al., 2010). "
"102","wild","The results suggest that wild GPs may have a more comprehensive dietary structure or more contact with microbial meta-communities compared to reintroduced GPs, whichwould then enhance the dietary diversity of reintroduced GPs and contribute to the recovery of natural gut fungal community compositions as seen in wild GPs. "
"103","wild","The composition of the fungal GM of reintroduced GPs was closer to that of wild GPs than to those of wildtraining I or wild-training II GPs, indicating that habitat environment may play an important role in shaping the GM of GPs. "
"104","wild","Taking into account the differences in the GM of the reintroduced andwild GPs may be crucial for improving the success of GP reintroduction. "
