"1","wild","Design Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis was induced in mice globally deficient in either IL-1α or IL-1β, and in wild-type mice, or in mice with conditional deletion of IL-1α in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). "
"2","wild","METHODS Mice C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Rehovot, Israel). "
"3","model","To delineate the role IL-1α and IL-1β in the development and repair of acute colon inflammation, we used the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model. "
"4","model","DSS-induced colitis model A solution of 2.5% DSS (36–50 000 kDa, MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio, USA) was administered in the drinking water for 7 days and subsequently replaced with regular water. "
"5","model","These observations are consistent with the role of IL-1β in promoting healing and scar formation.17 Indeed, studies with IL-1RI deficient mice show that the atherosclerotic process requires IL-1β to maintain plaque stability and outward vessel remodelling.31 32 The contribution of the inflammasome pathway, which leads to processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in the development of colon inflammation and carcinogenesis has been recently studied (reviewed in refs. "
"6","model","Recently, the effector function of IL-1β in activation of Th17 cells in T cell-dependent models of chronic colitis has been shown.50 The goal of further studies will be to elucidate interactions between microenvironment IL-1 and T cell activity in acute colitis. "
"7","model","The role of gut microbiota (commensal bacteria) and the mucosal barrier in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer: contribution of germ-free and gnotobiotic animal models of human diseases. "
"8","model","Genetic inactivation of IL-1 signaling enhances atherosclerotic plaque instability and reduces outward vessel remodeling in advanced atherosclerosis in mice. "
"9","knockout","IL-1α and IL-1β knockout (KO) mice were generated in the laboratory of Prof Y Iwakura. "
"10","knockout","Intestinal permeability is reduced and IL-10 levels are increased in septic IL-6 knockout mice. "
"11","disease","Results IL-1α released from damaged IECs acts as an alarmin by initiating and propagating colon inflammation, as IL-1α deficient mice exhibited mild disease symptoms with improved recovery. "
"12","disease","IL-1β is involved in repair of IECs and reconstitution of the epithelial barrier during the resolution of colitis; its deficiency correlates with disease exacerbation. "
"13","disease","INTRODUCTION Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterised by recurrent inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (reviewed in refs. "
"14","disease","Cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems and a diversity of cytokines/chemokines contribute to IBD; however, the specific role each plays in the pathogenesis of disease remains unclear (reviewed in refs. "
"15","disease","▸ Expression of IL-1 in inflamed colon tissue has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in experimental colitis. "
"16","disease","Clinical signs of colitis were recorded daily, and the disease activity index (DAI), which includes weight loss, stool consistency and occult blood in the stool, was determined. "
"17","disease","RESULTS IL-1α deficiency correlates with a mild form of colitis and enhanced tissue repair, while IL-1β deficient mice exhibit a severe and non-healing disease IL-1α KO mice were more resistant to DSS-induced colitis than WT or IL-1β KO mice and escaped the lethal consequences of DSS treatment observed in IL-1β deficient mice (figure 1A). "
"18","disease","IL-1β KO mice showed maximal permeability that correlated with the most severe form of disease (figure 3B). "
"19","disease","Colon inflammation in DSS-induced colitis is mainly mediated by innate immunity, however, at later stages, adaptive immune cells, mainly T cells, can also be activated to modulate the disease (reviewed in refs. "
"20","disease","In acute colon inflammation, specific neutralisation of IL-1α is beneficial in determining the outcome of the disease, while treatment with rIL-1Ra, which inhibits signalling of both IL-1 molecules, is not effective (figure 8). "

"36","environment","We previously showed that in vivo, IL-1β and IL-1α differ in their compartmentalisation within the producing cell or its microenvironment, resulting in distinct functions (reviewed in refs. "
"37","environment","Upon induction of apoptosis, the IL-1α precursor, which bears a nuclear localisation sequence, translocates into the nucleus, where it avidly binds to chromatin, thus preventing the release of precursor IL-1α into the microenvironment.19 However, upon cell necrosis, for example after DSS treatment, the precursor of IL-1α leaves the nucleus, relocates to the cytosol and is released from the cell (figure 4).19 The released IL-1α precursor can be further cleaved in the extracellular microenvironment by neutrophil serine proteases secreted by infiltrating myeloid cells to a more active cytokine that further amplifies colon inflammation.30 Continuous exposure of IECs to the microbiota possibly results in constitutive IL-1α expression, which can induce inflammation upon cell damage.
