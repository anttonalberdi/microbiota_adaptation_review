"1","wild","Design Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis was induced in mice globally deficient in either IL-1α or IL-1β, and in wild-type mice, or in mice with conditional deletion of IL-1α in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). "
"2","wild","METHODS Mice C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Rehovot, Israel). "
"3","model","To delineate the role IL-1α and IL-1β in the development and repair of acute colon inflammation, we used the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model. "
"4","model","DSS-induced colitis model A solution of 2.5% DSS (36–50 000 kDa, MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio, USA) was administered in the drinking water for 7 days and subsequently replaced with regular water. "
"5","model","These observations are consistent with the role of IL-1β in promoting healing and scar formation.17 Indeed, studies with IL-1RI deficient mice show that the atherosclerotic process requires IL-1β to maintain plaque stability and outward vessel remodelling.31 32 The contribution of the inflammasome pathway, which leads to processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in the development of colon inflammation and carcinogenesis has been recently studied (reviewed in refs. "
"6","model","Recently, the effector function of IL-1β in activation of Th17 cells in T cell-dependent models of chronic colitis has been shown.50 The goal of further studies will be to elucidate interactions between microenvironment IL-1 and T cell activity in acute colitis. "
"7","model","The role of gut microbiota (commensal bacteria) and the mucosal barrier in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer: contribution of germ-free and gnotobiotic animal models of human diseases. "
"8","model","Genetic inactivation of IL-1 signaling enhances atherosclerotic plaque instability and reduces outward vessel remodeling in advanced atherosclerosis in mice. "
"9","knockout","IL-1α and IL-1β knockout (KO) mice were generated in the laboratory of Prof Y Iwakura. "
"10","knockout","Intestinal permeability is reduced and IL-10 levels are increased in septic IL-6 knockout mice. "
