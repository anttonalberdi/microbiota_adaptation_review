"
"3","wild","RESULTS Intestinal epithelial TLR4 expression regulates the development of metabolic syndrome in mice To evaluate the role of intestinal epithelial TLR4 in the development of metabolic syndrome, we first administered standard chow, containing 22% calories as fat, to mice harboring floxed alleles of TLR4 (wild-type) or to ageand gender-matched mice in which TLR4 was selectively deleted from the intestinal epithelium (TLR4DIEC), from the ages of 3– 24 weeks. "
"4","wild","We observed that despite being fed standard chow, when compared with floxed wild-type mice, TLR4DIEC mice developed a constellation of symptoms consistent with metabolic syndrome,1,17 which included significant weight gain (38.64±3.829 g vs. "
"5","wild","The differences in weight gain between wild-type and TLR4DIEC mice strains became noticeable at approximately 12 weeks of age, and became significantly different from wild-type mice at 24 weeks of age (Figure 1ai). "
"6","wild","Other markers of metabolic syndrome were also observed in the TLR4DIEC but not wild-type mice, including ‘‘hepatocellular ballooning’’ which indicates the accumulation of fat droplets within hepatocytes (Figures 2a and b), a trend towards increased liver triglycerides (Supplementary Figure 1C), the histologic presence of ‘‘crown-like structures’’ within the adipose tissue (Figure 2c) indicating the accumulation of macrophages,18 and the increased expression of macrophage markers (F4/80 and Cd68) and the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype macrophage markers (Tnf and Cd11c), but not the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype macrophage marker (Retnlb), in the adipose tissue at the age of 24 weeks (Figure 2d). "
"7","wild","Despite similar serum insulin (Supplementary Figure 1E), TLR4DIEC mice but not wild-type counterparts displayed significant insulin resistance, as measured by significant hyperglycemia after the administration of an oral glucose challenge at the age of 24 weeks (Figure 2e). "
"8","wild","Given that many studies examining the development of metabolic syndrome in mice have utilized a high-fat diet, whereas the above data were observed in the presence of a ‘‘standard’’ diet, we next administered a high-fat diet in which 60% of the total calories are derived from fat to wild-type and TLR4DIEC mice from the age of 3–12 weeks. "
"9","wild","As shown in Supplementary Figure 2A, on a high-fat diet, TLR4DIEC mice still gained significantly more weight than wild-type mice (40.96±5.061 g vs. "
"10","wild","Further, although 12-week-old TLR4DIEC mice fed standard chow started to show significantly increased body weight (Figure 1ai), there was no difference between wild-type and TLR4DIEC mice in glucose tolerance (Supplementary Figure 3). "
"11","wild","On the contrary, 12-week-old TLR4DIEC mice who were fed a high-fat diet also showed impaired glucose tolerance as compared with age-matched wild-type mice fed high-fat diet (Supplementary Figure 2B). "
"12","wild","Moreover, 12-week-old TLR4DIEC mice fed highfat diet showed an increased accumulation of adipose tissue (inguinal fat and mesenteric fat) and increased liver weight (Supplementary Figure 2C), elevated serum cholesterol (Supplementary Figure 2D), but similar serum triglycerides (Supplementary Figure 2E) as compared with wild-type mice, supportive of our findings that the lack of TLR4 on the intestinal epithelium results in the development of significant weight gain, insulin resistance and other features of metabolic syndrome regardless the fat content of the diet. "
"13","wild","As shown in Figures 1a and b, the administration of standard chow containing 22% calories from fat to both TLR4 / and TLR4IEC-only resulted in similar total body weight, as well as the weight of adipose tissue and liver, compared with wild-type mice at 24 weeks of age. "

"
"27","wild","The administration of broad spectrum oral antibiotics or cohousing with wild-type mice prevented the development of metabolic syndrome in TLR4DIEC mice Given that TLR4 is a receptor for bacterial endotoxin, we next hypothesized that the effects of intestinal epithelial TLR4 on the regulation of host metabolism could be mediated in part by an effect on the intestinal microbiota. "
"28","wild","To test this possibility directly, we orally administered broad spectrum antibiotics to either wild-type or TLR4DIEC mice which were fed standard chow. "
"29","wild","The antibiotic treatment was determined to significantly reduce the bacterial load within the intestinal tract as shown in Supplementary Figure 4A, and prevented the previously observed excess weight gain observed in the TLR4DIEC strains, which were now found at similar body weights throughout the 24-week period to wild-type mice (Figure 3a) and did not show excess weight gain of the adipose tissue and liver (Figure 3b). "
"30","wild","To further evaluate the hypothesis that the effects of intestinal epithelial TLR4 on the regulation of host metabolism could be mediated through effects on the intestinal microbiota, we co-housed TLR4DIEC mice and wild-type mice together after weaning, and supplied standard chow until 24 weeks of age.

"31","wild","Importantly, co-housing resulted in similar body weight gain (Supplementary Figure 4B), similar weight of adipose tissue and liver (Supplementary Figure 4C), and similar glucose tolerance (Supplementary Figure 4D) between TLR4DIEC mice and wild-type mice, and completely reversed the previously observed metabolic syndrome phenotype. "
"32","wild","Intestinal epithelial TLR4 influences the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota in mice To further explore the role of intestinal epithelial TLR4 on the development of metabolic syndrome, we next subjected stool samples from TLR4DIEC and wild-type mice to 16S pyrosequencing followed by UniFrac clustering analysis,19 and then performed a detailed analysis of the bacterial meta-transcriptome derived from both mouse strains.

"35","wild","However, the intestinal microbiota in TLR4DIEC mice were revealed to cluster differently from those in wild-type mice (Figure 4b), and displayed a significantly lower diversity (Figure 4c). "
"36","wild","To determine the functional consequences of the loss of TLR4 within the intestinal epithelium on microbial function, we next performed a detailed metatranscriptomic analysis of the stool samples from wild-type and TLR4DIEC mice. "
"37","wild","This analysis determined that 246 clusters of orthologous groups were found to be differentially expressed between TLR4DIEC and wild-type mice which were then grouped into the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. "
"38","wild","This investigation revealed a significant alteration in several functional categories that may play a role in the development of metabolic syndrome, including the metabolism of lipid, amino acids, and nucleotides (Table 2), in the bacteria from TLR4DIEC as compared with wild-type mice, providing insights into the mechanisms by which altered bacterial signaling in response to TLR4 deficiency could lead to the development of metabolic syndrome. "
"39","wild","In seeking to investigate the potential mechanisms by which TLR4 expression in the intestinal epithelium could influence the composition of the microbiota in the first place, we observed that mRNA expression of the anti-microbial peptide lysozyme—which has an established role in regulating the composition of the intestinal microbiota and maintaining intestinal homeostasis20—was significantly reduced in the small intestine of TLR4DIEC mice as compared with wild-type mice (Supplementary Figure 5). "
"40","wild","In addition, the administration of antibiotics did not restore lysozyme ARTICLES MucosalImmunology | VOLUME 11 NUMBER 3 |MAY 2018 731 expression to wild-type levels (Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting a predominant role for intestinal TLR4 in its regulation. "
