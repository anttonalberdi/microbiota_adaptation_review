"19","disease","However, defective interactions between the luminal microbiota and intestinal immune system can lead to sustained inflammation and development of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.4,5 The intestinal epithelium is renewed at an extraordinary rate, outpacing all other tissues in the body. "
"20","disease","Extracellular DNA can activate cells of the immune system and a fine balance between proand anti-inflammatory mechanisms is required to maintain intestinal homeostasis.7,8 Innate immunity has a central role in the homeostasis of intestine and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. "
"21","disease","Paradoxically, type I IFNs can also suppress immune responses by driving production of antiinflammatory cytokines, and their deregulation contribute to progression of intestinal inflammatory diseases.18–20 Since its discovery, STING was shown to contribute to the host defense against viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens and also to the development of autoimmune disease through its aberrant activation by self DNA.21,22 Recent studies have also underscored the role of STING in regulating intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis in mice.23,24 On the other hand, high levels of microbiota-derived DNA and CDNs have been detected in the gut,25,26 and these stimuli could contribute to local activation of STING at steady state.

"
"23","disease","Lack of STING signaling reduced the frequency and function of regulatory T cells Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing Foxp3 or latencyassociated peptide (LAP) mediate suppression of a variety of immune cells and actively prevent inflammatory bowel diseases and food allergies.43,44 It has been previously shown that type I IFNs regulates Treg accumulation in the intestine and maintains their stability. "
"24","disease","RAG / mice transferred with naive CD4þCD45RBhi T cells showed histological alterations that were compatible with inflammation in gut mucosa as shown by histological analysis (Figure 5i–k), whereas co-transfer of WT CD4þCD45RBlow Treg cells with naive CD4þCD45RBhigh T cells prevented development of disease. "
"25","disease","However, co-transfer of STING / CD4þCD45RBlow Treg cells failed to prevent disease development, confirming the in vitro results that STING expression on Treg cells is required to its suppression function. "
"26","disease","The intestinal mucus layer provides a barrier limiting bacterial contact with the underlying epithelium and SIgA reduces the penetration of commensal bacteria by preventing their adhesion to the epithelium.53 Thus the presence of a normal intestinal microbiota positively influences immune responses and protects against the development of inflammatory diseases by inducing the development of several intestinal and immune-protective mechanisms since early life.
