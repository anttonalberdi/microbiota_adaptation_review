"8","mutant","This includes using tg mice that express disease-linked a-synuclein variants (e.g., p.A30P and p.E46K mutants) and, as shown here, elevated copy numbers of SNCA alleles that encode the wt human protein under its physiological promoter (e.g., Kuo et al. "

"11","model","However, the role of the olfactory system has insufficiently been explored in the pathogeneses of PD and Alzheimer disease (AD) in laboratory models. "
"12","model","The second application of the technique was to the modeling of gene–environment interactions in the nasal cavity of mice. "
"13","model","Moreover, using a bacterial sepsis model, Snca-null mice were less able to control infection after Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00702-017-1726-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. "
"14","model","However, the olfactory system remains understudied, including in routine laboratory models of PD pathogenesis. "
"15","model","The study of interactions between the exposome and genome at these sites in laboratory models of PD has been lacking. "
"16","model","The second goal in developing this technique was for the purposes of modeling and visualizing PD-linked gene interactions with the environment in the olfactory system in mice and monitoring the ensuing effects on brain health (Kitada et al. "
"17","model","We also explored a possible Snca gene–environment interaction using this infectious model and identified a role for endogenous asynuclein in the host’s innate immune defense, which we validated using a second, bacterial infection paradigm. "

"21","model","Holocranohistochemistry permits visualization of normal tau expression and amyloid-b protein plaque formation in the olfactory system To further study the applicability of whole head mounting to other models of neurodegeneration and given the abundance of physiological a-synuclein in ORNs of mice and humans, we explored a second gene, which is linked to both PD and AD. "
"22","model","Using the N5 TgCND8 mouse model, which expresses a double-mutant isoform of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and generates amyloid plaques in the brain by 3 months of age (Chishti et al. "
"23","model","Together with the findings of a-synuclein and tau expression described above, holocranohistochemistry allows us to address the normal and potentially pathological roles of these three pivotal proteins in commonly used mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. "
"24","model","Modeling a natural course of infection that begins inside the nasal cavity The second goal of developing this technique applied to the study of gene–environment interactions that begin in the olfactory system in PD-related mouse models. "
"25","model","Specifically, we focused on environmental hits that are microbial in nature, and as a first step in building these models, we established an ‘infectious challenge’ paradigm in wt mice. "
"26","model","Our ongoing studies for the role of PD-associated genes in the immune system [foremost LRRK2 (Hakimi et al. 2011)] prompted us to establish this experimental paradigm to model a natural route of infection. "
"27","model","We, therefore, chose the virulent reovirus-T3D inoculation model (with its olfactory and gastrointestinal involvement) as a platform to restage a ‘two-site entry’ paradigm (i.e., via the nose and gut) for an environmental pathogen. "
"28","model","Tomlinson et al. 123 through the bloodstream underlies the development of encephalitis in this model. "
"29","model","Holocranohistochemistry informs the modeling of complex disease in mice to test PD gene functions: example of an interaction between genetic susceptibility and an environmental trigger Holocranohistochemistry has been employed by us to routinely track reovirus-T3D infections and the ensuing immune responses in mouse models carrying modifications in PD-linked genes. "
"30","model","Given that the model requires the infection of newborn pups, we first confirmed the CNS-wide expression of endogenous a-synuclein from post-natal day P1 onward to P42 by a validated, sandwich ELISA (Fig. 4b). "
"31","model","Validation of a role for a-synuclein in innate host defense To validate our initial findings from the neurotropic reovirus model, we next tested the susceptibility of adult Sncanull mice (vs. wt animals) to a systemic bacterial infection caused by S. typhimurium, which induces lethal sepsis. "
"32","model","The study of the OE has been limited in rodent models of parkinsonism, in large part due to the separation of the nasal epithelia from the brain during routine skull dissections used for histological studies. "
"33","model","Therefore, with respect to modeling diseases in mice to pursue genetic leads, this optimized method enables the visualization of the entire olfactory system, which may be important given its relevance to both PD and AD (see Fig. 2 for example). "
"34","model","This technique is ammenable to modeling and tracking other environmental exposure events in the nasal cavity of rodents, such as of additional, virulent microbes, or of neurotropic toxins [i.e., metals, including manganese (Racette et al. "
"35","model","Our protocol could also be conducive to tracking preformed protofibril preparations of human asynuclein and their possible spread from the OE into the brain, as is currently being explored to study murine, priontype propagation models of PD pathogenesis (see review by Rey et al. "
"36","model","In modeling complex disease processes in mice we have, therefore, restaged a natural course of systemic infection using a nasal delivery paradigm, which initially leads to transient rhinitis and gastrointestinal disease (Gauvin et al. 2013), and monitored neural health in the process. "
"37","model","Taken together, our respective studies thus found a-synuclein to be protective in four, complementary, well-established in vivo infection paradigms (including in viral and bacterial models) and using three different routes of inoculation for these pathogens (i.e., intravenous, the nose pad, and subcutaneous); these routes are likely to elicit distinct responses by a mammalian host, both within immune cells and other nucleated cells. "
"38","model","Importantly, the role of a-synuclein in anti-microbial host defenses does not appear to be restricted to the brain, as suggested by results from our bacterial sepsis model (Fig. 4d). "
"39","model","To elucidate the mechanisms by which a-synuclein confers a protective role in innate immunity, molecular immunology studies using additional infectious paradigms will be required as well as the employment of nasal, systemic, and intra-cranial delivery methods in adult mice; suitable models that we will employ in such experiments will include Snca-null, wt, and PAC-transgene carrying animals that express PDlinked mutations. "
"40","model","Because the presence of fibrils has not yet been established in extracellular fluid spaces of human brain, each of these different models for disease development warrants further consideration. "
"41","model","In support of a complex disease model for typical PD, we find it tantalizing that variants of another PD gene, LRRK2, have recently been found to alter the course of microbial infections in select paradigms from experimental investigations; these were conducted in immune cells, mice, and humans to better understand its association with three complex diseases (i.e., PD, Crohn’s and leprosy) (Hakimi et al. "
"42","model","In summary, we believe that our optimized protocol for carrying out the method of holocranohistochemistry promises to inform future studies in the following three ways: one, to better model the complex interactions between environmental pathogens and distinct risk alleles (e.g., SNCA, MAPT, and APP) in the nasal cavity and oropharynx.
