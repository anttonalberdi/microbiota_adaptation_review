"11","model","However, the role of the olfactory system has insufficiently been explored in the pathogeneses of PD and Alzheimer disease (AD) in laboratory models. "

"14","model","However, the olfactory system remains understudied, including in routine laboratory models of PD pathogenesis. "
"15","model","The study of interactions between the exposome and genome at these sites in laboratory models of PD has been lacking. "

"23","model","Together with the findings of a-synuclein and tau expression described above, holocranohistochemistry allows us to address the normal and potentially pathological roles of these three pivotal proteins in commonly used mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. "
"24","model","Modeling a natural course of infection that begins inside the nasal cavity The second goal of developing this technique applied to the study of gene–environment interactions that begin in the olfactory system in PD-related mouse models. "
"25","model","Specifically, we focused on environmental hits that are microbial in nature, and as a first step in building these models, we established an ‘infectious challenge’ paradigm in wt mice. "
"26","model","Our ongoing studies for the role of PD-associated genes in the immune system [foremost LRRK2 (Hakimi et al. 2011)] prompted us to establish this experimental paradigm to model a natural route of infection. "
"27","model","We, therefore, chose the virulent reovirus-T3D inoculation model (with its olfactory and gastrointestinal involvement) as a platform to restage a ‘two-site entry’ paradigm (i.e., via the nose and gut) for an environmental pathogen. "
"28","model","Tomlinson et al. 123 through the bloodstream underlies the development of encephalitis in this model. "
"29","model","Holocranohistochemistry informs the modeling of complex disease in mice to test PD gene functions: example of an interaction between genetic susceptibility and an environmental trigger Holocranohistochemistry has been employed by us to routinely track reovirus-T3D infections and the ensuing immune responses in mouse models carrying modifications in PD-linked genes. "
"30","model","Given that the model requires the infection of newborn pups, we first confirmed the CNS-wide expression of endogenous a-synuclein from post-natal day P1 onward to P42 by a validated, sandwich ELISA (Fig. 4b). "
"31","model","Validation of a role for a-synuclein in innate host defense To validate our initial findings from the neurotropic reovirus model, we next tested the susceptibility of adult Sncanull mice (vs. wt animals) to a systemic bacterial infection caused by S. typhimurium, which induces lethal sepsis. "
"32","model","The study of the OE has been limited in rodent models of parkinsonism, in large part due to the separation of the nasal epithelia from the brain during routine skull dissections used for histological studies. "
"33","model","Therefore, with respect to modeling diseases in mice to pursue genetic leads, this optimized method enables the visualization of the entire olfactory system, which may be important given its relevance to both PD and AD (see Fig. 2 for example). "
"34","model","This technique is ammenable to modeling and tracking other environmental exposure events in the nasal cavity of rodents, such as of additional, virulent microbes, or of neurotropic toxins [i.e., metals, including manganese (Racette et al. "
"35","model","Our protocol could also be conducive to tracking preformed protofibril preparations of human asynuclein and their possible spread from the OE into the brain, as is currently being explored to study murine, priontype propagation models of PD pathogenesis (see review by Rey et al. "
"36","model","In modeling complex disease processes in mice we have, therefore, restaged a natural course of systemic infection using a nasal delivery paradigm, which initially leads to transient rhinitis and gastrointestinal disease (Gauvin et al. 2013), and monitored neural health in the process. "
"37","model","Taken together, our respective studies thus found a-synuclein to be protective in four, complementary, well-established in vivo infection paradigms (including in viral and bacterial models) and using three different routes of inoculation for these pathogens (i.e., intravenous, the nose pad, and subcutaneous); these routes are likely to elicit distinct responses by a mammalian host, both within immune cells and other nucleated cells. "
"38","model","Importantly, the role of a-synuclein in anti-microbial host defenses does not appear to be restricted to the brain, as suggested by results from our bacterial sepsis model (Fig. 4d). "
"39","model","To elucidate the mechanisms by which a-synuclein confers a protective role in innate immunity, molecular immunology studies using additional infectious paradigms will be required as well as the employment of nasal, systemic, and intra-cranial delivery methods in adult mice; suitable models that we will employ in such experiments will include Snca-null, wt, and PAC-transgene carrying animals that express PDlinked mutations. "
"40","model","Because the presence of fibrils has not yet been established in extracellular fluid spaces of human brain, each of these different models for disease development warrants further consideration. "
"41","model","In support of a complex disease model for typical PD, we find it tantalizing that variants of another PD gene, LRRK2, have recently been found to alter the course of microbial infections in select paradigms from experimental investigations; these were conducted in immune cells, mice, and humans to better understand its association with three complex diseases (i.e., PD, Crohn’s and leprosy) (Hakimi et al. "
"42","model","In summary, we believe that our optimized protocol for carrying out the method of holocranohistochemistry promises to inform future studies in the following three ways: one, to better model the complex interactions between environmental pathogens and distinct risk alleles (e.g., SNCA, MAPT, and APP) in the nasal cavity and oropharynx.

"50","disease","This article is an open access publication Abstract Braak and Del Tredici have proposed that typical Parkinson disease (PD) has its origins in the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal tract. "

"
"53","disease","In accordance, studying the olfactory system and the role of disease-linked genes expressed in it may provide important insights into disease etiology. "
"54","disease","The olfactory and gastrointestinal systems lay at the interface between the host and his/her environment, and could serve as sites of exposure to environmental disease initiating factor(s) (reviewed by Rey et al. "
"55","disease","Specifically, given the role of a-synuclein in PD pathogenesis and the early detection of Lewy pathology in the OB during the prodromal phase of disease as per Braak and Del Tredici’s classification scheme (and the associated hyposmia), we probed for asynuclein expression in the olfactory system in newborn (as young as P3) and aged (up to 24-month-old) mice. "
"56","disease","The role of physiological tau in the olfactory epithelium, e.g., in odour processing, and how its metabolism may relate to disease pathogenesis (including of PD and AD) remain unknown and warrant further study. "
"57","disease","Together with the findings of a-synuclein and tau expression described above, holocranohistochemistry allows us to address the normal and potentially pathological roles of these three pivotal proteins in commonly used mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. "

"
"59","disease","Our ultimate goal is to examine interactions between genetic susceptibility (to PD) and environmental triggers as they relate to brain health and possible disease pathogenesis. "
"60","disease","This suggested that an altered host response to the infection resulted in increased disease severity. "
"61","disease","Studying the functional implications of distinct human alleles, including those at the SNCA and MAPT loci, within the olfactory system (and the enteric nervous system) promises to provide insights into their still elusive, pathological contributions to PD pathogenesis, in particular during the initiation of the disease. "
"62","disease","Therefore, with respect to modeling diseases in mice to pursue genetic leads, this optimized method enables the visualization of the entire olfactory system, which may be important given its relevance to both PD and AD (see Fig. 2 for example). "
"63","disease","Our goal was to create a tool that allowed us to monitor the olfactory system in a ‘complex disease’ paradigm during gene–environment interaction studies in a rodent, as they possibly relate to the development of PD and AD. "
"64","disease","As ‘CLARITY’-based imaging studies have expanded the field of neuroscience through its 3D imaging applications (Chung and Deisseroth 2013), thereby markedly enhancing the perception of connectivity within the brain itself, holocranohistochemistry promises to enhance the field of neurodegeneration by providing the anatomical integrity of both intraand extra-cranial structures that are likely involved in disease development. "
"65","disease","Although previously described in humans and explored in select disease processes, metabolic studies of these proteins (as well as of APP) in the healthy OE and CN-I axons of wt animals and genetically modified mice have not been previously carried out. "
"66","disease","We view idiopathic PD in the context of a complex disease, in which genetic susceptibility conspires with an environmental trigger to initiate pathogenesis (Kitada et al. "
"67","disease","In modeling complex disease processes in mice we have, therefore, restaged a natural course of systemic infection using a nasal delivery paradigm, which initially leads to transient rhinitis and gastrointestinal disease (Gauvin et al. 2013), and monitored neural health in the process. "
"68","disease","The appendix has been implicated as a ‘storage site’ for healthy, commensal gut organisms, responsible for replenishing the intestinal microbiome subsequent to its depletion in certain disease states (such as severe diarrhea). "
"69","disease","While elevated a-synuclein and its dysregulated metabolism are clearly associated with the propagation and/or progression of the disease (foremost of its microscopically detectable proteinopathy, including in familial cases), perhaps, this is independent of its association with the risk of developing PD, i.e., with the actual initiation of disease. "
"70","disease","Currently, most investigators for the etiology of late-onset PD interpret these biomarker findings (i.e., of low a-synuclein levels) to reflect secondary changes in response to a disease process that is already underway. "
"71","disease","If that were to be the case, then distinct variants at the SNCA andMAPT loci would be involved in a whole spectrum of diseasepromoting mechanisms, i.e., from co-regulating overall susceptibility to PD at a site where gene–environment interactions occur, to participating in the ensuing tissue responses that propagate disease, and in doing so, to ultimately co-regulating the phenotypic expressivity of an asynuclein-related disorder. "
"72","disease","As recently vigorously debated, disease progression in PD could be explained by a prion-like propagation of asynuclein itself across synapses (reviewed in: Walsh and Selkoe 2016; Rey et al. 2016); alternatively, an ‘initiating factor’, i.e., an environment-derived pathogen that leads to a-synuclein dysregulation within affected neurons (rather 734 J. "
"73","disease","Because the presence of fibrils has not yet been established in extracellular fluid spaces of human brain, each of these different models for disease development warrants further consideration. "
"74","disease","As such, and to further explore the relevance of our findings to PD etiology and/or pathogenesis, in future studies, we will monitor changes in asynucleinmetabolism, neuropathology, and disease-relevant behavioural outcomes in response to chronic, non-lethal infection paradigms in adult mice. "
"75","disease","This includes using tg mice that express disease-linked a-synuclein variants (e.g., p.A30P and p.E46K mutants) and, as shown here, elevated copy numbers of SNCA alleles that encode the wt human protein under its physiological promoter (e.g., Kuo et al. "

"
"77","disease","Hopefully, this will provide more insights into the actual initiation of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders in humans; two, to delineate how natural infections, such as those in the nasal cavity, will alter the metabolism of proteins that are encoded by disease-linked risk alleles; and three, to better design studies in laboratory animals that capture systemic health outcomes as well as nervous system readouts when studying interactions between the host’s genome and his/her exposome.

"117","environment","The second application of the technique was to the modeling of gene–environment interactions in the nasal cavity of mice. "
"118","environment","Typical, late-onset (i.e., ‘idiopathic’) PD is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility coupled to unknown environmental triggers that may be toxinbased or microbial in nature, as well as by sustained tissue responses, effects of gender, and the passage of time (Kitada et al. "
"119","environment","The olfactory and gastrointestinal systems lay at the interface between the host and his/her environment, and could serve as sites of exposure to environmental disease initiating factor(s) (reviewed by Rey et al. "
"120","environment","There, ORNs bridge the environment with the brain for the purpose of smell signalling: their dendrites extend toward the ethmoid sinus and their axons form cranial nerve (CN)-I bundles within the lamina propria. "
"121","environment","The second goal in developing this technique was for the purposes of modeling and visualizing PD-linked gene interactions with the environment in the olfactory system in mice and monitoring the ensuing effects on brain health (Kitada et al. "
"122","environment","We also explored a possible Snca gene–environment interaction using this infectious model and identified a role for endogenous asynuclein in the host’s innate immune defense, which we validated using a second, bacterial infection paradigm. "
"123","environment","Modeling a natural course of infection that begins inside the nasal cavity The second goal of developing this technique applied to the study of gene–environment interactions that begin in the olfactory system in PD-related mouse models. "
"124","environment","Specifically, we focused on environmental hits that are microbial in nature, and as a first step in building these models, we established an ‘infectious challenge’ paradigm in wt mice. "
"125","environment","We, therefore, chose the virulent reovirus-T3D inoculation model (with its olfactory and gastrointestinal involvement) as a platform to restage a ‘two-site entry’ paradigm (i.e., via the nose and gut) for an environmental pathogen. "
"126","environment","Holocranohistochemistry informs the modeling of complex disease in mice to test PD gene functions: example of an interaction between genetic susceptibility and an environmental trigger Holocranohistochemistry has been employed by us to routinely track reovirus-T3D infections and the ensuing immune responses in mouse models carrying modifications in PD-linked genes. "
"127","environment","Our ultimate goal is to examine interactions between genetic susceptibility (to PD) and environmental triggers as they relate to brain health and possible disease pathogenesis. "
"128","environment","The olfactory epithelium (OE) represents an intranasal gateway to the remainder of the olfactory system and the brain, sitting outside the cribriform plate at the interface of the host and his/her environment. "
"129","environment","Our goal was to create a tool that allowed us to monitor the olfactory system in a ‘complex disease’ paradigm during gene–environment interaction studies in a rodent, as they possibly relate to the development of PD and AD. "
"130","environment","In our case, holocranohistochemistry enabled the step-by-step tracking of an environmental pathogen once present within the nasal cavity. "
"131","environment","This technique is ammenable to modeling and tracking other environmental exposure events in the nasal cavity of rodents, such as of additional, virulent microbes, or of neurotropic toxins [i.e., metals, including manganese (Racette et al. "
"132","environment","We view idiopathic PD in the context of a complex disease, in which genetic susceptibility conspires with an environmental trigger to initiate pathogenesis (Kitada et al. "
"133","environment","Importantly, we are interested in environmental hits that are microbial in nature, supported in part by the emerging role of PD-linked genes, including LRRK2, in the immune system (Hakimi et al. "
"134","environment","Theoretically, variants at the SNCA and MAPT loci, as identified by GWAS, could alter the expression levels of their encoded proteins, either systemically or at select sites within the nervous system, thereby modifying host responses to environmental pathogens [as part of each subject’s ‘exposome’ risk (Rappaport 2016)]. "
"135","environment","If that were to be the case, then distinct variants at the SNCA andMAPT loci would be involved in a whole spectrum of diseasepromoting mechanisms, i.e., from co-regulating overall susceptibility to PD at a site where gene–environment interactions occur, to participating in the ensuing tissue responses that propagate disease, and in doing so, to ultimately co-regulating the phenotypic expressivity of an asynuclein-related disorder. "
"136","environment","As recently vigorously debated, disease progression in PD could be explained by a prion-like propagation of asynuclein itself across synapses (reviewed in: Walsh and Selkoe 2016; Rey et al. 2016); alternatively, an ‘initiating factor’, i.e., an environment-derived pathogen that leads to a-synuclein dysregulation within affected neurons (rather 734 J. "
"137","environment","In summary, we believe that our optimized protocol for carrying out the method of holocranohistochemistry promises to inform future studies in the following three ways: one, to better model the complex interactions between environmental pathogens and distinct risk alleles (e.g., SNCA, MAPT, and APP) in the nasal cavity and oropharynx. "
"138","human","Furthermore, we observed amyloid-b plaques and proteinase-K-resistant a-synuclein species, respectively, in cranial nerve-I of APPand human SNCA-over-expressing mice. "
"139","human","These factors interact to bring about the progressive demise of dopamine neurons in the human Substantia nigra and other brainstem nuclei. "
"140","human","Although these proteins have been identified in autopsy material of human OE (Arnold et al. "
"141","human","Post mortem, human tissue samples were collected at 722 J. "
"142","human","; Snca-/mice, on an FBV/Nx129S6 background have 4 insertions of the human SNCA locus, as described (Kuo et al. "
"143","human","For development, the following primary antibodies were used: anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (anti-TH by Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada; 1:5000); hSA4 (a non-commercial, polyclonal Ab, that was raised and affinity-purified against recombinant, full length, human a-synuclein as described (Mollenhauer et al. 2008); 1:250–1:1000; [of note, its monoclonal Ab derivative is commercially available as MJFR1 from Abcam and its staining characteristics were described in Gray et al. "
"144","human","For survival assay, a moribund state of ensuing encephalitis was selected as the humane endpoint (as approved by the animal care ethics review board), upon which mice were euthanized (by CO2 narcosis) and ear tissue was collected for genotyping. "
"145","human","Of particular interest to us was the abundant expression of a-synuclein that was detected by multiple antibodies within ORNs in mice (Fig. 2a–g), which was also visualized in human OE tissue collected at autopsy (Fig. 2i), as previously reported (Duda et al. "
"146","human","This observation was true for both human and murine a-synuclein expressed in respective mouse models [dbl-PAC-tg(SNCAA53T)?"

"
"149","human","For example, to determine whether human a-synuclein expression levels and soluble oligomer formation within the olfactory system correlated with altered olfaction in the PAC-tg(SNCAA53T); Snca-/mice, we compared age-matched mice that carried 2 versus 4 insertions of the PAC-transgene encoding the human SNCA locus (in the absence of murine Snca) (Kuo et al. "
"150","human","Holocranohistochemistry permits visualization of normal tau expression and amyloid-b protein plaque formation in the olfactory system To further study the applicability of whole head mounting to other models of neurodegeneration and given the abundance of physiological a-synuclein in ORNs of mice and humans, we explored a second gene, which is linked to both PD and AD. "
"151","human","Like tau, Ab protein is an essential factor in AD pathogenesis (Selkoe 2007), and has been reported to be expressed in resected human olfactory epithelium, where its presence correlated with the severity of AD (Arnold et al. "

"153","human","In the brain, we readily visualized the presence of Ab plaques using H&E and Thioflavin-T staining (not shown), which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using antibody 4G8 to human Ab (Fig. 2s–u). "
"154","human","Studying the functional implications of distinct human alleles, including those at the SNCA and MAPT loci, within the olfactory system (and the enteric nervous system) promises to provide insights into their still elusive, pathological contributions to PD pathogenesis, in particular during the initiation of the disease. "
"155","human","Our protocol could also be conducive to tracking preformed protofibril preparations of human asynuclein and their possible spread from the OE into the brain, as is currently being explored to study murine, priontype propagation models of PD pathogenesis (see review by Rey et al. "
"156","human","Although previously described in humans and explored in select disease processes, metabolic studies of these proteins (as well as of APP) in the healthy OE and CN-I axons of wt animals and genetically modified mice have not been previously carried out. "
"157","human","Of note, in contrast to the report by Park et al., Holocranohistochemistry enables a-synuclein visualization and discovery of anti-microbial function 733 123 in our own studies, we did not observe a direct, anti-microbial, and AMP-type effect for either monomeric (recombinant), human a-synuclein, or for dopamine treatment-induced, oligomeric a-synuclein using bacterial cultures of three different organisms (unpublished results). "
"158","human","Its mechanisms of action are likely pathogen-, cell-type-, and/or immune organ-dependent, and likely include the spleen and, in humans, the appendix (Gray et al. "
"159","human","Whether the anti-microbial role of a-synuclein in vivo is pathogenetically related to idiopathic PD and other, sporadic synucleinopathies (Ingelsson 2016), remains to be determined; similarly, whether an elevation of (or reduction in) systemic risk for microbial illnesses could underlie the development of PD variants in long-lived humans is currently unclear. "
"160","human","In doing so, a-synuclein and tau could contribute to the overall susceptibility of a human subject to develop PD. "
"161","human","Because the presence of fibrils has not yet been established in extracellular fluid spaces of human brain, each of these different models for disease development warrants further consideration. "
"162","human","This includes using tg mice that express disease-linked a-synuclein variants (e.g., p.A30P and p.E46K mutants) and, as shown here, elevated copy numbers of SNCA alleles that encode the wt human protein under its physiological promoter (e.g., Kuo et al. "
"163","human","In support of a complex disease model for typical PD, we find it tantalizing that variants of another PD gene, LRRK2, have recently been found to alter the course of microbial infections in select paradigms from experimental investigations; these were conducted in immune cells, mice, and humans to better understand its association with three complex diseases (i.e., PD, Crohn’s and leprosy) (Hakimi et al. "
"164","human","Hopefully, this will provide more insights into the actual initiation of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders in humans; two, to delineate how natural infections, such as those in the nasal cavity, will alter the metabolism of proteins that are encoded by disease-linked risk alleles; and three, to better design studies in laboratory animals that capture systemic health outcomes as well as nervous system readouts when studying interactions between the host’s genome and his/her exposome.
