"1","wild","In this study, wild-type C57BL6 mice were subjected to ICR and concomitant single intraperitoneal antibiotic injection. "
"2","wild","The present study analyzed conventionally raised C57BL6 wild type mice after ICR to elucidate the impact of ICR and concomitant antibiotic dose on the microbiota in remnant jejunum and proximal colon in the absence of any ongoing disease. "
"3","wild","DNA samples were prepared from intestinal lumen contents of wild type C57BL6 mice including non-ICR controls and mice at 3 different time points after ICR. "
"4","wild","In the present study we chose conventionally raised C57BL6 wild type mice after ICR as the initial step to elucidate the impact of ICR on the microbiota in remnant jejunum and proximal colon without the influence of the genetic background of the host or ongoing disease. "
"5","wild","However, a previous study by Rigby et al [27] showed that ICR results in persistent postsurgical inflammation in the small intestine and anastomosis of conventionalized IL10 null mice but not conventional wild-type animals at 28 days after ICR. "
"6","adaptat","We selected day 7 after ICR because at this time point we have previously reported that the expansion of crypts that contribute to long term adaptation is initiated along with acute changes in proliferation and crypt depth and villus height [24,27,42]. "

"8","adaptat","(2007) Expansion of intestinal stem cells associated with long-term adaptation following ileocecal resection in mice. "
"9","model","In the present study, a mouse model of ICR previously developed by Dekaney et al. [24] was used to determine the impact of ICR on the microbiota in murine jejunum and colon. "
"10","model","Other commonly used resection models include proximal small bowel resection in rat, pig or mouse models [25] but we developed the ICR model since ICR is a more frequent surgery in humans than proximal small bowel resection. "
"11","model","An ICR model has also been developed in rats [26] but a mouse model has the potential advantage that it can be applied to genetically manipulated mice that develop spontaneous gastrointestinal diseases, such as IBD models [27]. "
"12","model","Therefore, these time points allow for the comparison of sustained changes in the microbiota during both the acute and sustained adaptive response in our animal model. "
"13","model","These results are consistent with ICR in this murine model leading to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition common in human patients who undergo ICR to treat CD [14]. "
"14","model","However, our findings in the murine model indicate that early after ICR, in the first 7 days, there is a divergence of jejunal and colonic bacteria such that certain phyla like Deferribacteres were represented at high proportions in 2 of 3 jejunal samples, but were not detected in the colon. "
"15","model","Dekaney et al. [24] used the ICR mouse model to show that the remnant jejunum exhibits adaptive growth after ICR, resulting in an increase in crypt depth and villus height by 7 days and increase in mucosal circumference by 6 weeks. "
"16","model","The main modification of the lumen environment caused by ICR is an increase in unabsorbed bile acids that induces an increase in the expression of genes responsible for bile salt uptake in colonocytes in the mouse ICR model [55]. "
"17","model","The current study defines ICR-induced changes in microbiota in a murine model, and we have previously documented ability to perform ICR under germ-free conditions [27]. "

"
"21","disease","The changes in jejunal and colonic microbiota induced by ICR and concomitant antibiotic injection may therefore be considered as potential regulators of post-surgical adaptive growth or function, and in a setting of active IBD, potential contributors to post-surgical pathophysiology of disease recurrence.

"41","environment","It could be speculated that members of this family are more resistant to the dramatic changes in the intestinal environment during or immediately after ICR, which potentially include increased oxygen due to the surgical intervention itself, increased bile acids reaching the colon (and indirectly the jejunum) due to loss of ileum or altered microbial populations themselves. "
"42","environment","This malabsorption leads to a luminal environment rich in bile salts, which can affect survival of bile intolerant commensal microbiota, contribute to nutrient malabsorption, diarrhea and mucosal damage. "
"43","environment","The main modification of the lumen environment caused by ICR is an increase in unabsorbed bile acids that induces an increase in the expression of genes responsible for bile salt uptake in colonocytes in the mouse ICR model [55]. "
"44","environment","We could hypothesize that the increase in bile acids in the intestinal lumen due to the loss of ileal reabsorption perturbs the lumen environment and contributes to the reduced diversity of small bowel and colonic microbiota, opening up niches that can then be occupied by bile resistant bacteria. "
"45","environment","In an environment where bile acids are increased, this bacterial group could potentially out-compete other members of the intestinal microbiota leading to higher concentrations of secondary bile acids. "
"46","environment","Information about the biological characteristics of bacteria that can withstand the altered luminal environment after ICR is essential to rational design of alternative therapies, including probiotic or prebiotic therapies to improve outcome in post-surgical CD or SBS. "
"47","environment","This will permit future studies aimed at colonization with specific microbiota after ICR to define those microorganisms that may survive in the altered luminal environment and potentially impact restoration of normal function. "
