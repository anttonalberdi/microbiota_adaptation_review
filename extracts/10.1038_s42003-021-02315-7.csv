"14","wild","Of increasing interest in conservation biology is to understand the evolutionary responses of wildlife to human-driven selection pressures18. "
"15","wild","Our results show that the gut microbiomes of spiny rat individuals inhabiting fragmented landscapes with additional anthropogenic disturbance (such as contact to domesticated animals, invasive species, humans, and their pathogens) had lower alpha diversity and a shifted and more dispersed gut bacterial community composition, indicating that human disturbances at the landscape level can have both location and dispersion effects on the gut microbiomes of wildlife, even in generalist species that are considered to be more resilient to environmental changes9.

"31","model","We used generalized linear mixed models, which allowed us to control for the lack of independence due to site-specific effects within landscapes and extraction batches. "
"32","model","Using model selection based on the information-theoretic (IT) approach24, we found very strong support for an effect of landscape on all three alpha diversity metrics: observed number of ASVs (ΔAICC= 19.63, R2GLMM(m)= 0.473, R2GLMM(c)= 0.579, Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 1); Shannon diversity, in which alpha diversity is weighted for abundance (ΔAICC= 5.84, R2GLMM(m)= 0.150, R2GLMM(c)= 0.171, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 2); and Faith’s PD, which controls for phylogenetic relatedness (ΔAICC= 6.05, R2GLMM(m)= 0.438, R2GLMM(c)= 0.480, Supplementary Fig. "
"33","model","The effects of field season and sex were poorly supported by AICC model comparison for any of the three alpha diversity metrics (Supplementary Data 1–3). "
"34","model","In addition, in all three alpha diversity models, spatial autocorrelation between capture sites was poorly supported by AICC model comparison (Supplementary Data 5) and, because models including this parameter were less parsimonious than their counterparts without the parameter, we opted against including this parameter in our final alpha diversity models. "
"35","model","However, because the ‘strata’ argument impacts p-values but not the calculation of AICC, we report results from both null hypothesis significance testing and IT model selection. "
"36","model","Again, using IT model selection, we found strong support for an effect of landscape type on compositional shifts in beta diversity with regards to both weighted (ΔAICC= 53.29, PCoA axis 1: Cohen’s dA-C= −1.053 (95% CI=−1.332 to −0.771), Cohen’s dA-I=−1.110 (95% CI=−1.375 to −0.841), Cohen’s dC-I=−0.030 (95% CI= −0.286 to 0.227); PCoA axis 2: Cohen’s dA-C=−0.904 (95% CI=−1.176 to −0.629), Cohen’s dA-I=−0.847 (95% CI= −1.100 to −0.593), Cohen’s dC-I= 0.109 (95% CI=−0.148 to 0.365); Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 6) and unweighted UniFrac distance metrics (ΔAICC= 21.74, PCoA axis 1: Cohen’s dA-C= −1.501 (95% CI=−1.805 to −1.193), Cohen’s dA-I=−1.501 (95% CI=−1.790 to −1.208), Cohen’s dC-I= 0.058 (95% CI= −0.198 to 0.314); PCoA axis 2: Cohen’s dA-C=−1.427 (95% CI=−1.428 to −0.857), Cohen’s dA-I=−0.684 (95% CI= −0.930 to −0.436), Cohen’s dC-I= 0.499 (95% CI= 0.233 to 0.763); Fig. 1d, Supplementary Data 7). "
"37","model","The effects of field season and sex for both PERMANOVA and PERMDISP2 analyses were poorly supported by AICC model comparison, regardless of the UniFrac metric used (Supplementary Data 7-10). "
"38","model","In addition, in all PERMDISP2 models, spatial autocorrelation between capture sites was poorly supported by AICC model comparison (Supplementary Data 12) and, because models including this parameter were less parsimonious than their counterparts without the parameter, we opted against including this parameter in our final PERMDISP2 models. "
"39","model","In addition, hemotrophic mycoplasma are known to infect dogs and cats53, while Odoribacter—isolated from the oral microbiomes of dogs and cats—causes periodontitis in infected animals54, and the family Erysipelotrichaceae has been linked to gut inflammation in mice models and metabolic disorders in hamster models55. "
"40","model","Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) from the lme4 package98 (version 1.1.21), we modeled alpha diversity according to landscape (landscape C, landscape I, and landscape A) and sequencing depth to account for differential sequencing effort between samples99. "
"41","model","To facilitate model convergence, sequencing depth was scaled. "
"42","model","We used a negative binomial error distribution when modeling the count data (observed ASVs) and a gamma distribution with a log link function when modeling the continuous data (Shannon diversity and Faith’s PD). "
"43","model","Model selection was based on the information-theoretic (IT) approach using a second order Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICC) as an information criterion and Akaike weights (ω) to determine model support24. "
"44","model","For all GLMMs, we report both conditional and marginal coefficients of determination of each model (R2GLMM(c), which explains the variance of both the fixed and random factors, and R2GLMM(m), which explains the variance of the fixed factors only)104, which we calculated as the variance explained by the best model, the ΔAICC, conditional parameter estimates (β), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using model averaging with a cumulative AICCω of 95%24. "
"45","model","In the main body of the article, we present back-transformed parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals for models with a log link function, while the log transformed versions of these values are presented in the Supplementary Data. "
"46","model","Finally, we tested for spatial autocorrelation between the capture sites using a spatial exponential covariance structure on the scaled capture site coordinates in each of the three alpha diversity models using the glmmTMB package105 (version 0.2.3). "
"47","model","The fixed variables in our full model were: landscape, sex, field season, extraction batch, and sequencing depth. "
"48","model","We retained extraction batch in our full model to statistically account for its model support (Supplementary Data 6 and 7). "
"49","model","We then passed every possible combination of our full model through the adonis function to generate a model selection table sorted according to AICC values (as described above), which we calculated using the AICC equation24 with input values from the ‘residuals’ and ‘sum of squares’ output of the adonis function. "
"50","model","We report coefficients of determination of each model (R2). "
"51","model","In addition to building a model selection table sorted according to AICC values, we also subjected this PERMANOVA test to null hypothesis significance testing with 9999 permutations and present p-values, F-values, and R2. "
"52","model","We then modeled the distances to the centroids using GLMMs from the lme4 package98 with a gamma distribution and log link function for continuous data. "
"53","model","The explanatory variables and random factor variables were the same as described above for the alpha diversity metrics, as was the model selection process and the testing for spatial autocorrelation between the capture sites. "
"54","model","However, controlling for host density did not quantitatively change our results (compare Supplementary Data 1-4 and 6-11 to Supplementary Data 13-22) and, in order to not overparameterize our models, we chose to exclude this variable in our final analysis, though we present the results in the Supplementary Information.

"
"96","human","The three landscapes encompassed: (1) protected continuous tropical forests and (2) protected forested islands in the Panama Canal that allow us to study the effects of fragmentation on its own— both landscapes are largely undisturbed by human activities—and (3) nearby unprotected forested fragments embedded in an agricultural matrix that are subjected to further anthropogenic disturbances in addition to habitat fragmentation. "
"97","human","By comparing both protected landscapes to heavily human-disturbed, fragmented sites, our unique study design allowed us to, first, pick apart the effects of habitat fragmentation (i.e., habitat reduction and isolation) from those of additional anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and pathogens within an agricultural matrix) on the gut microbiome and, second, to meticulously characterize the changes in gut community composition and metagenomic functional potential. "
"98","human","Because lower alpha diversity was observed in human-disturbed, fragmented landscapes (A), but in neither of the protected landscapes with (I) and without (C) habitat fragmentation, these results indicate that habitat fragmentation per se does not impact gut bacterial diversity within individuals, but that its combination with additional anthropogenic disturbance does.

"104","human","In this study, we observed two distinct patterns of gut microbial community change in spiny rats inhabiting fragmented landscapes with additional anthropogenic disturbance that were not observed in spiny rats inhabiting protected landscapes without additional human impact: gut microbial compositional shifts and greater dispersion in beta diversity. "
"105","human","Such processes could be driven by the random colonization of bacteria novel to the individual’s gut microbiome in the anthropogenically more disturbed landscape or by random extinction of resident bacteria in the face of novel competition caused by some spiny rat individuals that come into more intense contact with human activities than others, perhaps due to the proximity of their home range to the edges between the forest patches and the agricultural matrix humans live in.
