"3","wild","Changes to wildlife gut microbiomes due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation, can disrupt natural gut microbiota homeostasis and make animals vulnerable to infections that may become zoonotic. "
"4","wild","However, it remains unclear whether the disruption to wildlife gut microbiomes is caused by habitat fragmentation per se or the combination of habitat fragmentation with additional anthropogenic disturbances, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and their pathogens. "
"5","wild","On the other hand, the greater variation in community structure and reduced alpha diversity may signal a decline in beneficial microbial functions and illustrate that gut adaption may not catch up with anthropogenic disturbances, even in a generalist species with large phenotypic plasticity, with potentially harmful consequences to both wildlife and human health. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02315-7 OPEN 1 Ulm University, Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Conservation Genomics, Ulm, Germany.

"
"7","wild","Human activities that may lead to such a disturbance are manifold and include habitat fragmentation and isolation, whose negative impacts on wildlife health can be amplified by additional factors, such as the presence of and contact with humans3,4, domesticated animals5,6, invasive species7, and pathogens7. "
"8","wild","Examining their ability to alter their gut microbial composition and its genes, known as metagenomic plasticity, when faced with human-driven environmental changes could help to understand the dynamics of emerging diseases from wildlife. "
"9","wild","In the Anthropocene, habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances threaten wildlife18. "
"10","wild","Their effects on the gut microbiome have been studied together19–22, but there is a gap in understanding if habitat fragmentation per se perturbs the gut microbiome or if the amplification by additional anthropogenic factors, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and pathogens poses a greater threat to wildlife gut microbial health. "
"11","wild","Considering its integral role in host health, such a loss could not only be detrimental to wildlife health, but could also promote microbial pathogens with zoonotic potential. "
"12","wild","This suggests that human disturbances at the landscape level can both shift gut microbial community structure and increase community dispersion in wildlife gut microbiomes, even in generalist species that are considered to be more resilient to environmental changes9. "

"
"14","wild","Of increasing interest in conservation biology is to understand the evolutionary responses of wildlife to human-driven selection pressures18. "
"15","wild","Our results show that the gut microbiomes of spiny rat individuals inhabiting fragmented landscapes with additional anthropogenic disturbance (such as contact to domesticated animals, invasive species, humans, and their pathogens) had lower alpha diversity and a shifted and more dispersed gut bacterial community composition, indicating that human disturbances at the landscape level can have both location and dispersion effects on the gut microbiomes of wildlife, even in generalist species that are considered to be more resilient to environmental changes9. "
"16","wild","Wildlife health and susceptibility to pathogens play important roles in the Anthropocene, as humans come into increasing contact with potentially maladaptive wildlife, which could lead to the transmission of zoonotic diseases. "
"17","wild","As human encroachment into wildlife habitats increases, it remains to be seen if this capacity for gut microbial adaptation can keep up with stacking anthropogenic disturbances. "
"18","wild","While the gut microbiome is a key component in host health and likely plays a role in (wildlife) susceptibility to pathogens, the direct mechanisms driving the gut microbiome’s potential role in the transfer of zoonotic diseases to humans remains to be elucidated. "

"24","fitness","These shifts can be adaptive, indicating metagenomic plasticity, as well as maladaptive if they are associated with a decrease in beneficial functions, an increase in pathogens causing disease, or a decline in fitness10,16. "
"25","adaptation","While adaptation is most commonly associated with host genomics, the adaptive potential of the gut microbiome remains understudied10. "
"26","adaptation","Gut microbial maladaptation has been linked to a wide range of diseases (ref. 16 and references herein) and infections14,45 and may facilitate co-infections15. "
"27","adaptation","In conclusion, although our results suggest that the gut microbiome of the generalist spiny rat may possess the metagenomic plasticity to adapt to anthropogenic disturbances by shifting its gut microbial composition and functional potential, the increased variation and dispersion in gut microbial structure following the Anna Karenina Principle suggest that this adaptation may not be occurring fast enough. "
