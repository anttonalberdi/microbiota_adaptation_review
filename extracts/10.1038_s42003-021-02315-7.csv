"3","wild","Changes to wildlife gut microbiomes due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation, can disrupt natural gut microbiota homeostasis and make animals vulnerable to infections that may become zoonotic. "
"4","wild","However, it remains unclear whether the disruption to wildlife gut microbiomes is caused by habitat fragmentation per se or the combination of habitat fragmentation with additional anthropogenic disturbances, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and their pathogens. "
"5","wild","On the other hand, the greater variation in community structure and reduced alpha diversity may signal a decline in beneficial microbial functions and illustrate that gut adaption may not catch up with anthropogenic disturbances, even in a generalist species with large phenotypic plasticity, with potentially harmful consequences to both wildlife and human health. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02315-7 OPEN 1 Ulm University, Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Conservation Genomics, Ulm, Germany.

"
"7","wild","Human activities that may lead to such a disturbance are manifold and include habitat fragmentation and isolation, whose negative impacts on wildlife health can be amplified by additional factors, such as the presence of and contact with humans3,4, domesticated animals5,6, invasive species7, and pathogens7. "
"8","wild","Examining their ability to alter their gut microbial composition and its genes, known as metagenomic plasticity, when faced with human-driven environmental changes could help to understand the dynamics of emerging diseases from wildlife. "
"9","wild","In the Anthropocene, habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances threaten wildlife18. "
"10","wild","Their effects on the gut microbiome have been studied together19–22, but there is a gap in understanding if habitat fragmentation per se perturbs the gut microbiome or if the amplification by additional anthropogenic factors, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and pathogens poses a greater threat to wildlife gut microbial health. "
"11","wild","Considering its integral role in host health, such a loss could not only be detrimental to wildlife health, but could also promote microbial pathogens with zoonotic potential. "
"12","wild","This suggests that human disturbances at the landscape level can both shift gut microbial community structure and increase community dispersion in wildlife gut microbiomes, even in generalist species that are considered to be more resilient to environmental changes9. "
"13","wild","ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02315-7 4 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2021) 4:800 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02315-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio Discussion Faced with global change in the Anthropocene, wildlife all over the world has come under threat as humans advance further into wildlife habitats35,36. "
"14","wild","Of increasing interest in conservation biology is to understand the evolutionary responses of wildlife to human-driven selection pressures18. "
"15","wild","Our results show that the gut microbiomes of spiny rat individuals inhabiting fragmented landscapes with additional anthropogenic disturbance (such as contact to domesticated animals, invasive species, humans, and their pathogens) had lower alpha diversity and a shifted and more dispersed gut bacterial community composition, indicating that human disturbances at the landscape level can have both location and dispersion effects on the gut microbiomes of wildlife, even in generalist species that are considered to be more resilient to environmental changes9. "
"16","wild","Wildlife health and susceptibility to pathogens play important roles in the Anthropocene, as humans come into increasing contact with potentially maladaptive wildlife, which could lead to the transmission of zoonotic diseases. "
"17","wild","As human encroachment into wildlife habitats increases, it remains to be seen if this capacity for gut microbial adaptation can keep up with stacking anthropogenic disturbances. "
"18","wild","While the gut microbiome is a key component in host health and likely plays a role in (wildlife) susceptibility to pathogens, the direct mechanisms driving the gut microbiome’s potential role in the transfer of zoonotic diseases to humans remains to be elucidated. "

"24","fitness","These shifts can be adaptive, indicating metagenomic plasticity, as well as maladaptive if they are associated with a decrease in beneficial functions, an increase in pathogens causing disease, or a decline in fitness10,16. "
"25","adaptation","While adaptation is most commonly associated with host genomics, the adaptive potential of the gut microbiome remains understudied10. "
"26","adaptation","Gut microbial maladaptation has been linked to a wide range of diseases (ref. 16 and references herein) and infections14,45 and may facilitate co-infections15. "
"27","adaptation","In conclusion, although our results suggest that the gut microbiome of the generalist spiny rat may possess the metagenomic plasticity to adapt to anthropogenic disturbances by shifting its gut microbial composition and functional potential, the increased variation and dispersion in gut microbial structure following the Anna Karenina Principle suggest that this adaptation may not be occurring fast enough. "
"28","adaptation","As human encroachment into wildlife habitats increases, it remains to be seen if this capacity for gut microbial adaptation can keep up with stacking anthropogenic disturbances. "

"31","model","We used generalized linear mixed models, which allowed us to control for the lack of independence due to site-specific effects within landscapes and extraction batches. "
"32","model","Using model selection based on the information-theoretic (IT) approach24, we found very strong support for an effect of landscape on all three alpha diversity metrics: observed number of ASVs (ΔAICC= 19.63, R2GLMM(m)= 0.473, R2GLMM(c)= 0.579, Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 1); Shannon diversity, in which alpha diversity is weighted for abundance (ΔAICC= 5.84, R2GLMM(m)= 0.150, R2GLMM(c)= 0.171, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 2); and Faith’s PD, which controls for phylogenetic relatedness (ΔAICC= 6.05, R2GLMM(m)= 0.438, R2GLMM(c)= 0.480, Supplementary Fig. "
"33","model","The effects of field season and sex were poorly supported by AICC model comparison for any of the three alpha diversity metrics (Supplementary Data 1–3). "
"34","model","In addition, in all three alpha diversity models, spatial autocorrelation between capture sites was poorly supported by AICC model comparison (Supplementary Data 5) and, because models including this parameter were less parsimonious than their counterparts without the parameter, we opted against including this parameter in our final alpha diversity models. "
"35","model","However, because the ‘strata’ argument impacts p-values but not the calculation of AICC, we report results from both null hypothesis significance testing and IT model selection. "
"36","model","Again, using IT model selection, we found strong support for an effect of landscape type on compositional shifts in beta diversity with regards to both weighted (ΔAICC= 53.29, PCoA axis 1: Cohen’s dA-C= −1.053 (95% CI=−1.332 to −0.771), Cohen’s dA-I=−1.110 (95% CI=−1.375 to −0.841), Cohen’s dC-I=−0.030 (95% CI= −0.286 to 0.227); PCoA axis 2: Cohen’s dA-C=−0.904 (95% CI=−1.176 to −0.629), Cohen’s dA-I=−0.847 (95% CI= −1.100 to −0.593), Cohen’s dC-I= 0.109 (95% CI=−0.148 to 0.365); Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 6) and unweighted UniFrac distance metrics (ΔAICC= 21.74, PCoA axis 1: Cohen’s dA-C= −1.501 (95% CI=−1.805 to −1.193), Cohen’s dA-I=−1.501 (95% CI=−1.790 to −1.208), Cohen’s dC-I= 0.058 (95% CI= −0.198 to 0.314); PCoA axis 2: Cohen’s dA-C=−1.427 (95% CI=−1.428 to −0.857), Cohen’s dA-I=−0.684 (95% CI= −0.930 to −0.436), Cohen’s dC-I= 0.499 (95% CI= 0.233 to 0.763); Fig. 1d, Supplementary Data 7). "
"37","model","The effects of field season and sex for both PERMANOVA and PERMDISP2 analyses were poorly supported by AICC model comparison, regardless of the UniFrac metric used (Supplementary Data 7-10). "
"38","model","In addition, in all PERMDISP2 models, spatial autocorrelation between capture sites was poorly supported by AICC model comparison (Supplementary Data 12) and, because models including this parameter were less parsimonious than their counterparts without the parameter, we opted against including this parameter in our final PERMDISP2 models. "
"39","model","In addition, hemotrophic mycoplasma are known to infect dogs and cats53, while Odoribacter—isolated from the oral microbiomes of dogs and cats—causes periodontitis in infected animals54, and the family Erysipelotrichaceae has been linked to gut inflammation in mice models and metabolic disorders in hamster models55. "
"40","model","Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) from the lme4 package98 (version 1.1.21), we modeled alpha diversity according to landscape (landscape C, landscape I, and landscape A) and sequencing depth to account for differential sequencing effort between samples99. "
"41","model","To facilitate model convergence, sequencing depth was scaled. "
"42","model","We used a negative binomial error distribution when modeling the count data (observed ASVs) and a gamma distribution with a log link function when modeling the continuous data (Shannon diversity and Faith’s PD). "
"43","model","Model selection was based on the information-theoretic (IT) approach using a second order Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICC) as an information criterion and Akaike weights (ω) to determine model support24. "
"44","model","For all GLMMs, we report both conditional and marginal coefficients of determination of each model (R2GLMM(c), which explains the variance of both the fixed and random factors, and R2GLMM(m), which explains the variance of the fixed factors only)104, which we calculated as the variance explained by the best model, the ΔAICC, conditional parameter estimates (β), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using model averaging with a cumulative AICCω of 95%24. "
"45","model","In the main body of the article, we present back-transformed parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals for models with a log link function, while the log transformed versions of these values are presented in the Supplementary Data. "
"46","model","Finally, we tested for spatial autocorrelation between the capture sites using a spatial exponential covariance structure on the scaled capture site coordinates in each of the three alpha diversity models using the glmmTMB package105 (version 0.2.3). "
"47","model","The fixed variables in our full model were: landscape, sex, field season, extraction batch, and sequencing depth. "
"48","model","We retained extraction batch in our full model to statistically account for its model support (Supplementary Data 6 and 7). "
"49","model","We then passed every possible combination of our full model through the adonis function to generate a model selection table sorted according to AICC values (as described above), which we calculated using the AICC equation24 with input values from the ‘residuals’ and ‘sum of squares’ output of the adonis function. "
"50","model","We report coefficients of determination of each model (R2). "
"51","model","In addition to building a model selection table sorted according to AICC values, we also subjected this PERMANOVA test to null hypothesis significance testing with 9999 permutations and present p-values, F-values, and R2. "
"52","model","We then modeled the distances to the centroids using GLMMs from the lme4 package98 with a gamma distribution and log link function for continuous data. "
"53","model","The explanatory variables and random factor variables were the same as described above for the alpha diversity metrics, as was the model selection process and the testing for spatial autocorrelation between the capture sites. "
"54","model","However, controlling for host density did not quantitatively change our results (compare Supplementary Data 1-4 and 6-11 to Supplementary Data 13-22) and, in order to not overparameterize our models, we chose to exclude this variable in our final analysis, though we present the results in the Supplementary Information. "
"55","model","We also extracted model parameter estimates and standard errors in order to show which ASVs were more or less abundant in each landscape type. "
