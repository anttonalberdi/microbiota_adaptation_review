"2","wild","Subsequent analysis revealed these bacterial read sets to represent distinct communities of bacterial species, which is suggestive of an interaction between ranavirus and the host microbiome in the wild. "
"3","wild","As extrapolation of findings from laboratory studies to wild systems is often tenuous, to fully appreciate the true impacts of ranaviral infection we need to understand its impact on the transcript-level response of wild animals (Alvarez et al., 2015). "
"4","wild","The subsequent formation of the Frog Mortality Project (FMP) led to unprecedented public engagement in the study of a wildlife disease (see Price, Garner, Cunningham, Langton, & Nichols, 2016) and the formation of a unique database of frog populations known to have a positive history of ranaviral disease. "
"5","wild","In this study, we combine this controlled field system with a novel approach to the filtering of RNA-Seq read data collected from wild animals to investigate the impact of ranaviral disease history on the transcriptome of wild populations of R. temporaria in the UK. "
"6","wild","4.3 | Novel approach to wildlife transcriptomics Harnessing the potential of RNA-Seq to examine the mRNA transcript profiles of wild animals requires that contamination be minimized. "
"7","wild","However, traditional approaches to the removal of contaminant read data, consisting of limited alignment protocols against the genomes of humans and Escherichia coli bacteria (e.g., Yang, Qi, Bi, Fu, & Access, 2012), rarely encompass the possible range of contaminants of a wild-derived RNA sample. "
"8","wild","Our adoption of RNA-Seq read-filtering techniques previously utilized in clinical genomics studies (e.g., Burk et al., 2017; Jeraldo et al., 2015, 2016; Strong et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2016) has allowed us to overcome the challenge of contamination in wild-collected samples, facilitating the identification and separation of potential contaminant reads from those of the organism of interest. "
"9","wild","However, ranaviruses have previously been shown to coinfect with several other micro-organisms in both wild (Landsberg et al., 2013; Warne, La Bumbard, La Grange, Vredenburg, & Catenazzi, 2016; Whitfield et al., 2013) and captive amphibian populations (Miller et al., 2008). "
"10","wild","Although incidental, our findings suggest that a relationship may also exist between the skin microbial communities of R. temporaria and ranaviruses in the wild. "
"11","wild","As our finding relies on tissue samples of a small number of individuals, a more comprehensive study of the interaction between ranaviruses and the structure of amphibian microbiomes in the wild would prove valuable. "

"66","disease","4 | DISCUSSION 4.1 | Differential expression Although there was no obvious clustering of expression profiles between our six sampled populations across the whole of our transcriptome, we identified a relatively small suite of 407 transcripts, both upand down-regulated, that showed strong clustering within disease history classes. "
"67","disease","The highest fold change of any gene up-regulated in positive disease history populations was associated with ATP-binding cassette transporter 10, which has been shown to be essential to the formation of haeme in mice (Yamamoto et al., 2014). "

"
"75","disease","Expression of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), Preprofallaxidin-7, was also down-regulated in positive disease history populations. "
"76","disease","This change in expression of an AMP may therefore be contributory to the potential differences in the skin microbial communities of frogs based of ranaviral disease history that we present herein. "
"77","disease","We found three genes related to the development of the nervous (Oligophrenin-1 and Fam114a1) and muscular systems (Dystrophin) to be down-regulated in positive disease history populations. "
"78","disease","Although a decrease in transcript numbers related to organismal development may suggest reduced developmental rate, it should be noted that the animals sampled for this study were breeding adults; so while this is plausible, it is also possible that the individuals sampled from positive history populations were on average older and more developmentally advanced that those collected in disease-free populations. "
"79","disease","The importance of each of the genes discussed above in relation to ranaviral disease history remains to be verified. "
"80","disease","4.1.3 | No evidence of a coherent transcript response Potentially important genes appear to be both upand down-regulated in positive disease history populations. "
"81","disease","This fact, coupled with a lack of significant enrichment in any particular functional pathways, suggest that changes in transcript profile observed in R. temporaria populations with a positive disease history of ranavirus may not be beneficial in terms of combating ranaviral infection. "
"82","disease","This may explain the relatively low number of differentially expressed transcripts when compared to disease-challenged amphibians of other species and of R. temporaria itself to other pathogens (Cotter, Storfer, Page, Beachy, & Voss, 2008; Ellison et al., 2015; Price et al., 2015). "
"83","disease","However, R. temporaria experimentally exposed to ranavirus by Price et al. (2015) showed almost no response at the transcript level suggesting that a potentially weak transcript response to even acute ranaviral infection may be a true reflection of the immune capabilities of R. temporaria and thus contributory to their high susceptibility to disease. "
"84","disease","Differential expression of noncoding RNAs has been reported in response to viral infections in several species (Chicken, Ahanda et al., 2009; Mice, Peng, Gralinski, Armour, & Ferris, 2010; Humans, Yin et al., 2013), but their expression in amphibian disease responses is unevaluated. "
"85","disease","This result suggests that lncRNA may form a large proportion of the differentially expressed transcripts between populations of varying ranaviral disease history. "
"86","disease","In the present study, we found that read sets from populations with a positive history of ranaviral infection contained significantly more bacterial reads than those from disease-free populations. "
"87","disease","The detectable bacterial species diversity in samples from positive disease history populations was significantly lower than disease-free populations, with commensal communities of frogs from positive disease history populations being dominated by a single species, Bacillus subtilis. "
"88","disease","The bacterial community composition between the populations of different disease history was also shown to be distinct (Figure 3). "
"89","disease","When distances between each population’s microbial community structure were computed based on presence/absence data, rather than species abundance counts, we found high similarity between disease-free populations but more divergence between the microbial communities of positive disease history populations (Figure 3). "
"90","disease","This suggests that between disease-free and positive disease history populations, both the species assemblages and the abundance of represented bacterial species vary but that similarities between the microbial communities from positive disease history samples are primarily driven by the sheer abundance of the most dominant detectable taxa (i.e., Bacillus subtilis). "
"91","disease","In total, five bacterial OTUs were identified as differentially abundant between disease history groups. "
"92","disease","Bacillus subtilis was found to be two orders of magnitude more abundant in positive history vs. disease-free populations. "
"93","disease","A well-known probiotic, B. subtilis has been shown to increase immune function of fish and reduce the impact of infectious diseases in aquaculture (Aly, Abdel-Galil Ahmed, Abdel-Aziz Ghareeb, & Mohamed, 2008; Liu, Chiu, Wang, & Cheng, 2012; Ran et al., 2012). "
"94","disease","This presents the possibility that the huge overabundance (compared to disease-free populations) of this potentially beneficial bacterium could represent an adaptive change in host microbiome that may infer greater resistance to ranaviral disease. "
"95","disease","An alternative explanation is therefore that these relatively more abundant bacterial species are exploiting the potentially immune-compromised hosts from populations with a positive history of ranaviral disease to establish themselves at higher levels on amphibian skin. "
"96","disease","In fact, the structure of amphibian microbial communities has been shown to be an effective predictor of disease risk associated with Bd (Becker et al., 2015; Jani, Knapp, & Briggs, 2017; Woodhams et al., 2014), and it is postulated that the relative immunity of R. temporaria to Bd infection may be due to the microbiota present on their skin (Woodhams et al., 2014). "
"97","disease","With no knowledge of the structure of the amphibian skin microbiomes at positive disease history populations prior to disease outbreak, it is not possible to know whether potential changes in the microbiome structure are a cause or consequence of disease history. "
"98","disease","For example, it may not be that B. subtilis is necessarily two orders of magnitude more abundant in positive disease history populations but that the B. subtilis that are present are expressing a portion of their genome at a level two orders of magnitude higher than in diseasefree populations. "
"99","disease","Given the perfect correlation between positive ranaviral disease history and high abundance of B. subtilis, we have no way of concluding whether the transcript changes discussed previously are due to a positive history of acute ranaviral infection or to the abundance or transcriptional activity of B. subtilis, and further experimental work is warranted to this end. "
"100","disease","Additionally, investigations of the interaction between ranaviruses and B. subtilis both in vivo and in vitro might prove important as understanding potentially inhibitory interactions between commensal bacteria and ranaviruses may lead to innovative use of probiotics in disease mitigation strategies, similar to those already observed in response to Bd (e.g., Woodhams et al., 2014) or in aquaculture (e.g., Aly et al., 2008). "
"101","disease","Finally, although none of the animals sampled for this study were symptomatic of ranaviral infection, we found that sample pools from both positive disease history and disease-free populations contained similar numbers of reads that mapped to the genome of FV3. "
"102","disease","The population monitoring of our field site owners has previously been verified by diagnostic sampling of R. temporaria collected from most of the populations which were sampled for this study (Teacher et al., 2010); therefore, we have no reason to doubt the disease history classification of each population. "
"103","disease","Due to the possible detection of transient microbial diversity from the environment, this result may suggest that ranaviruses are present even at those populations where acute disease has not been observed. "
"104","disease","This may mean that ranaviruses are more ubiquitous than currently thought and that other factors dictate whether disease occurs within a given population. "
"105","disease","The use of new environmental DNA sampling techniques (i.e., Hall, Crespi, Goldberg, & Brunner, 2016) will make it possible to explore how universally distributed ranavirus virions are compared to incidences of known disease outbreak and to investigate potential relationships between species diversity within an environment (microbial and otherwise) and the occurrence of ranaviral disease. "

"138","laboratory","As extrapolation of findings from laboratory studies to wild systems is often tenuous, to fully appreciate the true impacts of ranaviral infection we need to understand its impact on the transcript-level response of wild animals (Alvarez et al., 2015). "
"139","laboratory","Infection with Bd has been shown to alter the structure of the commensal bacterial communities on amphibian skin (Jani & Briggs, 2014; Woodhams et al., 2014), and several species of bacteria isolated from amphibian skin have been shown to inhibit Bd in the laboratory (Antwis, Preziosi, Harrison, & Garner, 2015; Park, Park, Collingwood, St-hilaire, & Sheridan, 2014).
