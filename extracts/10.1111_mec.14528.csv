"1","wild","OR I G I N A L A R T I C L E A novel approach to wildlife transcriptomics provides evidence of disease-mediated differential expression and changes to the microbiome of amphibian populations Lewis J. "
"2","wild","Subsequent analysis revealed these bacterial read sets to represent distinct communities of bacterial species, which is suggestive of an interaction between ranavirus and the host microbiome in the wild. "
"3","wild","As extrapolation of findings from laboratory studies to wild systems is often tenuous, to fully appreciate the true impacts of ranaviral infection we need to understand its impact on the transcript-level response of wild animals (Alvarez et al., 2015). "
"4","wild","The subsequent formation of the Frog Mortality Project (FMP) led to unprecedented public engagement in the study of a wildlife disease (see Price, Garner, Cunningham, Langton, & Nichols, 2016) and the formation of a unique database of frog populations known to have a positive history of ranaviral disease. "
"5","wild","In this study, we combine this controlled field system with a novel approach to the filtering of RNA-Seq read data collected from wild animals to investigate the impact of ranaviral disease history on the transcriptome of wild populations of R. temporaria in the UK. "
"6","wild","4.3 | Novel approach to wildlife transcriptomics Harnessing the potential of RNA-Seq to examine the mRNA transcript profiles of wild animals requires that contamination be minimized. "
"7","wild","However, traditional approaches to the removal of contaminant read data, consisting of limited alignment protocols against the genomes of humans and Escherichia coli bacteria (e.g., Yang, Qi, Bi, Fu, & Access, 2012), rarely encompass the possible range of contaminants of a wild-derived RNA sample. "
"8","wild","Our adoption of RNA-Seq read-filtering techniques previously utilized in clinical genomics studies (e.g., Burk et al., 2017; Jeraldo et al., 2015, 2016; Strong et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2016) has allowed us to overcome the challenge of contamination in wild-collected samples, facilitating the identification and separation of potential contaminant reads from those of the organism of interest. "
"9","wild","However, ranaviruses have previously been shown to coinfect with several other micro-organisms in both wild (Landsberg et al., 2013; Warne, La Bumbard, La Grange, Vredenburg, & Catenazzi, 2016; Whitfield et al., 2013) and captive amphibian populations (Miller et al., 2008). "
"10","wild","Although incidental, our findings suggest that a relationship may also exist between the skin microbial communities of R. temporaria and ranaviruses in the wild. "
"11","wild","As our finding relies on tissue samples of a small number of individuals, a more comprehensive study of the interaction between ranaviruses and the structure of amphibian microbiomes in the wild would prove valuable. "
"12","wild","5 | CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Our results suggest that a disease history of ranavirus may alter the gene expression profile of wild R. temporaria populations but that such changes may not be associated with heightened ability to cope with the presence of a ranavirus. "
"13","wild","The incorporation of a novel read-filtering technique has provided us with evidence of a relationship between ranaviruses and the bacterial communities inhabiting amphibian skin in the wild. "
