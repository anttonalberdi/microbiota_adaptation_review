"1","wild","Ageand sex-matched C57BL/6 IL-10 / and wild type mice were transferred from a germ-free environment to a specific pathogen free condition. "
"2","wild","Animal and experimental design Ageand sex-matched C57BL/6 IL-10 / and wild type mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and maintained in a GF animal facility at the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). "
"3","model","1, 2] Recent evidence from bench research including genetics, immunology, microbiology, experimental animal models and clinical studies, demonstrate the abnormal host-microbial interactions in the pathogenesis of IBD.["
"4","model","6] Studies of experimental models have shown that the intestinal microbiota play an important role in the development of chronic intestinal inflammation.["
"5","model","Therefore, our study confirm the important role played by the commensal flora in triggering and exacerbating chronic intestinal inflammation in this IBD animal model. "
"6","model","12 To further explore the role of miR-155/SHIP pathway in IL-10 / mice with commensal bacteria induced colitis, we observed the effects of miR-155 inhibition on this animal model. "
"7","model","Both histological score and the cytokines secretion were decreased in mice receiving anti-miR-155 treatment, suggestingthe acceptable therapeutic effects of anti-miR155 in this IBD model. "
"8","model","The immunology of mucosal models of inflammation. "
