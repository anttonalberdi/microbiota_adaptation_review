"
"11","disease","INTRODUCTION Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing the chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is thought to result from an aberrant immune response to intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals.["
"12","disease","4] In addition to pathogenic microbes, otherwise harmless commensal microbes can also trigger the inflammatory diseases of the intestine such as IBD in some distinct circumstance,[5] which might be explained by the concept that intestinal inflammation of intestine may arise from lack of tolerance to antigens present in autologous microflora in genetically susceptible host.["
"13","disease","35] Colonic samples were collected from CD patients with active colitis (Crohn's disease activity index > 150) who were not exposure to steroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents during the recent 30 days. "
"14","disease","We also evaluated the relationship between IL-10, miR155, SHIP-1 and disease activity which was indicated as CDAI. "
"15","disease","43, 44] This is confirmed by a study indicating that recurrent disease is found after reinfusion of luminal contents in patients with fecal diversion.["

"35","environment","IL-10/miR-155/SHIP-1 signaling pathway was activated in IL-10 / mice transferring from a germ-free environment to a specific pathogen free condition. "
"36","environment","31] The goals of the current study was to characterize the changes induced by commensal bacteria in the IL-10/miR-155/SHIP-1 signaling pathway, as well as the potential therapeutic effects of anti-miR-155 on colitis in IL-10 / mice shifted from GF to specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment. "
"37","environment","Additionally, significant difference in the SHIP-1 level was found between IL-10 / mice in SPF conditions and those in GF environments (Figure 1B). "
"38","environment","26, 28, 30] The present study showed a development of colitis and activated miR-155 signaling pathway in animals shifted from GF to a SPF environment. "
