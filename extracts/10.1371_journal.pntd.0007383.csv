"2","wild","Here we characterized the microbiota in T. infestans feces of both wild-caught and laboratory-reared insects and examined the relationship between microbial composition and T. cruzi infection using highly sensitive high-throughput sequencing technology to sequence the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene on the MiSeq Illumina platform. "

"7","wild","(2019) Hindgut microbiota in laboratory-reared and wild Triatoma infestans. "
"8","wild","Our findings suggest that T. cruzi infection is associated with the microbiota of T. infestans and that inferring the microbiota of wild T. infestans may not be possible through sampling of T. infestans reared in the insectary. "
"9","wild","Our study is the first to use sensitive high-throughput methods to study the gut microbes of T. infestans, using both laboratoryreared and wild insects. "
"10","wild","We have found that the microbial composition of T. infestans in the laboratory does not reflect the complete collection of gut microbes of wild T. infestans and inferring the gut microbiota profile of wild insects through studying lab insects alone may not be possible. "
"11","wild","We also found evidence that in wild insects T. cruzi affects the composition of the gut microbiota and identified some bacterial taxa which may be important in modulating the T.infestans-T.cruzi relationship. "
"12","wild","In the wild, acquisition of non-symbiotic/environmental or host-associated microbes can also occur through coprophagy and during bloodmeals when in contact with the mammalian host [19]. "
"13","wild","Microbiota of wild insects has also been found to differ from laboratory insects [17, 20, 23, 24, 26–30]. "
"14","wild","To our knowledge, there have been no examinations of the microbiome of wild Triatoma infestans by high-throughput sequencing, and there is only one study examining eight labreared T. infestans [25]. "
"15","wild","Using deep sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene at the variable V3-V4 locus we characterized the microbiome of 59 wild-caught and 10 laboratory-reared T. infestans from endemic communities in Arequipa, Perú. "
"16","wild","The objective of our study was to identify and compare the hindgut microbial composition of lab-reared and wild T. infestans and of T. cruzi-infected and uninfected insects and explore correlations between T. cruzi infection and specific microbiota profiles. "
"17","wild","Microbial composition analyses Diversity estimates (α-diversity, within-group, and β-diversity, between group) were calculated with respect to origin (wild-caught vs. laboratory-reared T. infestans), T. cruzi infection, stage, and temporal and spatial factors. "
"18","wild","Results Insect collection and T. cruzi qPCR Fecal specimens from 69 T. infestans (59 wild-caught and 10 laboratory-reared) were used in this study. "
"19","wild","Nine of the 59 wild bugs (15.3%) and 4 of the 10 laboratory bugs (40.0%) were T. cruzi-infected, confirmed by both microscopy of fresh fecal samples and qRT-PCR. "
"20","wild","Approximately half of the wild insects (32, 54.2%) were collected in the urban district of Alto Selva Alegre, but the majority of infected wild insects were captured in the rural district of Murco (5/9, 55.6%). "
"21","wild","Of 59 wild insects, 29 were adults (49.2%), 17 (28.8%) were fifth instars, 7 (11.9%) were fourth instars and the remainder 6 insects (10.2%) were third instars. "
"22","wild","Six of the 9 infected wild triatomines were fifth instars and the other 3 were adults. "
"23","wild","No wild infected third and fourth instars were sampled. "
"24","wild","Only two samples belonging to wild insects had<1000 sequences and for many of the downstream analyses affected by sample depth, these two samples were excluded. "
"25","wild","The other samples of wild insects all had>2000 sequences. "
"26","wild","The genus-level bacterial composition of all lab insects (n = 10) and all wild (n = 59) is shown in Fig 1A and 1B, respectively. "
"27","wild","Microbiota comparison of laboratory-reared vs. wild T. infestans We first compared the αand β-diversities of 2013 and 2015 laboratory-reared insects to confirm the validity of combining the data of these insects. "
"28","wild","Bacterial genera and their relative abundance in the fecal microbiota of laboratory-reared T. infestans (A) and wildcaught T. infestans (B). "
"29","wild","Of 124 genera identified in wild insects, 96 were also found in the lab-reared T. infestans. "
"30","wild","A total of 124 genera were identified for all wild T. infestans. "
"31","wild","The 22 genera listed comprised 84.5% of the overall microbiome of wild insects with individual relative abundances ranging from 1.1–17.6% of all 16S sequences in wild insects. "
"32","wild","The population-level relative abundance of these genera (calculated as the sequence counts assigned to that genera/total sequence counts in all wild insects x 100) is given. "
"33","wild","The remaining genera, which each made up<1% of all 16S sequences from wild insects, are listed as “Other genera” in the legend. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007383.g001 Microbiome of Triatoma infestans by deep sequencing PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007383 May 6, 2019 8 / 26 and 2015 insects did not differ significantly when comparing α-diversity with number of observed taxa as the metric (p = 0.430) and β-diversity (weighted Unifrac, ANOSIM R = -0.079, p = 0.605) (S1 Fig). "
"34","wild","Next, we compared the microbial composition between wild-caught and laboratory-reared T. infestans. "
"35","wild","All of the bacterial taxa identified in the complete dataset were seen in the wildcaught insects. "
"36","wild","The microbiomes of laboratory-reared T. infestans were a subset of the wildcaught T. infestans microbiota (S2 Fig) and included 56 of the total 70 bacterial families (80.0%, S3 Table) and 96 of the total 124 genera identified (77.4%, S3 Table). "
"37","wild","The 28 genera absent from the lab-reared insects included both rare taxa in the wild insect population (present in only 2–5 of the 59 wild insects) and common taxa (present in up to 40/59 wild insects) (S3 Table) and represented mainly soil-associated bacteria [48]. "
"38","wild","By rarefaction analyses of number of observed taxa (Fig 2A and 2B), the α-diversity of laboratory-reared T. infestans was significantly lower than that of wild-caught T. infestans (p = 0.001) at increasing rarefaction depths (2000, 5000 and 10000 sequences, S3 Fig) and by the additional metrics Chao1 and Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (S4 Fig). "
"39","wild","The greater α-diversity in wild compared to lab insects was evident when inspecting the taxa plots (Fig 1), as only three genera dominated the microbiomes of the lab-reared insects: 97.4% of the overall microbiome of lab-reared insects was composed of Enterococcus (58.7%), an unclassified Enterobacteriaceae genus (36.7%), and Bacillus (2.0%) (Fig 1A), with the remaining 2.6% of sequences assigned to the other 93 genera. "
"40","wild","The high prevalence of this unclassified Enterobacteriaceae genus is notable since it was present in only 0.25% of all 16S sequences of wild T. infestans (S3 Table), the largest difference in relative abundances observed between wild and lab insects. "
"41","wild","In contrast to lab insects which were dominated by only three genera only overall, 22 genera were found to be responsible for 84.5% of the overall microbiome among all wild insects (relative abundances among all sequences of wild insects ranging = 1.1–17.6%, Fig 1B); the remaining 14.5% of wild insect sequences were assigned to the other 102 genera observed. "
"42","wild","Enterococcus and Bacillus, which had high relative abundances in lab insects, were among the 22 genera in wild insects, present in 5.7% and 3.7% of all 16S sequences of wild insects, respectively (Fig 1B, S3 Table). "
"43","wild","17.29% of all 16S sequences from wild insects were Actinomycetales compared to only 0.18% of all lab insect 16S sequences. "
"44","wild","We identified Wolbachia in 51/59 (86.4%) of wild T. infestans (9/9 T. cruzi-infected and 42/50 uninfected) and in 8/10 (80.0%) of lab insects (4/4 T. cruzi-infected and 4/6 uninfected) (S3 Table). "
"45","wild","In our samples, however, Wolbachia was present at very low within-insect frequencies which averaged 0.06% in wild T. infestans and 0.02% in lab T. infestans, and they did not change with respect to T. cruzi-infection. "
"46","wild","Differences between wild and lab insects’ microbiota were also reflected in β-diversity analyses, with statistically significant ANOSIM tests and clear separation on PCoA between the Microbiome of Triatoma infestans by deep sequencing PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007383 May 6, 2019 9 / 26 Fig 2. αand β-diversity of laboratory-reared and wild-caught T. infestans. "
"47","wild","Lab insects are shown in orange and wild insects are shown in green. "
"48","wild","The number of observed taxa for lab and wild insects was then compared by averaging the iterations of rarefactions within sample groups and using non-parametric two-sample t-tests with 1000 Monte Carlo permutations to calculate the p-value (Panel B). "
"49","wild","The origin of insect collection (lab or wild) was significantly associated with the number of taxa identified (p< 0.001). "
"50","wild","The weighted Unifrac variation patterns indicate differences between the bacterial microbiota of lab vs. wild insect, as samples from the two groups cluster separately. "
"51","wild","This was formally supported by non-parametric permutation ANOSIM test which found significant β-diversity clustering between the lab and wild insects with 1000 permutations (R = 0.424, p = 0.001). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007383.g002 Microbiome of Triatoma infestans by deep sequencing PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007383 May 6, 2019 10 / 26 wild and lab insect microbiomes by three different methods: weighted Unifrac ANOSIM R = 0.424, p = 0.001 (Fig 2B); Bray-Curtis ANOSIM R = 0.796, p = 0.001 (S3C Fig); and unweighted Unifrac ANOSIM R = 0.593, p = 0.001 (S3D Fig). "
"52","wild","In addition, analysis of differences in relative abundances by DESeq2 showed that almost half of the microbiome common to both wild and lab insects (44.8%, 43/96 genera) was differentially abundant (S5 Fig). "
"53","wild","Month and location of collection are not associated with microbiome composition in wild uninfected T. infestans To investigate factors influencing microbiome variation among wild uninfected T. infestans, we explored the effect of time of collection (month of the year) and of place of collection (Arequipa districts) on the microbial composition by independently analyzing uninfected T. infestans collected from the Alta Selva Alegre (A.S.A) district only (n = 30) from November 2011 to May 2012 and uninfected T. infestans collected in March 2012 from three different districts (Yura n = 2, Hunter n = 7, and A.S.A n = 7). "
"54","wild","Similarly, when time of collection was restricted to a single month, district of collection had minimal effect on microbial diversity of wild uninfected T. infestans from Yura, Hunter, and A.S.A districts, both in αdiversity (number of observed taxa, range p for all pairwise comparisons = 0.960–1.000) and βdiversity analysis (ANOSIM R = 0.019, p = 0.348, S7 Fig). "
"55","wild","Developmental stage is not associated with microbiome composition in wild T. infestans The microbial composition across developmental stage (S8 Fig, Panel A) was not associated with α-diversity (observed number of taxa, p = 1.000 among all comparisons, S8 Fig Panels B and C) or β-diversity associated with developmental stage (weighted Unifrac ANOSIM R = -0.042, p = 0.767, S8 Fig Panel D). "
"56","wild","T. cruzi is associated with variation in the microbiota of wild T. infestans, but not with that of lab-reared T. infestans We examined whether T. cruzi infection is associated with the microbiota composition of labreared and wild-caught T. infestans. "
"57","wild","Four of the 10 lab insects and 9 of the 59 wild-caught T. infestans were T. cruzi-infected. "
"58","wild","T. cruzi infection did not affect α-diversity of either lab or wild insects by any metric (number of observed taxa Fig 3; Chao1 and Faith’s PD, S9A–S9D Fig). "
"59","wild","In wild insects, on the other hand, T. cruzi infection was associated with variation in β-diversity by weighted Unifrac analysis (ANOSIM R = 0.269; p = 0.011, Fig 4B) as well as unweighted Unifrac (R = 0.215, p = 0.012, S11 Fig) and Bray-Curtis methods (R = 0.250, p = 0.012, S11 Fig).

"70","wild","Our work describes, for the first time, the hindgut microbiota of T. infestans with sensitive high-throughput approaches in both laboratory-reared and wild-caught T. infestans and investigates the relationship between T. cruzi infection and microbiota profiles. "
"71","wild","We observed that Enterobacteriales and Bacillales, previously shown to dominate the microbiota of Rhodnius prolixus [28] and T. dimidiata [20], respectively, but not T. infestans [25], occurred at high relative abundances in both our lab (Enterobacteriales, 37.0%; Bacillales 2.5%) and wild insect populations (Enterobacteriales, 7.6%; Bacillales 9.0%). "
"72","wild","Some genera which have been previously identified as important members of the microbial communities of triatomines, including of T. infestans, were absent from our insects (Arsenophonus), observed in the majority of both lab and wild bugs but at low relative abundance (Rhodococcus and Corynebacterium), or found at high relative abundance in only a few wild T. cruzi-uninfected samples (Mycobacterium, Williamsia, Serratia). "
"73","wild","T. cruzi infection in T. overrepresented in infected wild insects compared to uninfected wild insects, and those below the line (negative differences in relative abundance) depict taxa which were underrepresented in infected insects compared to uninfected insects. "
"74","wild","Ten genera were identified to have statistically significant differences in their relative abundance between infected and uninfected wild insects (p<0.01) and their points are colored red. "
"75","wild","DESeq2 analysis identified 10 bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant between T. cruzi-infected and uninfected wild insects. "
"76","wild","Bars above the line (positive differences in relative abundance) depict taxa which were overrepresented in infected wild insects compared to uninfected wild insects, and those below the line (negative differences in relative abundance) depict taxa which were underrepresented in infected insects compared to uninfected insects. "
"77","wild","Finally, the Wolbachia genus was detected in the majority of our wild and labreared triatomines but at low overall relative abundance (0.05% of all 16S sequences from wild insects and 0.02% of all 16S sequences from lab insects). "
"78","wild","Whilst we cannot establish based on our data that Wolbachia spp. are true symbionts of T. infestans, the fact that we observe this genus in 51/59 of wild insects and 8/10 of lab insects is indicative of symbiosis. "
"79","wild","Further efforts are needed to better understand whether Wolbachia and the other bacteria we found in the majority of both our lab and wild bugs, but at low relative abundance in the hindgut, are rare microbes or present at higher densities in other intestinal segments and what functional role, if any, they may play in the T. infestans lifecyle and T. cruzi infection. "
"80","wild","Microbiota varied substantially between our lab and wild insects, particularly with respect to environmental species and Actinomycetes. "
"81","wild","As in previous studies [23, 24] we observed that the overall diversity of lab T. infestans was reduced compared to wild T. infestans. "
"82","wild","The missing microbes in lab vs. wild insects pertained primarily to soil-associated bacteria (such as Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales). "
"83","wild","Even among the 96 genera which were common to both lab and wild bugs, we found significant differences: only three genera (Enterococcus, an unidentified genus of Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacillus) dominated the lab insects, whereas 22 distinct genera dominated the overall microbiota of the wild T. infestans. "
"84","wild","Whilst we detected Actinomycetes in all lab and all wild insects we sampled, their overall diversity and relative abundance was significantly reduced in lab vs. wild insects: 17.3% of all 16S sequences from wild insects were Actinomycetales (representing 30 distinct genera) compared to only 0.18% of all lab insect 16S sequences (representing 22 distinct genera). "
"85","wild","This suggests that environmentally-acquired microbes by the wild insects while off-host/ host-seeking is an important source of these differences. "
"86","wild","These differences reflect the overall decreased diversity of laboratory-reared triatomines and highlight that the microbiome of insectary-reared T. infestans may not represent that of wild populations, even in the same geographic area. "
"87","wild","The effect of environmentally-acquired bacteria and Actinomycetes symbionts on T. cruzi infection of wild T. infestans is not well characterized. "
"88","wild","First, we found differences between T. cruzi-infected and uninfected wild insects and 8/10 genera differentially abundant between infected and uninfected bugs were environmental microbes, primarily found in soil, or Actinomycetes (Bosea, Mesorhizobium, Dietzia, and Cupriavidus were underrepresented in infected bugs; Sporosarcina, Nestenrenkonia, Alkalibacterium, Marinilactibacillus were overrepresented in infected bugs). "
"89","wild","Little is known about the relevance of the 10 different genera which differed significantly in their relative abundance between infected and uninfected wild bugs to T. infestans or T. cruzi. "
"90","wild","In our sample, the Dietzia genus was underrepresented in infected vs. uninfected wild triatomines. "
"91","wild","We did not find that α-diversity differed by infection status in either lab or wild bugs. "
"92","wild","Although we found associations between microbiota and T. cruzi infection in wild insects and found Dietzia to be a potentially important taxon to T. cruzi infection, we cannot infer the directionality of these relationships. "
"93","wild","However, since regular meals cannot always be guaranteed in the wild, interactions between triatomines’ intestinal environment and T. cruzi may be quite different. "
"94","wild","We lacked data of potentially important variables in wild-caught insects, such as length of time since last feeding, blood meal source and duration of T. cruzi infection to assess these interactions in our wild bug population. "
"95","wild","We found significant microbiome variation among individual wild insects. "
"96","wild","Whilst our findings are in line with a previous report of wild-caught T. protracta that geography does not explain microbiome variability [27], our collections were spatially limited in relation to the T. infestans geographic range and our low sample sizes for some districts may have had limited power for spatial analyses. "
"97","wild","Thus, studies of the microbial structure of wild triatomines across a wider geographic area are needed. "
"98","wild","Finally, a systematic temporal collection of wild triatomines was hindered by low infestation and infection rates at the time in Arequipa and seasonality should not be discounted as an important factor influencing the microbiota of triatomines. "
"99","wild","To enable a better understanding of the real significance of T. cruzi on its vectors, such studies of wild triatomines would need to include not only microbiome surveys (including specimens from multiple species, developmental stages and geographic locations), but also metagenomic studies, similar to the study conducted by Carels et al. (2017) on labreared triatomines which identified major metabolic pathways of gut microbes [67]. "
"100","wild","Additionally, the field will need insectary-based studies of triatomine microbiome before and after T. cruzi infection to identify any pre-existing bacterial species that are protective, necessary, or encouraging to infection, with the caveat that there Microbiome of Triatoma infestans by deep sequencing PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007383 May 6, 2019 18 / 26 are large differences between laboratory-reared and wild bugs’ intestinal flora.

"161","environment","To further reduce the likelihood of contamination from the laboratory environment, we used UV-irradiated plasticware and reagents (with the exception of the Taq polymerase). "
"162","environment","Microbiota varied substantially between our lab and wild insects, particularly with respect to environmental species and Actinomycetes. "
"163","environment","This suggests that environmentally-acquired microbes by the wild insects while off-host/ host-seeking is an important source of these differences. "
"164","environment","The effect of environmentally-acquired bacteria and Actinomycetes symbionts on T. cruzi infection of wild T. infestans is not well characterized. "
"165","environment","In addition, it has been postulated that acquisition of important Actinomycetes symbionts is in fact dependent on the environment [64], because of coprophagy from soil contaminated with feces [16]. "
"166","environment","Numerous examples of the relevance of environmentally-acquired extracellular microbes to other insects’ fitness exist (reviewed here [65]). "
"167","environment","For instance, it has been demonstrated that lab-hatched Ixodes scapularis ticks lacking the environmentally-acquired microbes carried a larger proportion of human pathogenic Rickettsia spp. than field-caught ticks, indicating that environmentally-acquired symbionts outcompete Rickettsia [66]. "
"168","environment","Our data suggest that environmentally-acquired species and/or Actinomycetes may be important to T. cruzi infections because of two observations. "
"169","environment","First, we found differences between T. cruzi-infected and uninfected wild insects and 8/10 genera differentially abundant between infected and uninfected bugs were environmental microbes, primarily found in soil, or Actinomycetes (Bosea, Mesorhizobium, Dietzia, and Cupriavidus were underrepresented in infected bugs; Sporosarcina, Nestenrenkonia, Alkalibacterium, Marinilactibacillus were overrepresented in infected bugs). "
"170","environment","Second, the microbiome structure of our lab insects which were deficient in both environmental species and Actinomycetes was not associated with T. cruzi infection. "
"171","environment","Like our study, previous studies of triatomine microbiomes and their relationship to T. cruzi infection have also found differences between infected and uninfected bugs, but these findings do not always agree: Castro et al. [73] reported that resident microbiota of R. prolixus may create a hostile environment for the parasite, as pre-treatment with antibiotics in the blood meal increased T. cruzi infectivity ten-fold; however, in vitro assays suggested that the parasites inhibited bacterial growth as well [73]. "
"172","environment","However, since regular meals cannot always be guaranteed in the wild, interactions between triatomines’ intestinal environment and T. cruzi may be quite different. "

"181","human","The most important method of T. cruzi transmission to humans is vector-borne: T. cruzi undergoes development exclusively in the gut of hematophagous triatomine species, and when the vector defecates during its blood meal, the parasite is inoculated via the bite site or mucosal surfaces [2].
