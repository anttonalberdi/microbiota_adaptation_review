"3","wild","In this study, a water-soluble polysaccharide (MP) extracted from wild morels was evaluated for its effects on the gut microbiota of non-treated and CP-treated mice. "
"4","wild","Our study revealed for the first time that polysaccharides from wild morels (MP) could promote lymphocyte proliferation and change the gut microbiota in both non-treated and CP-treated mice. "
"5","wild","3 Results 3.1 Preliminary characterization of MP Crude polysaccharide was obtained from the fruiting body of wild morels and, after removal of protein, loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column. "

"7","model","After one week of adaptation, the mice were randomly divided into four groups of n = 8 as follows: the normal control group (CTC), model control group (MC), MP treatment group (PC), and CP + MP treatment group (MPC). "
"8","model","The monosaccharide composition of the MP is similar to that of MEP-1 prepared by Yang et al., but the average molecular weight of MP is greater than that of MEP-1.28 3.2 Effects of MP on spleen index As shown in Table 1, the body weight, spleen weight, and spleen index in the model control group decreased remarkably compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05). "
"9","model","Meanwhile, the CP-treated mice administered MP showed a dramatic increase in the spleen weight compared to that in the model control group (p < 0.05), with no significant changes in the body weight and spleen index. "

"11","model","As shown in Fig. 4, the model control group showed decreased levels of CD4+CD8−, CD4−CD8+, and CD4−CD8−CD19+ lymphocytes compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05), implying that CP treatment could suppress immune activities. "
"12","model","The number of OTUs was the lowest in the model control group (Table 2). "
"13","model","Compared to the model control group, group MPC showed a significant increase in OTUs (p < 0.05), and the administration of MP was shown to increase the OTUs in normal mice (p < 0.05). "
"14","model","As shown in Table 2, the model control group had decreased ACE and Chao1 indices compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05), while the administration of MP increased both ACE and Chao1 indices in the CP-treated mice (p < 0.05). "
"15","model","The second principal coordinate (PC2), which accounted for 13.11% of variance in the data, could completely separate the group MPC from the model control group. "
"16","model","PC2 could also separate the normal control group from the model control group with 80% accuracy, except for one sample in the normal control group. "

"25","model","Some species in the predominant families of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae are capable of producing SCFA, especially butyrate and propionate.37 The total levels of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae (SCFA-producing bacteria; Table 4) were significantly decreased in the model control group compared to those in the normal control group (p < 0.05).

"35","model","Comparisons of the predominant gut microbiota at different taxonomic levels (phylum and family) revealed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the two most prevalent phyla in cecum microbiota in all groups, and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was notably increased in the CP-treated mice administered MP compared to the mice in the model control group. "
"36","disease","Numerous studies have suggested that gut microbiota is closely related to the hosts’ health,3,4 metabolic phenotypes,5 the absorption or production of nutrients,6–8 and the evolution of the adaptive immune system.9 Recent studies have also revealed that changes in the composition of gut microbiota have been linked to diseases, such as obesity,10,11 type I and II diabetes,11 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),12 colon cancer,13 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),14 atherosclerosis,15,16 and hypertension.16 Mushrooms are a kind of fungus that have been valued as edible and medicinal resources for several thousands of years. "
"37","disease","It has been reported that Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae are responsible for the degradation of polysaccharides and therefore may degrade MP.53,54 The Ruminococcaceae levels are inversely related to intestinal permeability, hepatic encephalopathy, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcoholic cirrhosis.53 Lachnospiraceae and Ruminoccaceae may directly inhibit toxins produced by Clostridium difficile through their 7α-dehydroxylation activity to increase secondary bile acids and decrease primary bile acids.55 The total levels of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae (SCFA-producing bacteria37) were increased in both the non-treated and CP-treated mice after the administration of MP.

"42","environment","This may be due to SCFA-producing bacteria consuming acetate to produce butyrate via butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA-transferase.37 It is believed that increased levels of SCFAs produced by SCFA-producing bacteria can acidify the intestinal environment to protect it against several pathogenic bacteria.57 In addition, SCFAs can directly act on immune cells.

"44","human","Introduction Gut microbiota consists of a large number of microorganisms that colonize the intestinal tract of mammals.1 Approximately 1013–1014 microorganisms reside in a normal adult bowel, exceeding the total number of human cells in the body.2 Over the past few years, the development of technology—especially high-throughput sequencing techniques—has increased our understanding of the composition and function of gut microbiota. "
"45","human","3.7 Effects of MP on SCFA production Acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid are the four main SCFAs in the intestine, and all are beneficial for human health. "
"46","human","The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract carries a diversity of microbial organisms, and the gut microbiota lives in a symbiotic relationship with the host and plays an important role in the development of the immune system.51 In this study, we examined the effects of MP on the structure of gut microbiota in both the non-treated and CP-treated mice and found that MP increased the number of OTUs and the α-diversity index.
