"
"2","wild","In this study, a water-soluble polysaccharide (MP) extracted from wild morels was evaluated for its effects on the gut microbiota of non-treated and cyclophosphamide (CP)-treated mice. "
"3","wild","In this study, a water-soluble polysaccharide (MP) extracted from wild morels was evaluated for its effects on the gut microbiota of non-treated and CP-treated mice. "
"4","wild","Our study revealed for the first time that polysaccharides from wild morels (MP) could promote lymphocyte proliferation and change the gut microbiota in both non-treated and CP-treated mice. "
"5","wild","3 Results 3.1 Preliminary characterization of MP Crude polysaccharide was obtained from the fruiting body of wild morels and, after removal of protein, loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column. "
"6","adaptation","After one week of adaptation, the mice were randomly divided into four groups of n = 8 as follows: the normal control group (CTC), model control group (MC), MP treatment group (PC), and CP + MP treatment group (MPC). "
"7","model","After one week of adaptation, the mice were randomly divided into four groups of n = 8 as follows: the normal control group (CTC), model control group (MC), MP treatment group (PC), and CP + MP treatment group (MPC). "
"8","model","The monosaccharide composition of the MP is similar to that of MEP-1 prepared by Yang et al., but the average molecular weight of MP is greater than that of MEP-1.28 3.2 Effects of MP on spleen index As shown in Table 1, the body weight, spleen weight, and spleen index in the model control group decreased remarkably compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05). "
"9","model","Meanwhile, the CP-treated mice administered MP showed a dramatic increase in the spleen weight compared to that in the model control group (p < 0.05), with no significant changes in the body weight and spleen index. "
"10","model","View Article Online 3.3 Effect of MP on peripheral blood white blood cells and lymphocytes As shown in Fig. 3, the model control group had decreased counts of peripheral blood white blood cells (WBCs) and lymphocytes compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05). "
"11","model","As shown in Fig. 4, the model control group showed decreased levels of CD4+CD8−, CD4−CD8+, and CD4−CD8−CD19+ lymphocytes compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05), implying that CP treatment could suppress immune activities. "
"12","model","The number of OTUs was the lowest in the model control group (Table 2). "
"13","model","Compared to the model control group, group MPC showed a significant increase in OTUs (p < 0.05), and the administration of MP was shown to increase the OTUs in normal mice (p < 0.05). "
"14","model","As shown in Table 2, the model control group had decreased ACE and Chao1 indices compared to the normal control group (p < 0.05), while the administration of MP increased both ACE and Chao1 indices in the CP-treated mice (p < 0.05). "
"15","model","The second principal coordinate (PC2), which accounted for 13.11% of variance in the data, could completely separate the group MPC from the model control group. "
"16","model","PC2 could also separate the normal control group from the model control group with 80% accuracy, except for one sample in the normal control group. "

"24","model","MP administration significantly increased the levels of Ruminococcaceae in the CP-treated mice compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). "
"25","model","Some species in the predominant families of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae are capable of producing SCFA, especially butyrate and propionate.37 The total levels of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae (SCFA-producing bacteria; Table 4) were significantly decreased in the model control group compared to those in the normal control group (p < 0.05). "
"26","model","MP administration significantly increased the levels of SCFA-producing bacteria in the CP-treated mice compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). "
"27","model","Compared to the normal control group, the model control group exhibited distinct decreases in the relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (p < 0.05) (Table 5). "
"28","model","MP administration increased the levels of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 and decreased the levels of Lactobacillus in the CP-treated mice compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). "
"29","model","MP administration improved the production of the four SCFAs in the mice pretreated with CP compared to those in the model control group (p < 0.05). "

"35","model","Comparisons of the predominant gut microbiota at different taxonomic levels (phylum and family) revealed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the two most prevalent phyla in cecum microbiota in all groups, and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was notably increased in the CP-treated mice administered MP compared to the mice in the model control group.
