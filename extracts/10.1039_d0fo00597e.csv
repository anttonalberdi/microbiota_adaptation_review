"
"2","wild","In this study, a water-soluble polysaccharide (MP) extracted from wild morels was evaluated for its effects on the gut microbiota of non-treated and cyclophosphamide (CP)-treated mice. "
"3","wild","In this study, a water-soluble polysaccharide (MP) extracted from wild morels was evaluated for its effects on the gut microbiota of non-treated and CP-treated mice. "
"4","wild","Our study revealed for the first time that polysaccharides from wild morels (MP) could promote lymphocyte proliferation and change the gut microbiota in both non-treated and CP-treated mice. "
"5","wild","3 Results 3.1 Preliminary characterization of MP Crude polysaccharide was obtained from the fruiting body of wild morels and, after removal of protein, loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column. "
"6","adaptation","After one week of adaptation, the mice were randomly divided into four groups of n = 8 as follows: the normal control group (CTC), model control group (MC), MP treatment group (PC), and CP + MP treatment group (MPC). "
