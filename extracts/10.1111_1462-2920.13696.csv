"1","wild","In agreement with the up-regulation of sporulation genes, the sporulation efficiency is higher in the sigB mutant than in the wild-type strain. sigB inactivation also led to increased sensitivity to acidification, cationic antimicrobial peptides, nitric oxide and ROS. "
"2","wild","Finally, we demonstrated that the fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain. "
"3","wild","No significant difference in the magnitude of biofilm formation was observed between the wild-type and the sigB mutant strains in both backgrounds under the conditions used (Fig S2B) suggesting that σ B is not involved in the control of biofilm formation in C. difficile. "
"4","wild","No difference in expression was detected for the CD0007, CD0008, rsbV and rsbW genes between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain. "
"5","wild","Some genes involved in motility are differentially expressed between the wild-type and mutant strains (Table S3). "
"6","wild","Several genes involved in the formation of type IV pili (T4P) were also differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild type strain. "
"7","wild","Because T4P are involved in surface motility (Purcell et al., 2016), we tested the ability of the wild-type strain and sigB mutant in the 630∆erm and R20291 backgrounds to migrate across the surface of BHI plates in the presence of an increasing agar concentration (1% to 2%). "
"8","wild","We did not see a significant difference in surface behaviour between the wild-type strain and mutant strain under these conditions. "
"9","wild","Several genes implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis including genes involved in the production of the disaccharide-pentapeptide associated with a lipid carrier (murA, murC, murD, murE, murF, mraY, murG, uppS, and uppP1 genes) or encoding a probable peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (CD1229), an L,D-trans-peptidase (CD3007), a glutamate racemase (murI), and an alanine racemase (CD3463) were more strongly expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain (Table S4). "
"10","wild","We did not see a difference in the sensitivity to lysozyme between the wild-type strain and sigB mutant while the sigB mutant is more sensitive than the wild-type strain to two CAMPs, bacitracin and polymyxin B. "
"11","wild","All rights reserved. 10 bacitracin was 560 ± 85 µg⋅ml -1 for the 630∆erm strain and 140 ± 25 µg⋅ml -1 for the sigB mutant, while the MIC for polymyxin B was 340 ± 27 µg⋅ml -1 for the wild-type strain and 180 ± 19 µg⋅ml -1 for the mutant. "
"12","wild","Several genes encoding proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) are differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain, as observed in L. monocytogenes (Guldimann et al., 2016). "
"13","wild","11 In addition, several genes encoding putative peptidases or proteases as well as genes encoding amino acid transporters were differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to in the wild-type strain (Fig S4 and Table S5). "
"14","wild","All rights reserved. 12 to the wild-type strain. "
"15","wild","However, we did not observe a significant difference in the rate of ciprofloxacin resistance-related acquired mutations between the wild-type strain and the sigB mutant, suggesting that the decrease in the expression of mutS in this mutant is not sufficient to confer a hypermutable phenotype. "
"16","wild","Furthermore, in a liquid medium, the growth of the sigB mutant in the 630∆erm background was reduced or abrogated in the presence of 5 and 10 µM of DEA/NO, respectively (Fig 4C and 4D) or in the presence of 10 and 20 µM of SNP (Fig S6C and S6D), respectively, while the growth of the wild-type and complemented strains was only slightly affected under these conditions compared to the TY medium (Fig 4B and Fig S6B). "
"17","wild","In contrast, a sigB mutant does not show increased sensitivity to SNP as compared to the wild-type strain (Rogstam et al., 2007). "
"18","wild","Of note, the expression of CD0827, encoding the desulfoferrodoxin of CD1474 and CD1524, encoding reverserubrerythrins, and of CD0176 and CD1623, encoding proteins similar to NADH-rubredoxin reductases, strongly decreased (5to 100-fold) in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain, according to the transcriptomic data and qRT-PCR experiments both in the 630∆erm and the R20291 backgrounds (Table 1, S1 and S6). "
"19","wild","Complementation of the sigB mutants restored the phenotype observed in the wild-type strains. "
"20","wild","Consequently, we chose to compare the ability of the sigB mutant and wild-type strain to colonise the intestinal tract. "
"21","wild","We observed no fitness difference between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain during growth in co-culture in TY medium in vitro and no difference in germination efficiency. "
"22","wild","Although the wild-type strain showed quite a constant amount of bacteria until 15 days post-infection, the colonisation by the sigB mutant gradually decreased until the end of the experiment, reaching a 5-log fold lower burden than that of the 630∆erm strain (Fig 7A). "
"23","wild","We found ~10 5 bacteria per gram of caecal mucosa for the wild-type strain (Fig 7C). "
"24","wild","Although our results revealed that the sigB mutant produced 10-fold more spores than the wild-type strain did in vitro, we observed a reduction in the number of spores formed in vivo by the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain. "
"25","wild","Because the rate of spore germination in vitro is almost the same between the wildtype and sigB mutant strains, it seems unlikely that such a defect can be related to a difference in in vivo germination efficiency. "
"26","wild","PerR may contribute to the control of O2/ROS detoxification in addition to σ B or is involved in the regulation of other target genes in response to the presence of H2O2. σ B does not control toxinogenesis, but our co-infection experiments in axenic mice highlight the crucial role of σ B in the colonisation process with a drastic decrease in the number of cells of the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain in faecal and caecal contents. "
"27","wild","The histograms represent the diameters of the growth inhibition area of the wild-type strain (black), the sigB mutant (dark grey), and the complemented strain (sigB + PB sigB, light grey) in the 630∆erm and the R20291 genetic backgrounds. "

"33","fitness","Finally, we demonstrated that the fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain. "
"34","fitness","Accordingly, we found that a sigB mutant is more sensitive to various stresses mimicking those C. difficile encounters during its infectious cycle, particularly the oxidative/nitrosative stress, and its colonisation fitness is highly affected in the gut of a dixenic mouse model of colonisation. "
"35","fitness","We observed no fitness difference between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain during growth in co-culture in TY medium in vitro and no difference in germination efficiency. "
"36","fitness","At the same time, the sigB mutant showed a 3-log fold decreased burden in the faecal content suggesting a defect in colonisation fitness of this mutant when it competed with the 630∆erm strain (Fig 7A). "

"45","mutant","We showed that the survival of the sigB mutant during the stationary phase was reduced. "
"46","mutant","In agreement with the up-regulation of sporulation genes, the sporulation efficiency is higher in the sigB mutant than in the wild-type strain. sigB inactivation also led to increased sensitivity to acidification, cationic antimicrobial peptides, nitric oxide and ROS. "
"47","mutant","Finally, we demonstrated that the fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain. "
"48","mutant","Indeed, depending on the bacterial species, a mutant with inactive σ B is more sensitive to acidic or alkaline pH, high osmolarity, ethanol, some antibiotics, bile acids, oxidative stress, or temperature variations (Ferreira et al., 2001; Giachino et al., 2001; Bandow et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2011; Reder et al., 2012b). "
"49","mutant","Accordingly, we found that a sigB mutant is more sensitive to various stresses mimicking those C. difficile encounters during its infectious cycle, particularly the oxidative/nitrosative stress, and its colonisation fitness is highly affected in the gut of a dixenic mouse model of colonisation. "
"50","mutant","Results and discussion Growth stage-dependent phenotypes of the C. difficile sigB mutant. "
"51","mutant","To identify the role of σ B in the C. difficile physiology, we constructed a sigB mutant in the strain 630∆erm using the ClosTron system. "
"52","mutant","We observed similar growth of the 630∆erm strain and of the sigB mutant in both tryptone-yeast extract (TY) and brain heart infusion (BHI) media (Fig 1A and S2A). "
"53","mutant","Because σ B is a stationary-phase σ factor (Hecker et al., 2007), we tested the survival rate of strain 630∆erm and of the sigB mutant at 24, 48, and 72 h of growth in TY, a medium that does not favour the sporulation process. "
"54","mutant","After 48 h of growth, the survival rate was five-fold higher for the 630∆erm strain (31%) than for the sigB mutant (6.5%), and the difference increased to 15-fold at 72 h (Fig 1B). "
"55","mutant","Because the R20291 strain, which belongs to the BI/NAP/027 family, is known to form a more robust biofilm than the 630∆erm strain does (Ethapa et al., 2013), we also constructed a sigB mutant from the R20291 strain (Fig S1C). "
"56","mutant","No significant difference in the magnitude of biofilm formation was observed between the wild-type and the sigB mutant strains in both backgrounds under the conditions used (Fig S2B) suggesting that σ B is not involved in the control of biofilm formation in C. difficile. "
"57","mutant","Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles of 630∆erm and the sigB mutant strains at the onset of the stationary phase. "
"58","mutant","To identify genes regulated by σ B , we compared the expression profiles of the 630∆erm strain and of the sigB mutant at the onset of the stationary phase (10 h). "
"59","mutant","Approximately 25% of the C. difficile genes were differentially expressed between these two strains. 595 genes and 410 genes were upand down-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"60","mutant","No difference in expression was detected for the CD0007, CD0008, rsbV and rsbW genes between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain. "
"61","mutant","Using ELISAs, we confirmed that toxin production was similar in the 630∆erm strain and in the sigB mutant (Fig S2C). "
"62","mutant","All rights reserved. 7 mutant. "
"63","mutant","The transfer of the resulting plasmid (pDIA6325) into the sigB mutant led to sigB gene overexpression (~10-fold). "
"64","mutant","We found that more than 200 genes encoding proteins involved in all steps of spore formation or transcribed under the control of the four sporulation-specific σ factors (Lawley et al., 2009; Fimlaid et al., 2013; Saujet et al., 2013) were differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the 630∆erm strain (Table S2). "
"65","mutant","Remarkably, most genes of the σ F , σ E , and σ G regulons (84%, 96%, and 96%, respectively) were up-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"66","mutant","By contrast, only 38% of the σ K regulon was derepressed in the sigB mutant under the conditions tested. "
"67","mutant","To confirm the control of sporulation by σ B , we compared the sporulation efficiency of the sigB mutant and 630∆erm strain after 72 h of growth in the sporulation medium. "
"68","mutant","In line with the transcriptomic data, the sigB mutant produced ~10-fold more spores (3.3 × 10 6 spores⋅ml -1 ) than the 630∆erm strain did (2.5 × 10 5 spores⋅ml -1 ). "
"69","mutant","The sporulation rate was ~7% for the 630∆erm strain and ~37% for the sigB mutant. "
"70","mutant","In our transcriptomic data, the expression of CD1579 encoding a histidine kinase that phosphorylates Spo0A in vitro (Underwood et al., 2009) was up-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"71","mutant","Interestingly, CD1492, encoding a kinase sharing 30% identity with Cac0437, was down-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"72","mutant","Some genes involved in motility are differentially expressed between the wild-type and mutant strains (Table S3). "
"73","mutant","Indeed, several genes belonging to one of the two large flagellar operons were down-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"74","mutant","However, we did not detect a defect in motility in the sigB mutant compared to strain 630∆erm under our conditions (0.3% BHI agar plates), suggesting that the decrease in the expression of these genes is not sufficient to inhibit motility. "
"75","mutant","Several genes involved in the formation of type IV pili (T4P) were also differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild type strain. "
"76","mutant","The expression of the genes belonging to the secondary T4P cluster (CD3293-96) and of pilD2 (CD3503) that encodes a pre-pilin peptidase was up-regulated in the sigB mutant (Table S3). "
"77","mutant","By contrast, the gene CD3513 encoding the major pilin (PilA1) in this primary cluster was down-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"78","mutant","Because T4P are involved in surface motility (Purcell et al., 2016), we tested the ability of the wild-type strain and sigB mutant in the 630∆erm and R20291 backgrounds to migrate across the surface of BHI plates in the presence of an increasing agar concentration (1% to 2%). "
"79","mutant","We did not see a significant difference in surface behaviour between the wild-type strain and mutant strain under these conditions. "
"80","mutant","Our transcriptomic data also showed that the expression of several genes encoding surfaceassociated proteins (Janoir, 2016) decreased in the sigB mutant (Table S3). "
"81","mutant","By contrast, genes encoding the lipoprotein CD0873 involved in adhesion of C. difficile to Caco-2 cells (Janoir, 2016), the fibronectin-binding protein FbpA, and a cell wall-binding protein of unknown function (cwp28/CD1987) were up-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"82","mutant","Several genes implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis including genes involved in the production of the disaccharide-pentapeptide associated with a lipid carrier (murA, murC, murD, murE, murF, mraY, murG, uppS, and uppP1 genes) or encoding a probable peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (CD1229), an L,D-trans-peptidase (CD3007), a glutamate racemase (murI), and an alanine racemase (CD3463) were more strongly expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain (Table S4). "
"83","mutant","We also observed increased expression in the sigB mutant of genes encoding two putative N-acetyl-muramoyl-L-alanine amidases (CD0784 and CD2761), a putative lytic trans-glycosylase (CD1130), and a serinetype D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase (CD2141). "
"84","mutant","By contrast, genes encoding a probable deacetylase of peptidoglycan (CD1522), another L,D-transpeptidase (CD2963), a D-Ala-DAla-carboxypeptidase (CD2504), or two cell-wall hydrolases (CD0183, CD1898) were less strongly expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the 630∆erm strain (Table S4). "
"85","mutant","We did not see a difference in the sensitivity to lysozyme between the wild-type strain and sigB mutant while the sigB mutant is more sensitive than the wild-type strain to two CAMPs, bacitracin and polymyxin B. "
"86","mutant","All rights reserved. 10 bacitracin was 560 ± 85 µg⋅ml -1 for the 630∆erm strain and 140 ± 25 µg⋅ml -1 for the sigB mutant, while the MIC for polymyxin B was 340 ± 27 µg⋅ml -1 for the wild-type strain and 180 ± 19 µg⋅ml -1 for the mutant. "
"87","mutant","These data are consistent with the decreased expression in the sigB mutant of dltA and dltD involved in teichoic acid D-alanylation, a mechanism of protection from CAMPs in C. difficile (McBride and Sonenshein, 2011b). "
"88","mutant","Because polymyxin B is known to increase ROS formation (Yu et al., 2015), the increased toxicity of polymyxin B for the sigB mutant may be due to the increased sensitivity of this mutant to ROS (see below). "
"89","mutant","Several genes encoding proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) are differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain, as observed in L. monocytogenes (Guldimann et al., 2016). "
"90","mutant","Genes encoding PTS specific for glucose, fructose, cellobiose, and β-glucoside (CD2666-67, CD2269, CD3089, and CD313738, respectively) and the ptsH gene encoding HPr, a general component of the PTS, were negatively controlled by σ B (Fig S3) whereas gene encoding xylosides and galactitol PTS transporters allowing utilization of alternative carbon sources were positively controlled by σ B Most of the genes involved in glycolysis were also more strongly expressed in the sigB mutant, while genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis were less strongly expressed in this mutant (Fig S3). "
"91","mutant","Thus, all these results pointed to an increase in the import of glucose or glucose-containing compounds, a drop in carbon storage, and enhanced flux into glycolysis in the sigB mutant. "
"92","mutant","The CD2966 gene (adhE) encoding an aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase participating in ethanol and butanol production is up-regulated in the sigB mutant while genes CD0112-13 and CD2379 encoding enzymes involved in butyrate production are downregulated (Fig S3). "
"93","mutant","11 In addition, several genes encoding putative peptidases or proteases as well as genes encoding amino acid transporters were differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to in the wild-type strain (Fig S4 and Table S5). "
"94","mutant","The sigB mutant of L. monocytogenes has a reduced ability to grow on glycerol, an alternative energy source during intracellular life of the bacteria (Guldimann et al., 2016). "
"95","mutant","The expression of a few of them, such as those encoding the GroES and GroEL chaperones, a heat-shock protein (CD3219), or a multidrug family ABC-transporter (CD3198), increased in the sigB mutant compared to in the 630∆erm strain (Table 1). "
"96","mutant","The expression of uvrABC as well as mutS decreased in the sigB mutant compared Page 11 of 53 Wiley-Blackwell and Society for Applied Microbiology This article is protected by copyright. "
"97","mutant","We therefore compared the sensitivity of the 630∆erm strain and sigB mutant to several antibiotics known to induce DNA damage. "
"98","mutant","The rates of sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and metronidazole were similar between the sigB mutant and the parental strain. "
"99","mutant","However, for mitomycin C, known to causes DNA alkylation, the diameter of the growth inhibition area for the sigB mutant increased by more than 50%, as compared to the 630∆erm strain (Fig 2A). "
"100","mutant","However, we found that the sigB mutant was more sensitive than the parental strain only when the cells were exposed to rifampicin (Fig 2B) as observed in B. subtilis (Bandow et al., 2002). "
"101","mutant","Since rifampicin induces in B. subtilis the activity of σ B and members of the oxidative stress stimulon (Bandow et al., 2002), it is possible that the oxidative stress induced by this antibiotics is responsible for the higher sensitivity of the sigB mutant to this compound in C. difficile (see below). "
"102","mutant","However, we did not observe a significant difference in the rate of ciprofloxacin resistance-related acquired mutations between the wild-type strain and the sigB mutant, suggesting that the decrease in the expression of mutS in this mutant is not sufficient to confer a hypermutable phenotype. "
"103","mutant","However, we failed to detect under our experimental conditions a difference in sensitivity between the 630∆erm strain and the sigB mutant when they were exposed to bile extracts, deoxycholate and cholate, or to NaCl (Fig S5). "
"104","mutant","No growth was observed at pH 4.5 in the parental strain, the sigB mutant, and the complemented strain, but they grew similarly at pH 7, 6.5, and 6 (Fig 3). "
"105","mutant","By contrast, compared to the parental and complemented strains, the growth of the sigB mutant was slightly and severely affected at pH 5.5 and 5.0, respectively, indicating that σ B controls, at least partly, the acid stress management. "
"106","mutant","The down-regulation of glsA and gluD genes in the sigB mutant that probably leads to reduced production of NH4 + might contribute to the increased sensitivity of this mutant to lower pH. "
"107","mutant","Furthermore, it is worth noting that genes encoding hydrogenases such as CD0893 and CD3313-15 (hydN1-hydAhydN2; Fig S3) were down-regulated in the sigB mutant. "
"108","mutant","Thus, the low expression of hydrogenase genes in the sigB mutant may increase proton concentration and acid sensitivity. "
"109","mutant","Moreover, it is possible that substantial rerouting of metabolism leads to accumulation of compounds that contribute to increased sensitivity of the sigB mutant to acid stress. "
"110","mutant","Indeed, the expression of CD1157 (norV) encoding a putative NO-reductase and of two genes (CD1125 and CD0837) encoding nitro-reductases, decreased 20-, 17-, and two-fold, respectively, in the sigB mutant compared to the strain 630∆erm. "
"111","mutant","Moreover, the expression of CD1822 (hcp), which encodes a hydroxylamine reductase that could be used for a NO detoxification process, also decreased five-fold in the sigB mutant (Table 1 and Table S1). "
"112","mutant","To test the involvement of σ B in the control of NO detoxification, we compared the sensitivity of 630∆erm, the sigB mutant, and the complemented strain to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and di-ethylamine NoNoate (DEA/NO), two NO donor compounds, by plating serial dilutions of these strains or by growth monitoring in a liquid medium. "
"113","mutant","After 24 h of incubation on plates, the sigB mutant had a growth defect in the presence of DEA/NO or SNP as compared to the parental and complemented strains in both 630∆erm and R20291 backgrounds (NAP/027) (Fig 4A and Fig S6A). "
"114","mutant","Furthermore, in a liquid medium, the growth of the sigB mutant in the 630∆erm background was reduced or abrogated in the presence of 5 and 10 µM of DEA/NO, respectively (Fig 4C and 4D) or in the presence of 10 and 20 µM of SNP (Fig S6C and S6D), respectively, while the growth of the wild-type and complemented strains was only slightly affected under these conditions compared to the TY medium (Fig 4B and Fig S6B). "
"115","mutant","We next compared the survival among the parental strain, the sigB mutant, and the complemented strain after 30 min of exposure to SNP or DEA/NO. "
"116","mutant","The survival was 40and 13-fold higher in 630∆erm than in the sigB mutant when exposed to 40 µM SNP and to 25 µM DEA/NO, respectively. "
"117","mutant","In contrast, a sigB mutant does not show increased sensitivity to SNP as compared to the wild-type strain (Rogstam et al., 2007). "
"118","mutant","Using disk diffusion assays, we showed that the growth inhibition area for the sigB mutant increased in the presence of H2O2 (1 M) or paraquat (2 M, an O2 anion donor) from 30% to 60% as compared to the parental and complemented strains in the 630∆erm and R20291 genetic backgrounds (Fig 5A and 5B, respectively). "
"119","mutant","Of note, the expression of CD0827, encoding the desulfoferrodoxin of CD1474 and CD1524, encoding reverserubrerythrins, and of CD0176 and CD1623, encoding proteins similar to NADH-rubredoxin reductases, strongly decreased (5to 100-fold) in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain, according to the transcriptomic data and qRT-PCR experiments both in the 630∆erm and the R20291 backgrounds (Table 1, S1 and S6). "
"120","mutant","Although the role of these proteins in ROS detoxification remains to be experimentally characterised in C. difficile, it seems likely that the control of their transcription by σ B contributes to the increased sensitivity of the sigB mutant to ROS exposure. "
"121","mutant","In addition, the expression of gluD, encoding a glutamate dehydrogenase that is involved in C. difficile in H2O2 protection via an uncharacterised mechanism, also decreased three-fold in the sigB mutant (Girinathan et al., 2014). "
"122","mutant","Indeed, the viability of a sigB mutant of L. monocytogenes Page 15 of 53 Wiley-Blackwell and Society for Applied Microbiology This article is protected by copyright. "
"123","mutant","Moreover, in B. subtilis, the sigB mutant is more sensitive to oxidative stress when cells are pre-adapted to a stress such as glucose starvation known to induce the activity of σ B before exposure to H2O2 or paraquat (Engelmann and Hecker, 1996; Reder et al., 2012b). "
"124","mutant","We therefore compared the sensitivity of the parental strain, sigB mutant, and complemented strain to exposure to 200 mM tellurite. "
"125","mutant","As shown in Figure 5C, the sigB mutant was much more sensitive to tellurite than the parental and complemented strains in both 630∆erm and R20291 backgrounds. "
"126","mutant","In disk diffusion assays, we found that the black deposit was less opaque in the sigB mutant than in the parental and complemented strains (Fig 5D). "
"127","mutant","The increased sensitivity of the sigB mutant to tellurite may be due to the combined action of several mechanisms: i) a drop of the synthesis of tellurium resistance proteins, ii) a down-regulation of genes involved in import and production of cysteine (see below), a compound promoting the formation of tellurium (Hullo et al., 2010), and iii) a reduced resistance to oxidative stress induced by the strong oxidizing ability of tellurite (Chasteen et al., 2009). "
"128","mutant","All rights reserved. 17 taller for the sigB mutant than for the parental strain in both 630∆erm and R20291 genetic backgrounds (Fig 6A and 6B). "
"129","mutant","Complementation of the sigB mutants restored the phenotype observed in the wild-type strains. "
"130","mutant","To determine the level of O2 tension supported by C. difficile and to confirm the involvement of σ B in O2 tolerance, we monitored the growth of the 630∆erm and R20291 strains, their respective sigB mutants, and the complemented strains when exposed to various levels of O2 tension. "
"131","mutant","By contrast, in the presence of 0.1% or 0.4% of O2, the sigB mutants showed a drastic growth defect as compared to the parental or complemented strains (Fig 6C). "
"132","mutant","Among them, 37 are positively controlled by σ B (Table 1), in line with the phenotype of high sensitivity to O2 observed in the sigB mutant. "
"133","mutant","In our transcriptome data, genes coding for proteins involved in thiol protection such as one of the thioredoxins (trxA-CD1690), the thiol-peroxidase (CD1822), the methionine sulfoxide reductase (msrAB-CD2166), and a protein annotated as a putative CoASH-reductase (CD1797) were down-regulated in the sigB mutant compared to the 630∆erm strain (Table 1). "
"134","mutant","When we tested whether the reduced expression of these genes leads to increased sensitivity to diamide, an oxidizing agent specifically targeting thiols, we did not observe significant differences between the sigB mutant and the parental strain under our conditions (Fig S7A). "
"135","mutant","In a rich medium containing peptides and likely cysteine, the control of only one trx system (CD1690-91) by σ B may not be sufficient to detect a change in sensitivity to diamide in the sigB mutant. "
"136","mutant","In addition, we found that the expression of genes involved in cysteine synthesis (CD1594) or encoding transporters of cysteine/cystine and sulfonates, which are sulphur compounds leading to cysteine production (Table 1 and Fig S4) (Dubois et al., 2016) also decreased in the sigB mutant. "
"137","mutant","Gut colonisation efficiency of the sigB mutant in a murine dixenic model. "
"138","mutant","Consequently, we chose to compare the ability of the sigB mutant and wild-type strain to colonise the intestinal tract. "
"139","mutant","We observed no fitness difference between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain during growth in co-culture in TY medium in vitro and no difference in germination efficiency. "
"140","mutant","To prevent vegetative cells of the sigB mutant from getting killed by air exposure, we infected the mice with an approximately equivalent amount (1:1) of purified spores of the 630∆erm strain and of the sigB mutant. "
"141","mutant","At the same time, the sigB mutant showed a 3-log fold decreased burden in the faecal content suggesting a defect in colonisation fitness of this mutant when it competed with the 630∆erm strain (Fig 7A). "
"142","mutant","Although the wild-type strain showed quite a constant amount of bacteria until 15 days post-infection, the colonisation by the sigB mutant gradually decreased until the end of the experiment, reaching a 5-log fold lower burden than that of the 630∆erm strain (Fig 7A). "
"143","mutant","Similar results were obtained for the caecal-lumen contents: a 3and 5-log fold difference in bacterial burden between the 630∆erm strain and the sigB mutant after 2 and 15 days of infection, respectively (Fig 7B). "
"144","mutant","Furthermore, we observed few if any colonies of the sigB mutant indicating a major defect in its association with the caecal mucosa during the infectious cycle. "
"145","mutant","Although our results revealed that the sigB mutant produced 10-fold more spores than the wild-type strain did in vitro, we observed a reduction in the number of spores formed in vivo by the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain. "
"146","mutant","This result can probably be explained by the rapid elimination of the vegetative cells of the sigB mutant since the beginning of infection, thus preventing the sporulation process. "
"147","mutant","Several hypotheses may explain the huge defect in the sigB mutant in terms of colonisation of the gut. "
"148","mutant","Because the rate of spore germination in vitro is almost the same between the wildtype and sigB mutant strains, it seems unlikely that such a defect can be related to a difference in in vivo germination efficiency. "
"149","mutant","However, it seems unlikely that the decrease in the expression of gluD in a sigB mutant is sufficient to explain the drastic defect in colonisation in our model of co-infection. "
"150","mutant","Indeed, the co-infection of a hamster with the gluD mutant and the parental strain partially restores gut colonisation of the mutant, suggesting that production and secretion of this enzyme by the parental strain is sufficient to support the growth of the mutant in vivo. "
"151","mutant","All rights reserved. 21 the reduced ability of the sigB mutant to face acidification of its environment probably affects the colonisation efficiency of this mutant. "
"152","mutant","Even if the lack of a microbiota lowers the magnitude of the inflammatory response in axenic mice, the absence of σ B probably prevents the protection of the bacteria from ROS and RNS produced by the host during inflammation (Abt et al., 2016; Jose and Madan, 2016) and this situation should contribute to the reduced ability of the sigB mutant to colonise the gut. "
"153","mutant","It is noteworthy that these different hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and that the severe impairment of the capacity for intestinal-tract colonisation in the sigB mutant is a multi-factorial phenomenon. "
"154","mutant","Indeed, a sigBnull mutant of Bacillus anthracis is less virulent in a mouse model (Guldimann et al., 2016). "
"155","mutant","In L. monocytogenes, the role of σ B is rather clear because a sigB mutant causes attenuated oral infection in a guinea pig model and is less invasive in CaCo-2 cells (Guldimann et al., 2016). "
"156","mutant","This decrease in virulence and in colonisation capacity may be explained by two mechanisms acting either separately or in association, i.e. i) the inability of the sigB mutant to adapt to changing environmental conditions or to the exposure to antimicrobial compounds inside the host or ii) the positive or negative control of virulence or pathogenesis factors by σ B (Guldimann et al., 2016). "
"157","mutant","Accordingly, we observed a drop in survival of the sigB mutant during the stationary phase when the cells face more stressful conditions. "
"158","mutant","PerR may contribute to the control of O2/ROS detoxification in addition to σ B or is involved in the regulation of other target genes in response to the presence of H2O2. σ B does not control toxinogenesis, but our co-infection experiments in axenic mice highlight the crucial role of σ B in the colonisation process with a drastic decrease in the number of cells of the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain in faecal and caecal contents. "
"159","mutant","The increased sensitivity of the sigB mutant to CAMPs also suggests that σ B may contribute to the evasion of host innate defences involving antimicrobial peptides. "
"160","mutant","Finally, the positive control by σ B of genes encoding several cell surface-associated proteins induced during the early steps of colonisation (Janoir et al., 2013) or involved in adhesion to epithelial cells or to extracellular-matrix components (Janoir, 2016) combined with the failure to detect the sigB mutant in the caecal mucosa suggest that σ B may contribute to the ability of C. difficile to adhere to the intestinal-tract cells. "
"161","mutant","To complement the sigB mutants, the sigB gene (positions -59 to +811 from the translational start site) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides IMV705 and IMV704. "
"162","mutant","This plasmid was transferred by conjugation into the C. difficile sigB mutants obtained in the 630∆erm and R20291 backgrounds yielding strains CDIP547 and CDIP505, respectively (Table S8). "
