"1","wild","In agreement with the up-regulation of sporulation genes, the sporulation efficiency is higher in the sigB mutant than in the wild-type strain. sigB inactivation also led to increased sensitivity to acidification, cationic antimicrobial peptides, nitric oxide and ROS. "
"2","wild","Finally, we demonstrated that the fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain. "
"3","wild","No significant difference in the magnitude of biofilm formation was observed between the wild-type and the sigB mutant strains in both backgrounds under the conditions used (Fig S2B) suggesting that σ B is not involved in the control of biofilm formation in C. difficile. "
"4","wild","No difference in expression was detected for the CD0007, CD0008, rsbV and rsbW genes between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain. "
"5","wild","Some genes involved in motility are differentially expressed between the wild-type and mutant strains (Table S3). "
"6","wild","Several genes involved in the formation of type IV pili (T4P) were also differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild type strain. "
"7","wild","Because T4P are involved in surface motility (Purcell et al., 2016), we tested the ability of the wild-type strain and sigB mutant in the 630∆erm and R20291 backgrounds to migrate across the surface of BHI plates in the presence of an increasing agar concentration (1% to 2%). "
"8","wild","We did not see a significant difference in surface behaviour between the wild-type strain and mutant strain under these conditions. "
"9","wild","Several genes implicated in peptidoglycan synthesis including genes involved in the production of the disaccharide-pentapeptide associated with a lipid carrier (murA, murC, murD, murE, murF, mraY, murG, uppS, and uppP1 genes) or encoding a probable peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (CD1229), an L,D-trans-peptidase (CD3007), a glutamate racemase (murI), and an alanine racemase (CD3463) were more strongly expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain (Table S4). "
"10","wild","We did not see a difference in the sensitivity to lysozyme between the wild-type strain and sigB mutant while the sigB mutant is more sensitive than the wild-type strain to two CAMPs, bacitracin and polymyxin B. "
"11","wild","All rights reserved. 10 bacitracin was 560 ± 85 µg⋅ml -1 for the 630∆erm strain and 140 ± 25 µg⋅ml -1 for the sigB mutant, while the MIC for polymyxin B was 340 ± 27 µg⋅ml -1 for the wild-type strain and 180 ± 19 µg⋅ml -1 for the mutant. "
"12","wild","Several genes encoding proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) are differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain, as observed in L. monocytogenes (Guldimann et al., 2016). "
"13","wild","11 In addition, several genes encoding putative peptidases or proteases as well as genes encoding amino acid transporters were differentially expressed in the sigB mutant compared to in the wild-type strain (Fig S4 and Table S5). "
"14","wild","All rights reserved. 12 to the wild-type strain. "
"15","wild","However, we did not observe a significant difference in the rate of ciprofloxacin resistance-related acquired mutations between the wild-type strain and the sigB mutant, suggesting that the decrease in the expression of mutS in this mutant is not sufficient to confer a hypermutable phenotype. "
"16","wild","Furthermore, in a liquid medium, the growth of the sigB mutant in the 630∆erm background was reduced or abrogated in the presence of 5 and 10 µM of DEA/NO, respectively (Fig 4C and 4D) or in the presence of 10 and 20 µM of SNP (Fig S6C and S6D), respectively, while the growth of the wild-type and complemented strains was only slightly affected under these conditions compared to the TY medium (Fig 4B and Fig S6B). "
"17","wild","In contrast, a sigB mutant does not show increased sensitivity to SNP as compared to the wild-type strain (Rogstam et al., 2007). "
"18","wild","Of note, the expression of CD0827, encoding the desulfoferrodoxin of CD1474 and CD1524, encoding reverserubrerythrins, and of CD0176 and CD1623, encoding proteins similar to NADH-rubredoxin reductases, strongly decreased (5to 100-fold) in the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain, according to the transcriptomic data and qRT-PCR experiments both in the 630∆erm and the R20291 backgrounds (Table 1, S1 and S6). "
"19","wild","Complementation of the sigB mutants restored the phenotype observed in the wild-type strains. "
"20","wild","Consequently, we chose to compare the ability of the sigB mutant and wild-type strain to colonise the intestinal tract. "
"21","wild","We observed no fitness difference between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain during growth in co-culture in TY medium in vitro and no difference in germination efficiency. "
"22","wild","Although the wild-type strain showed quite a constant amount of bacteria until 15 days post-infection, the colonisation by the sigB mutant gradually decreased until the end of the experiment, reaching a 5-log fold lower burden than that of the 630∆erm strain (Fig 7A). "
"23","wild","We found ~10 5 bacteria per gram of caecal mucosa for the wild-type strain (Fig 7C). "
"24","wild","Although our results revealed that the sigB mutant produced 10-fold more spores than the wild-type strain did in vitro, we observed a reduction in the number of spores formed in vivo by the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain. "
"25","wild","Because the rate of spore germination in vitro is almost the same between the wildtype and sigB mutant strains, it seems unlikely that such a defect can be related to a difference in in vivo germination efficiency. "
"26","wild","PerR may contribute to the control of O2/ROS detoxification in addition to σ B or is involved in the regulation of other target genes in response to the presence of H2O2. σ B does not control toxinogenesis, but our co-infection experiments in axenic mice highlight the crucial role of σ B in the colonisation process with a drastic decrease in the number of cells of the sigB mutant compared to the wild-type strain in faecal and caecal contents. "
"27","wild","The histograms represent the diameters of the growth inhibition area of the wild-type strain (black), the sigB mutant (dark grey), and the complemented strain (sigB + PB sigB, light grey) in the 630∆erm and the R20291 genetic backgrounds. "
"28","wild","A) The histograms represent the distance of growth inhibition between the top of the agar at air interface and the edge of visible bacterial growth for the wild-type (black), the sigB mutant (dark grey), and the sigB + PB-sigB complemented strain (light grey) in the 630∆erm and the R20291 genetic backgrounds. "
"29","wild","C) Serial dilutions of the wild-type (1 and 4), the sigB mutant (2 and 5) and the complemented strain (sigB + PB sigB) (3 and 6) in both the 630∆erm (1, 2 and 3) and the R20291 (4, 5 and 6) genetic backgrounds, respectively were spotted on TY + 0.05% taurocholate. "
"30","wild","A) Growth curve of the wild-type strain (black circle) and the sigB mutant (dark grey square) grown in BHI. "
"31","wild","The histogram represents the ratio of the intracellular amount of TcdA between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain. "
"32","wild","CDIP229: 630∆erm sigB::erm, CDIP547: 630∆erm sigB::erm pRPF185-PsigB-sigB (see Table S8). qRT-PCR experiments were performed on three different RNA preparations for the wild-type, the sigB mutant and the complemented strains. "
"33","fitness","Finally, we demonstrated that the fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain. "
"34","fitness","Accordingly, we found that a sigB mutant is more sensitive to various stresses mimicking those C. difficile encounters during its infectious cycle, particularly the oxidative/nitrosative stress, and its colonisation fitness is highly affected in the gut of a dixenic mouse model of colonisation. "
"35","fitness","We observed no fitness difference between the sigB mutant and the wild-type strain during growth in co-culture in TY medium in vitro and no difference in germination efficiency. "
"36","fitness","At the same time, the sigB mutant showed a 3-log fold decreased burden in the faecal content suggesting a defect in colonisation fitness of this mutant when it competed with the 630∆erm strain (Fig 7A). "

"38","adaptation","This observation is suggestive of possible adaptation to metabolic pathways required for host colonisation. "
"39","adaptation","However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation to acidic stress have yet to be elucidated. "
"40","adaptation","In several firmicutes including C. difficile, σ B contributes to the regulation of metabolic function; this regulation can favour adaptation and survival of bacteria when exposed to changing or complex environments like those of the gastrointestinal tract. "
"41","adaptation","Interestingly, the gluD gene encoding a NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase involved in glutamate catabolism is positively controlled by σ B , indicating the probable importance of σ B for metabolic adaptation during the infection process. "
