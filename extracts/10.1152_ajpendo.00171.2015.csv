"1","wild","Here we observed that in wild-type (WT) mice the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased during pregnancy. "
"2","wild","Ffar2/ mice (on a C57BL/6J background) were bred and Ffar2/ and wild-type (WT) mice were generated as previously described (25). "
"3","wild","A: principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot of weighted UniFrac distances between microbial communities of wild-type (WT) mice before copulation (G0), the day of copulation (G0), gestation day 15 (G15), gestation day 20 (G20), postpartum day 3 (PP03), and postpartum day 20 (PP20). "
"4","wild","B: abundance plot of the prominent phyla in each mouse [wild type (WT) and Ffar2/] at baseline (G0) and during pregnancy (G15). "
"5","wild","Data represent the total and individual levels of metabolites and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) measured in the cecum and blood plasma of wild-type mice (n 8), respectively. "
"6","adaptat","Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel role of FFA2 in maternal adaptation to insulin resistance by contributing to -cell adaptation to pregnancy. "
"7","adaptat","Because FFA2 is a unique receptor that senses metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, we interrogated these variables and found that gestation influences the gut microbiota and SCFA production, whereas signaling through FFA2, a receptor for SCFA, was important for -cell adaptation to pregnancy, suggesting that the gut microbiota, SCFAs, and FFA2 act in concert during pregnancy to mediate gestational glucose homeostasis. "
"8","adaptat","Loss HGF/cMet signaling in pancreatic -cells leads to incomplete maternal -cell adaptation and gestational diabetes mellitus. "
"9","adaptat","Incretin receptor null mice reveal key role of GLP-1 but NOT GIP in pancreatic beta cell adaptation to pregnancy. "
"10","adaptat","Prolactin receptors are critical to the adaptation of islets to pregnancy. "
"11","model","METHODS Mouse model. "
"12","model","Although we did not detect significant phyla level remodeling of the gut microbiota during pregnancy at G15, we did observe that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria [5-fold increase in the relative abundance at postpartum day 3 (PP3) compared with before pregnancy, G0] and Bacteroidetes (65% prepregnancy to 80% by postpartum day 20) was significantly altered (P  0.05; Fig. "
"13","model","As before, we measured the levels of SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate), along with succinate and lactate, in the cecum of the Ffar2/ model before and during pregnancy (G15) and compared them with WT mice. "
"14","model","This model is consistent with the observations that 1) Ffar2 mRNA levels are upregulated during pregnancy, 2) deletion of Ffar2 results in impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy due to diminished insulin secretion and -cell proliferation, 3) pregnancy influences SCFA levels in the cecum and the blood, and 4) the phyla Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes change in relative abundance during pregnancy. "
"15","model","The use of a global Ffar2/ model is a limitation of this study, since the disruption of FFA2 signaling in other cell types that contribute to glucose homeostasis, such as intestinal L Fig. "
"16","model","The model proposed in Fig. 8 raises two important questions: 1) how does altering the gut microbiota-SCFA relationship affect the role of FFA2 in maintaining gestational glucose homeostasis, and 2) what pregnancy-related factors influence the ability of gut microbes to produce SCFAs? "
"17","model","Host remodeling of the gut microbiome and metabolic changes during pregnancy. "
"18","model","Advancements and challenges in generating accurate animal models of gestational diabetes mellitus. "
"19","environment","First, compared with the human study, which examined a large group of pregnant women between the first and third trimesters, we examined rodents in a controlled housing and dietary environment. "
"20","environment","Even in this controlled environment, the mice exhibited changes in the gut microbial community during pregnancy. "
"21","environment","Because human microbiome studies are problematic due to the sizable influence of the many confounding variables (including medications, dietary habits, changes in housing environments), future controlled rodent studies may help to dissect the many factors contributing to gestational effects on the gut microbiome. "
"22","environment","One possibility is that the hormonal environment of the host during pregnancy alters the gut microbiota and this drives SCFA production. "
"23","environment","The gut microbiota as an environmental factor that regulates fat storage. "
"24","human","First published September 22, 2015; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00171.2015.â€”The structure of the human gastrointestinal microbiota can change during pregnancy, which may influence gestational metabolism; however, a mechanism of action remains unclear. "
"25","human","In human pregnancy, it has been observed that the structure of the gut microbiota changes drastically, resulting in a reduction in species richness, from trimester 1 to 3 (20). "
"26","human","Because of the findings in humans (20), we explored these data at the individual phyla level at baseline and during pregnancy (at gestation day 15; G15), where G15 is a time point of heightened insulin resistance and metabolic change in the mouse (18) (Fig. "
"27","human","18.7  1.9, mean  SE, n 8) similar to what has been described in human pregnant women (6). "
"28","human","As observed before in humans (20), pregnancy can influence the composition of the gut microbiome, with changes in community diversity between trimesters (1st and 3rd). "
"29","human","First, compared with the human study, which examined a large group of pregnant women between the first and third trimesters, we examined rodents in a controlled housing and dietary environment. "
"30","human","However, as opposed to the human study, the compositional changes in the gut microbiome became more apparent in the postpartum period. "
"31","human","Because human microbiome studies are problematic due to the sizable influence of the many confounding variables (including medications, dietary habits, changes in housing environments), future controlled rodent studies may help to dissect the many factors contributing to gestational effects on the gut microbiome.
