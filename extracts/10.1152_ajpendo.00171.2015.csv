"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","Here we observed that in wild-type (WT) mice the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased during pregnancy. "
"2","wild","Ffar2/ mice (on a C57BL/6J background) were bred and Ffar2/ and wild-type (WT) mice were generated as previously described (25). "
"3","wild","A: principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot of weighted UniFrac distances between microbial communities of wild-type (WT) mice before copulation (G0), the day of copulation (G0), gestation day 15 (G15), gestation day 20 (G20), postpartum day 3 (PP03), and postpartum day 20 (PP20). "
"4","wild","B: abundance plot of the prominent phyla in each mouse [wild type (WT) and Ffar2/] at baseline (G0) and during pregnancy (G15). "
"5","wild","Data represent the total and individual levels of metabolites and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) measured in the cecum and blood plasma of wild-type mice (n 8), respectively. "
"6","adaptation","Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel role of FFA2 in maternal adaptation to insulin resistance by contributing to -cell adaptation to pregnancy. "
"7","adaptation","Because FFA2 is a unique receptor that senses metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, we interrogated these variables and found that gestation influences the gut microbiota and SCFA production, whereas signaling through FFA2, a receptor for SCFA, was important for -cell adaptation to pregnancy, suggesting that the gut microbiota, SCFAs, and FFA2 act in concert during pregnancy to mediate gestational glucose homeostasis. "
"8","adaptation","Loss HGF/cMet signaling in pancreatic -cells leads to incomplete maternal -cell adaptation and gestational diabetes mellitus. "
"9","adaptation","Incretin receptor null mice reveal key role of GLP-1 but NOT GIP in pancreatic beta cell adaptation to pregnancy. "
"10","adaptation","Prolactin receptors are critical to the adaptation of islets to pregnancy. "
