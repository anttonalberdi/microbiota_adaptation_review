"2","wild","Here, to study the potential relationship of the symbiotic microbiomes of wild amphibians with altitude, we collected the gut and skin samples from frogs (nine species) and the environmental samples (water and soil samples) from the Leshan Mountains (altitude: 360–410 m) and Gongga Mountains (altitude: 3340–3989 m) on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.

"25","environment","The Tibetan Plateau has a unique environment characterized by low temperature, humidity, and air pressure. "
"26","environment","Many species (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) inhabit high-altitude environments (Jungfer, 2011; Zhang, Li, Tang, Liu, & Zhao, 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2016). "
"27","environment","Research on extreme environment microorganisms has focused on symbiotic organisms harbored by animals inhabiting high altitudes and their ability to adapt to extreme environments. "
"28","environment","These bacterial groups may help humans and pigs adapt more easily to the high-altitude environment. "
"29","environment","Moreover, compared to gut microbes, skin microbes are believed to be more susceptible to environmental fluctuations (Longo, Savage, Ian, & Zamudio, 2015; Longo & Zamudio, 2017). "
"30","environment","Amphibians are well known for their extreme sensitivity to environmental changes compared to other vertebrate groups (Hopkins, 2007). "
"31","environment","Symbiotic bacteria (i.e., gut and skin microbes) play essential roles in regulating amphibians’ capacity for environmental adaptation (Chang, Huang, Lin, Huang, & Liao, 2016). "
"32","environment","Amphibian skin is a uniquely selective environment that harbors dominant bacterial groups (Walke et al., 2014). "
"33","environment","Due to direct contact with the environment, amphibian skin microbes are influenced by various environmental factors (e.g., temperature and moisture) (Longo & Zamudio, 2017; Varela, Lesbarrères, Ibáñez, & Green, 2018). "
"34","environment","The frog gut microbiome can vary across different habitats, which may help the host utilize food resources more effectively and adapt to environmental changes (Chang et al., 2016; Huang, Chang, Huang, Gao, & Liao, 2017). "
"35","environment","Compared with the skin microbe composition of other animals living on plateaus, the composition of amphibian skin microbes may be especially important in helping them adapt to the high-altitude environment (Zeng et al., 2017). "
"36","environment","Therefore, a better understanding of amphibian skin and gut microbes can help us better understand and study amphibians living in high-altitude environments. "
"37","environment","(c) What are the potential relationships between the frog symbiotic microbiome and the environmental microbial community (e.g., aquatic microbial community)? "
"38","environment","2  | MATERIAL S AND METHODS 2.1 | Sample collection Eighty-eight gut samples, 77 skin samples, and 39 environmental samples (14 water samples and 24 soil samples) were collected from the Leshan and Gongga Mountains in Sichuan Province, China, between May and July 2018 (Table 1). "
"39","environment","For environmental sampling, each water sample was collected in two 5-L sterile PET bottles and stored immediately at −20°C (Liu et al., 2018). "
"40","environment","This software is typically used to explore pollution sources and sinks and is therefore appropriate for the analysis of the proportion of the environmental microbial community in the symbiotic microorganism communities of amphibians in this study. "
"41","environment","The aquatic and soil microbial communities were treated as sources of environmental microbes, while the gut and skin microbiomes were treated as sinks in this analysis. "
"42","environment","3.8 | Correlation between symbiotic and environmental microbiomes The results of the source-tracker analysis revealed that a high number of skin microbes present in all amphibians (or only in Bg) at high and low elevations were from the aquatic microbial community (Figure 6b,d). "
"43","environment","4.1 | Putative relationship between the composition of microbial groups and the altitude environment Environmental factors have profound effects on the skin and gut microbial composition of amphibians (Das et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2017). "
"44","environment","We observed many significantly enriched microbes in the skin samples, which may reflect selection pressure from the highaltitude environment. "
"45","environment","Considering the relatively high proportion of water-originating microbes in the H-Bg skin samples, we speculated that in high-altitude environments, Bg may be more likely to live in an aquatic environment than Bg at low-altitude environments. "
"46","environment","The abundance of Mycoplasmataceae may reflect changes in the host environment. "
"47","environment","This may be related to the effect of a high-altitude environment on gut microorganisms in amphibians (or in Bg alone). "
"48","environment","Thus, amphibians may obtain these bacteria from the aquatic environment through skin contact (Walke et al., 2014), and high-altitude environments may affect the symbiotic bacteria of amphibians. "
"49","environment","4.2 | High-altitude environments may contribute to the decrease in alpha and beta diversities in symbiotic microbiomes In our study, the observed OTU numbers were lower in both the skin and gut microbiomes of amphibians at high altitude (or in Bg alone), similar to the OTU values observed in humans, pigs, and Chinese rhesus macaques at high and low altitudes (Zeng et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018). "
"50","environment","The environment can affect symbiotic microbial diversity (skin and gut microbes) in amphibians (Chang et al., 2016; Wolz, F I G U R E 3  The alpha diversity of symbiotic microbiomes from Bufo gargarizans and amphibians living at different altitudes. "
"51","environment","Thus, higher altitudes represent a complex natural selective pressure on the symbiotic microbiomes present in animals and the environment. "
"52","environment","Therefore, high-altitude environments may be an important selective pressure on the symbiotic microbiomes of amphibians. "
"53","environment","4.3 | Predicted functions of symbiotic bacteria may reflect adaptations to high-altitude environments The symbiotic microbiomes (skin and gut microbiomes) detected in Bg and the other amphibians at high altitudes likely have convergent functions. "
"54","environment","Biofilm formation may be a protective mechanism through which bacteria can withstand extreme environments (low temperature, low or high pH, and strong ultraviolet light exposure) and reproduce (César, Fany, Lucía, & Robert, 2013; Stoodley, Sauer, Davies, & costerton JW, 2002). "
"55","environment","Therefore, it is possible that high-altitude, skin-residing microorganisms adapt to the extreme environment of the plateau by forming a biofilm (Schommer & Gallo, 2013). "
"56","environment","These results show that the H-S-Bg microbiome had high oxygen tolerance and could adapt well to the low-oxygen environment at high altitude. "
"57","environment","The primary focus of this study was to assess the bacterial skin and gut compositions of high-altitude amphibians and their importance in the ability of amphibians to adapt to this extreme environment. "
"58","environment","However, these results could also improve the understanding of theoretical basis for other studies to evaluate adaptation to extreme environments. "
"59","environment","We found that the skin microbiome of Bg living at high altitudes had more bacterial groups from the surrounding aquatic environment than the skin microbes of L-Bg and the gut microbes of L-Bg and H-Bg had. "
"60","environment","We speculate that this may be related to the preference of Bg for the aquatic environment at high altitudes. "
"61","environment","These features may play a role in the environmental adaptation of amphibians. "
