"2","wild","Here, to study the potential relationship of the symbiotic microbiomes of wild amphibians with altitude, we collected the gut and skin samples from frogs (nine species) and the environmental samples (water and soil samples) from the Leshan Mountains (altitude: 360–410 m) and Gongga Mountains (altitude: 3340–3989 m) on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. "
"3","wild","In the future, to improve our understanding of this interaction in wild species, additional ecological factors that may contribute to this phenomenon should be investigated, such as host taxonomy, behavior, and physiology (e.g., habitat selection, life history, phylogeny, and feeding behavior).

"7","adaptation","Further study is required to determine whether these characteristics favor high-altitude amphibian adaptation to extreme environments. "

"10","adaptation","Symbiotic bacteria (i.e., gut and skin microbes) play essential roles in regulating amphibians’ capacity for environmental adaptation (Chang, Huang, Lin, Huang, & Liao, 2016). "
"11","adaptation","4.3 | Predicted functions of symbiotic bacteria may reflect adaptations to high-altitude environments The symbiotic microbiomes (skin and gut microbiomes) detected in Bg and the other amphibians at high altitudes likely have convergent functions. "
"12","adaptation","However, these results could also improve the understanding of theoretical basis for other studies to evaluate adaptation to extreme environments. "
"13","adaptation","These features may play a role in the environmental adaptation of amphibians. "
