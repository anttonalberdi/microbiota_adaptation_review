"1","wild","In this study, we found that caspase-14/ mice show enhanced antibacterial response compared to wild-type mice when challenged with bacteria. "
"2","wild","Therefore, we compared the microbial communities between wild-type and caspase-14/ mice by sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. "
"3","wild","Although both wild-type and caspase-14/ skin were dominated by the Firmicutes phylum, the Staphylococcaceae family was reduced in caspase-14/ mice. "
"4","wild","The caspase-14/ skin showed disturbance in the microflora under static conditions, manifested in a more heterogeneous bacterial composition compared to wild-type mice. "
"5","wild","After birth, wild-type and caspase14/ female mice were housed together, and after weaning (at the age of 3 weeks), they were kept for 6 weeks in separate cages. "
"6","wild","The differential abundance of each taxonomic unit between wild-type and caspase-14 deficient samples was tested using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test (P-value), corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini– Hochberg false discovery rate (q-value). "
"7","wild","Hence, we investigated whether there was a difference in antimicrobial activity between caspase-14 deficient and wild-type skin. "
"8","wild","No antimicrobial activity was observed in the skin of unchallenged wild-type and caspase14/ animals (Fig. "
"9","wild","However, after stimulation of the skin with E. coli in a Finn chamber model, caspase-14 deficient skin showed stronger bactericidal activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) (Fig. 1a) and against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) than wild-type skin (Fig. 1b and c). "
"10","wild","The caspase-14/ skin microbiome differs from the wildtype hairless skin microbiota The RDA experiments suggest that the dermal microbiome of caspase-14 knockout skin is capable to mount an enhanced antimicrobial reaction. "
"11","wild","The skin of wildtype and caspase-14/ mice was colonized mainly by the phylum Firmicutes, with a minor contribution of Proteobacteria (Fig. 2a). "
"12","wild","The higher microbial diversity in caspase-14 deficient mice compared to wild-type mice was reflected by detection of significant overrepresentation of other, relatively low-abundant phyla, such as ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. "
"13","wild","By rarefying the metagenomic samples at different taxonomic levels, we found that wild-type skin consistently displayed a lowered taxa richness than caspase-14/ skin with respect to family (P = 0.014), genus (P = 0.013) and OTU (P = 0.037) level (Fig. 2b and Fig. "
"14","wild","Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) performed at the family level showed a strong clustering of the wild-type group, with a very low variation (Fig. 2c). "
"15","wild","By contrast, caspase14/ samples were clearly different from the tight wild-type cluster and showed a strong variation and low correlation among samples, a finding that was confirmed by a PCoA on OTU and genera abundances (Fig. "
"16","wild","The composition of the KO1 microbiome was very similar to the wild-type group. "
"17","wild","The clustering of wild-type microbiota was similarly pronounced at the OTU level, while the knockout group showed no consistent clustering on all taxonomic levels and a higher within group dispersion. "
"18","wild","As the KO sample dispersion was still higher in the KO group (P = 0.031 and P = 0.0503, respectively, beta dispersion test), our conclusion is that the Staphylococacceae are different between WT and KO group and that the Staphylococacceae community shows more variance in caspase 14/ than wild-type mice skin. "
"19","wild","The dermal microflora of caspase-14/ hairless mice has a significantly reduced abundance of the Staphylococcaceae and is enriched in transient bacteria The 16S sequence analysis revealed that 13 bacterial families significantly differed between wild-type and caspase-14/ group (P < 0.05, q < 0.1). "
"20","wild","The skin of wild-type and caspase-14/ mice was colonized mainly by staphylococci; however, the Staphylococcaceae family was significantly reduced (P = 0.016, q = 0.05) in caspase-14/ skin. "
"21","wild","Increased bactericidal activity in caspase-14/ skin challenged with E. coli. (a) Escherichia coli-killing activity in washings of skin from wild-type and caspase-14/ mice stimulated with E. coli ATCC 11775. "
"22","wild","The caspase-14/ microbiome is in mild dysbiotic state. (a) Skin microbiome composition of wild-type (n = 5) and caspase-14/ (n = 4) at the phylum level. "
"23","wild","The means of five independent rarefactions of five wild-type and four caspase-14/ samples are shown. (c) PCoA analysis of family abundance in wild-type and caspase-14/ samples. "
"24","wild","The inset shows the distribution of the weighted correlation among all wild-type and all caspase-14/ samples. "
"25","wild","Red, wild-type samples; blue, caspase-14/ samples. (a) (b) Figure 3. "
"26","wild","The dermal microflora of caspase-14/ skin is enriched in transient bacteria. (a) Boxplot of families with a significantly different abundance in wildtype and caspase-14/ skin samples, shown on a log10 scale. "
"27","wild","Red – wild-type; blue – caspase-14/. (b) Composition of wild-type (WT, n = 5) and caspase-14/ (KO, n = 4) samples on the family level. "
"28","wild","Although we were unable to detect any antibacterial activity in unchallenged wild-type and caspase-14 deficient skin, possibly due to low sensitivity of the RDA assay, we cannot exclude the possibility that in vivo the antimicrobial activity is altered. "
"29","wild","In general, caspase14 KO showed higher OTU richness than wild-type mice. "
"30","wild","Phylogenetic composition of wild-type and caspase-14/ skin microbiomes. "
"31","adaptation","So far, the most explanations about microbial adaptation to mouse skin habitat seem to be largely speculative. "
"32","inbred","Therefore, more in-depth analyses are needed to provide comprehensive information about the cutaneous microbiome of different inbred mouse strains in different mouse facilities. "
"33","model","However, as a large part of skin research is performed in animal models, it is important to also unravel the role of the skin microbiota in these settings. "
"34","model","Hairless mice have been used as an important dermatological model for many years (32,33). "
"35","model","However, after stimulation of the skin with E. coli in a Finn chamber model, caspase-14 deficient skin showed stronger bactericidal activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) (Fig. 1a) and against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) than wild-type skin (Fig. 1b and c). "
"36","knockout","Materials and methods Animals Caspase-14 knockout mice were generated as described (24) and back crossed to the outbred SKH-1 Hrhr/Hrhr strain. "
"37","knockout","Separation of caspase-14 knockout skin washing fluids by preparative C8 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and analysis of RP-HPLC fractions for bactericidal activity confirmed the presence of bactericidal activity against E. coli. "
"38","knockout","The caspase-14/ skin microbiome differs from the wildtype hairless skin microbiota The RDA experiments suggest that the dermal microbiome of caspase-14 knockout skin is capable to mount an enhanced antimicrobial reaction. "
"39","knockout","The clustering of wild-type microbiota was similarly pronounced at the OTU level, while the knockout group showed no consistent clustering on all taxonomic levels and a higher within group dispersion. "
"40","knockout","In addition, unknown bacteria, classified to the Staphylococcaceae family, but neither Staphylococcus sp., nor the Bacillales order were significantly underrepresented in caspase-14 knockout mice. "
"41","knockout","The observed shift in the bacterial composition of caspase-14/ samples showed that the main families that varied in the knockout group belong to the Proteobacteria division (Fig. 3a). "
"42","knockout","Apparently, the transient bacteria are harboured in the knockout skin due to stochastic factors such as the presence of these bacteria in the air, food and/or bedding (47). "
"43","knockout","Indeed, we found a significant enrichment in Proteobacteria (although the relative abundance is still low) on the drier caspase-14 knockout skin, which is deficient in natural moisturizing factors. "
