"2","wild","Binder2,8 Abstract Background: Non-invasive biomarkers can facilitate health assessments in wild primate populations by reducing the need for direct access to animals. "
"3","wild","In this study, we collected urine samples across three platyrrhine families including small captive populations of Leontopithecus rosalia and Pithecia pithecia, and larger wild populations of Leontocebus weddelli, Saguinus imperator, Alouatta seniculus, and Plecturocebus toppini, to evaluate a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of urinary neopterin in platyrrhines. "
"4","wild","Results: Our results revealed measured UNC fell within the sensitivity range of the assay in all urine samples collected from captive and wild platyrrhine study species via commercial ELISA, and results from several dilutions met expectations. "
"5","wild","Most notably, we observed higher UNC in the wild population of L. weddelli which is known to have two filarial nematode infections compared to S. imperator, which only have one. "
"6","wild","Conclusion: Our study confirms that neopterin is measurable via commercial ELISA in urine collected from captive and wild individuals of six genera of platyrrhines across three different families. "
"7","wild","Keywords: Neopterin, Health monitoring, Platyrrhines, Immune function, Biomarker Background Health and disease monitoring in wildlife has an important role in modern conservation efforts [1, 2]. "
"8","wild","Identifying health trends and evaluating disease prevalence and onset not only allows for the prevention of disease transmission to threatened populations, but also enhances our understanding of naturally occurring pathogen tolerance and susceptibility in wild populations. "
"9","wild","Evaluating the health status of wildlife allows researchers to anticipate the likelihood of disease outbreaks and infection as well as predict survival outcomes on an individual basis [3]. "
"10","wild","There are two general approaches to assessing wildlife health. "
"11","wild","Because the maintenance of a well-functioning immune system is critical to survival and resistance to infection based on human research [31], neopterin is a promising method of evaluating risk factors for disease transmission in threatened wildlife populations as well. "
"12","wild","These factors make UNC an ideal indicator for the immune status of wild nonhuman primate populations. "
"13","wild","Urinary neopterin, which can be sampled with relative ease, has successfully been tested as an indicator of immune system activation in four non-human primate species over eight studies, five of which were in wild populations [3, 36, 37, 39–43]. "
"14","wild","Behringer et al. [39] found that two populations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) had higher UNC than captive chimpanzees, suggesting that wild populations invest more energy into immune function with respect to captive non-human primates [39]. "
"15","wild","Elevated UNC was recorded in captive bonobos (Pan paniscus) with respiratory infections [40], captive SIV-infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) [41, 42], and during a respiratory outbreak in a wild population of chimpanzees [3]. "
"16","wild","Lohrich et al. [43] found seasonal fluctuation in UNC of wild chimpanzees, with increased levels corresponding to low ambient temperature. "
"17","wild","RE59321, Hamburg, Germany), we successfully detected neopterin in urine samples opportunistically collected from two golden lion tamarins and two white-faced sakis living in captivity, and 40 emperor tamarins, 30 saddleback tamarins, one brown titi monkey, and one Colombian red howler monkey living in the wild. "
"18","wild","We measured lower SG values in the urine of wild species compared to captive species (Table 1); however, null hypothesis statistical tests were inappropriate in this instance due to potential species differences and the small sample size from captive species (n = 7). "
"19","wild","Therefore, we were unable to further explore the significance of these differences between wild and captive individuals. "
"20","wild","We sampled golden lion tamarins and white-faced sakis living in captivity, and wild emperor tamarins, saddleback tamarins, a brown titi monkey, and a Colombian red howler monkey. n denotes number of samples analyzed from each species Sampling location Species n SG at time of collection SG at time of analysis Mean Stdev. "
"21","wild","The variation in SG between the urine samples of captive and wild individuals could be attributed to species differences, although we hypothesize it is more likely due to diet. "
"22","wild","We sampled golden lion tamarins and white-faced sakis living in captivity, and wild living emperor tamarins, saddleback tamarins, a brown titi monkey, and a Colombian red howler monkey. "
"23","wild","Behringer et al. [39] found significant differences between the UNC of captive and wild chimpanzees, attributing this variation to increased immune challenges faced by wild chimpanzees [39]. "
"24","wild","Although we could not perform such comparisons with these data, we believe that comparing the immune status of captive and wild platyrrhine taxa would be valuable in the future. "
"25","wild","Longitudinal, repeated sampling from individuals across multiple seasons can facilitate the establishment of baseline UNC for populations to explore trends that have been observed in wild catarrhines, such as immunosenescence [36] and elevated UNC during disease outbreak [3]. "
"26","wild","Our power calculations indicate that minimum sample sizes per species from either the wild or captivity are 14 (β = 0.8, α = .05), a difficult standard to achieve across multiple genera due to the limited number of animals in captivity and the significant differences between captive conditions across these individuals. "
"27","wild","Their findings, coupled with our preliminary findings indicating higher measured UNC in L. weddelli, which have known higher blood parasite infection in these populations, suggests that UNC can be used as a measure to evaluate health status and disease outbreaks in wild and captive platyrrhine populations to predict survival outcomes in the future.
