"1","wild","The anhedonic effect of HFD was absent in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice although these animals gained more weight and adiposity in response to HFD than wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","Cg-Lepob/J (ob/ob) mice and C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) through Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). "
"3","wild","Effect of high-fat diet (HFD), relative to control diet (CD), in wild-type (WT) and ob/ob mice on caloric intake per cage (each cage housing 2 mice) (a), caloric intake per body weight (b), body weight (c), epididymal fat weight (d), behavior in the open field (OF) test (e,f), behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test (g,h), behavior in the light-dark (L/D) box test (i,j), sucrose preference (k) and behavior in the splash test (l).

"
"5","model","Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression [8,9], and comprehension of the mechanisms underlying anhedonia in animal models of obesity may explain the interrelationship between obesity and depression. "
"6","model","In order to detect any interference of ABT with dietrelated metabolic changes, we performed OPLS-DA models on sub-samples obtained either from mice receiving water (Figure 3(d)) or antibiotics (Figure 3 (e)). "
"7","model","R2Y: [0.7649 0.5692 0.8818 0.4201]; R2Ycum: 0.6590; Q2Y: [0.2584 0.2665 0.5386 0.2094]; Q2cum: 0.3182. (c) Loadings plot derived from the above OPLS-DA model (panel b), describing the metabolic differences driving the separation along the x axis based on the treatment. "
"8","model","Red-circle: control diet; yellow-diamond: HFD; R2Y: 0.7062; Q2Y: 0.0686. (f) Loadings plot derived from OPLS-DA model (panel d) describing the metabolic differences driving the separation between CD and HFD in mice receiving ‘water’. "
"9","model","AMH ran the animal model, the behavioral tests and the PCR and analyzed the pertinent data including those obtained with multiplex immunoassay. "
"10","model","In search of a depressed mouse: utility of models for studying depression-related behavior in genetically modified mice. "
"11","model","Gut microbiome remodeling induces depressive-like behaviors through a pathway mediated by the host’s metabolism. "
