"1","wild","To determine whether these changes are related to the state of biotin deficiency that develops in SMVT-cKO mice, we induced (by dietary means) biotin deficiency in wild-type mice and examined its effect on the abovementioned parameters. "
"2","wild","Similar changes were observed in wild-type (WT) mice made biotin deficient via dietary manipulation but not in cultured intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers maintained in vitro under a chronic biotin-deficient condition. "
"3","wild","WT, wild-type; ZO, zonula occludens; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase. "
"4","model","First published August 4, 2016; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00240.2016.—Utilizing a conditional (intestinal-specific) knockout (cKO) mouse model, we have recently shown that the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) (SLC5A6) is the only biotin uptake system that operates in the gut and that its deletion leads to biotin deficiency. "
"5","model","The relative contribution of the SMVT system toward intestinal carrier-mediated biotin uptake has also been investigated in our laboratory utilizing an in vitro gene-specific silencing (siRNA) approach and human-derived intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells (5) and more recently an in vivo conditional (intestine-specific) SMVT knockout (cKO) mouse model generated utilizing Cre/lox technology (15). "
"6","model","However, during the course of our investigations of the SMVT-cKO mouse model, we unexpectedly came across an interesting observation that all the SMVT-cKO animals (in addition to becoming biotin deficient) also develop Address for reprint requests and other correspondence: H. "
"7","model","Three models were used in this investigation: 1) the SMVT-cKO mouse model (15), 2) a dietary-induced biotin-deficient mouse model, and 3) in vitro cultured intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers maintained under a chronic biotin-deficient condition. "
"8","model","Our aim in this study was to further understand the role of the intestinal biotin transporter (SMVT) in the maintenance of gut mucosal integrity (focusing on permeability and the level of expression of TJ proteins), and for that we used three models: 1) the intestinal SMVT-cKO mouse model, 2) a dietary-induced biotin-deficient mouse model, and 3) an in vitro model of confluent intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers maintained under a biotin-deficient condition. "
"9","model","Further studies with the SMVT-cKO model confirmed what we know about these animals of gut inflammation by showing a marked increase in the level of expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IFN-) in the cecal mucosa. "
"10","model","The results showed that dietary-induced biotin deficiency also leads to the development of chronic active cecal inflammation and focal cryptitis similar to that seen in the SMVT-cKO model, together with an increase in the level of expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IFN-). "
"11","model","Our studies with the third model of in vitro cultured confluent intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers maintained under chronic biotin deficiency showed no changes in epithelial permeability or in the level of expression of TJ proteins. "
"12","model","The latter findings suggest that the effect of biotin deficiency on intestinal mucosal integrity observed in the above-described mouse models is indirect in nature and most likely mediated via an effect of biotin deficiency on other cell types in the intestinal mucosa, like immune cells. "
"13","model","Proinflammatory cytokine-induced tight junction remodeling through dynamic self-assembly of claudins. "
"14","knockout","First published August 4, 2016; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00240.2016.—Utilizing a conditional (intestinal-specific) knockout (cKO) mouse model, we have recently shown that the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) (SLC5A6) is the only biotin uptake system that operates in the gut and that its deletion leads to biotin deficiency. "
"15","knockout","These results show that the intestinal SMVT plays an important role in the maintenance of normal mucosal integrity, most likely via its role in providing biotin to different cells of the gut mucosa. sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter knockout; biotin; mucosal integrity; mucosal inflammation; tight junction proteins NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study presents new findings on the role of the intestinal biotin transporter (sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter) in the maintenance of normal intestinal mucosal integrity and health. "
"16","knockout","The relative contribution of the SMVT system toward intestinal carrier-mediated biotin uptake has also been investigated in our laboratory utilizing an in vitro gene-specific silencing (siRNA) approach and human-derived intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells (5) and more recently an in vivo conditional (intestine-specific) SMVT knockout (cKO) mouse model generated utilizing Cre/lox technology (15). "
"17","knockout","Effect of intestinal sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter conditional knockout (SMVT-cKO) on the level of mRNA expression of IFN- (A) and TNF- (B) in cecal mucosa. "
"18","knockout","Conditional knockout of the Slc5a6 gene in mouse intestine impairs biotin absorption. "
