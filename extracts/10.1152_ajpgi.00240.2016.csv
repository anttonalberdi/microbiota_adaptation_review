"4","model","First published August 4, 2016; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00240.2016.—Utilizing a conditional (intestinal-specific) knockout (cKO) mouse model, we have recently shown that the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) (SLC5A6) is the only biotin uptake system that operates in the gut and that its deletion leads to biotin deficiency. "
"5","model","The relative contribution of the SMVT system toward intestinal carrier-mediated biotin uptake has also been investigated in our laboratory utilizing an in vitro gene-specific silencing (siRNA) approach and human-derived intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells (5) and more recently an in vivo conditional (intestine-specific) SMVT knockout (cKO) mouse model generated utilizing Cre/lox technology (15).

"7","model","Three models were used in this investigation: 1) the SMVT-cKO mouse model (15), 2) a dietary-induced biotin-deficient mouse model, and 3) in vitro cultured intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers maintained under a chronic biotin-deficient condition. "
"8","model","Our aim in this study was to further understand the role of the intestinal biotin transporter (SMVT) in the maintenance of gut mucosal integrity (focusing on permeability and the level of expression of TJ proteins), and for that we used three models: 1) the intestinal SMVT-cKO mouse model, 2) a dietary-induced biotin-deficient mouse model, and 3) an in vitro model of confluent intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers maintained under a biotin-deficient condition. "
"9","model","Further studies with the SMVT-cKO model confirmed what we know about these animals of gut inflammation by showing a marked increase in the level of expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IFN-) in the cecal mucosa. "
"10","model","The results showed that dietary-induced biotin deficiency also leads to the development of chronic active cecal inflammation and focal cryptitis similar to that seen in the SMVT-cKO model, together with an increase in the level of expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IFN-). "
"11","model","Our studies with the third model of in vitro cultured confluent intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers maintained under chronic biotin deficiency showed no changes in epithelial permeability or in the level of expression of TJ proteins. "
