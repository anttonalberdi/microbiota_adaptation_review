"1","wild","However, our understanding of how microbial communities are structured across wildlife populations is poor. "
"2","wild","The quantification of interspecific associations of gut microbes is rare in wildlife populations but, given the significant ecological insights derived from studies of human gut microbial communities (e.g. "
"3","wild","Here, we use a CRF approach to investigate microbial community composition in a wild moose (Alces alces) population in Minnesota. "
"4","wild","Other ecological processes such interspecific associations, even though rarely quantified in wild populations, are also likely to play a role in shaping the moose gut microbial community as they do for other ruminants (Henderson et al., 2015). "
"5","wild","2  | MATERIAL S AND METHODS 2.1 | Sample collection and sequencing Faecal samples were collected from 55 wild moose that were part of companion studies of survival and cause-specific mortality led by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and Voyageur's National Park across north-eastern Minnesota (Figure 1), placed on ice until transportation to the laboratory and stored at −20°C prior to processing. "
"6","wild","Nonetheless, the scale at which wildlife surveillance is performed (and thus faecal samples collected for gut microbiome analysis) is often similar across studies (e.g. "
"7","wild","Studies analysing associations between microbial species are rare in wildlife, even though they can provide important insights into the ecological dynamics operating within or on the host. "
"8","wild","Given the decreasing cost of microbial surveys and analytical advances such as ours, studies that can disentangle microbial community dynamics in wildlife species will become more frequent, and this can ultimately provide a more nuanced understanding of wildlife health. "
