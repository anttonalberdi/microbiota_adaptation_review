"14","model","We examined microbial community dynamics in this population utilizing novel graphical network models that can explicitly incorporate spatial information. "
"15","model","Models only accounting for associations between microbes had higher predictive value compared to models including moose sex, evidence of previous pathogen exposure or body condition. "
"16","model","Adding spatial information on moose location further strengthened our model and allowed us to predict microbe occurrences with ~90% accuracy. "
"17","model","Graphical network models such as conditional random fields (CRFs) offer exciting opportunities to address this challenge by estimating associations between organisms in a community (Clark et al., 2018b). "
"18","model","In effect, these models can untangle relative influences of microbial interspecific associations and host characteristics in predicting community compositions. "
"19","model","Overlaying functional or phylogenetic information onto graphical models has the potential to highlight the broader mechanisms shaping microbial communities. "
"20","model","The approach applied here can be used to quantify interspecific associations and gain a more nuanced understanding of the spatial and host factors shaping microbial communities in non-model hosts. "
"21","model","Do CRF model combinations including host characteristics and spatial proximity outperform models reflecting just associations between microbes in explaining microbial communities? "
"22","model","These particular cut-off values of 10%–75% were chosen because initial model testing revealed that the strong class imbalances for OTUs outside these thresholds hampered the ability of our cross-validation procedures to estimate regression coefficients (i.e. a cross-validation training fold that contains nearly all 0s or all 1s is not informative for estimating effects of predictors and will result in an intercept-only model instead, Galar, Fernandez, Barrenechea, Bustince, & Herrera, 2012). "
"23","model","To test how sensitive our models are to this threshold, we reduced the nMDS threshold to ρ ≥ 0.2 and performed the following analysis again. "
"24","model","Briefly, the log-odds of observing OTU j given covariate x and the presence–absence of OTU k is modelled using: where yj is a vector of binary observations for OTU j (1 if the OTU was present, 0 if absent), y\j represents vectors of binary observations for all other OTUs apart from j, αj0 is the OTU-level intercept, and T j is the coefficient for the effect of covariate x on OTU j's occurrence probability. "
"25","model","For each OTU-specific regression, sparsity is added to the model using L1 (e.g. least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO]) regularization to force regression coefficients towards zero if they have minimal effects. "
"26","model","We repeated this process up to 50,000 times for each regression (with a new random cross-validation split chosen for training in each iteration), ensuring that the data were appropriately covered during model fitting. "
"27","model","2.3.2 | Markov random field and CRF model selection We estimated four graphical model formulations of increasing complexity to identify a best-fitting model for our OTU presence– absence dataset. "
"28","model","In general, the Markov random field (MRF) models do not include covariates, while the CRF models included both the covariates and covariate by OTU interactions as additional predictors. "
"29","model","Furthermore, we performed MRF and CRF routines with and without spatial regression splines giving us a total of four separate models. "
"30","model","In the first, we built a MRF graph that did not include any spatial data or host characteristics and used only the binary occurrences of the 43 OTUs as predictors (hereafter the MRF model). "
"31","model","In the second model, the GPS coordinates for each observation (latitude and longitude, in decimal degrees) were used to construct penalized Gaussian process regression splines with 100 degrees of freedom (Kammann & Wand, 2003; Wood, 2003; hereafter the spatial MRF model). "
"32","model","For the third model, we built a CRF including moose characteristics covariates (moose sex, body condition, pregnancy status and the pathogen exposure PCoA axes) as well as longitude and latitude (hereafter the non-spatial CRF model). "
"33","model","For the final model, we built a CRF as above, but we replaced the latitude and longitude variables with spatial splines (hereafter the spatial CRF model). "
"34","model","We assessed the fit of each of the above candidate models to the observed data by calculating the proportion of observations that each model successfully classified. "
"35","model","This was done using 10-fold cross-validation fitting models to a random fold containing 90% of the data (training data) and predicting OTU occurrence for the remaining 10% (test data). "
"36","model","The best-fitting model was then fit to 100 bootstrapped versions of the observed data (randomly shuffling observations in each bootstrap iteration) to capture uncertainty in model parameters. "
"37","model","All CRF and MRF model fitting was performed using functions in the MrFcov r package (Clark et al., 2018a). "
"38","model","See Appendix S1 for r code detailing data preparation, analytical routine and model specification. "
"39","model","As an additional sensitivity analysis, and to gain further insight into the utility of multivariate community information for predicting changes in microbiota composition, we fit ‘null’ models that only included spatial effects (Gaussian process spatial splines, as in the spatial models above) as well as hostand site-level predictors. "
"40","model","In other words, these null models did not include the presence/absence of other OTUs as predictors. "
"41","model","For each OTU null model, we built LASSO logistic regressions that used 10-fold cross-validation as above to identify appropriate LASSO penalties. "
"42","model","We predicted binary occurrences using the resulting model fits and calculated predictive metrics as above for the entire dataset (2,184 observations). "
"43","model","3.1 | Model fit The MRF model, which only quantified associations between microbes, could more accurately predict OTU occurrence compared to either the spatial CRF or non-spatial CRF models (both of which included host characteristics; Figure 2a). "
"44","model","Including spatial regression splines did improve the fit of the CRF model, with this model accurately predicting 78% of observations compared to 74% of for the non-spatial CRF (Figure 2a). "
"45","model","This result was not due to one model being better able to predict occurrence over absence, as the MRF had much higher specificity and sensitivity than either of the CRF models (Figure 2b,c). "
"46","model","However, we still found evidence of spatial clustering in microbial occurrence probabilities, as MRF performance improved further when we included spatial splines in the model (Figure 2a). "
"47","model","Adding spatial data to this model enabled us to correctly predict ~90% of the OTU occurrences for our subset of the moose gut microbial community. "
"48","model","This not only suggests that microbes in our dataset were more likely to show similar occurrences in moose that were sampled nearby to one another, but that false associations between microbes could be inferred by models that do not account for spatial proximity. "
"49","model","As the models including 43 OTUs were easier to visualize, we present those results herein. "
"50","model","The null models, which only included spatial effects as well as hostand site-level predictors (e.g. did not include other OTUs as predictors), had substantially lower predictive power than models that included microbial interspecific associations. "
"51","model","For the null model, the proportion of true predictions was 67.3%–71.3%. "
"52","model","This drop in performance was primarily due to a loss of sensitivity (65.0%, compared to 78% for the worst-performing community model; Appendix S1; Figure 2). "
"53","model","Specificity for the null model was on par with the CRF models at 73.3%, but this was still much lower than the MRF models (Appendix S1; Figure 2). "
"54","model","F I G U R E 2   Box-and-whisker plots showing the predictive performance of the Markov random field model (MRF—without model covariates), spatial MRF model, non-spatial conditional random field model (CRF—with model covariates) and spatial CRF as defined by (a) true prediction performance, (b) specificity and (c) sensitivity. "
"55","model","Predictions were assessed by fitting models to a random fold containing 90% of the data (training data) and predicting operational taxonomic unit (OTU) occurrence for the remaining 10% (test data). "
"56","model","This process was repeated 100 times to capture uncertainty in each model. "
"57","model","Specificity is the ability of the model to correctly identify individual moose without the specified OTU (proportion of observed negatives that were predicted to be negative), while sensitivity is the ability to correctly identify individuals with the specified OTU (proportion of observed positives that were predicted to be positive). "
"58","model","4  | DISCUSSION Utilizing graphical network models, we show the importance of microbial interspecific associations over some host characteristics in shaping moose gut microbial communities at a population scale. "
"59","model","Our study not only highlights the importance of accounting for interspecific associations when trying to quantify how host characteristics shapes host microbial community but also shows the value of graphical network models in untangling community dynamics more broadly. "
"60","model","Even without accounting for host traits such as host genetics that are thought to be important in shaping the gut microbial communities in other herbivores (Kohl, Varner, Wilkening, & Dearing, 2018), our models had high predictive performance. "
"61","model","When we increased the number of OTUs, we included in the model the relative importance of interspecific associations compared to host traits did not vary (Appendix S2). "
"62","model","Future studies linking host microbial data to measures of host diet, such as stable isotope analysis (Hofman-Kamińska, Bocherens, Borowik, Drucker, & Kowalczyk, 2018), will enable dispersal limitation and diet to be decoupled in future models. "
"63","model","Here, we have demonstrated that graphical network models can untangle how interspecific interactions can shape gut microbial communities in moose. "
"64","model","Additionally, we show that MRF and CRF models can robustly construct co-occurrence networks (Clark et al., 2018b) and, coupled with taxonomic and functional information, find high-resolution insights into interspecific associations. "
"65","model","Graphical network models, as with other correlation-based approaches, do have limitations. "
"66","model","Follow-up analysis with tools such as structural equation modelling (SEM) could be used to go beyond correlations to explore potential causal relationships between microbes (Banerjee et al., 2018). "
"67","model","Nonetheless, by explicitly incorporating spatial data and covariates into graphical models, our method offers a step forward in characterizing associations between species, and we envisage this method will be broadly useful for researchers working on microand macro-community dynamics alike.
