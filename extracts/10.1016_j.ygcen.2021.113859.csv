"2","wild","However, habituation of wildlife for ecotourism can cause long-term elevation of glucocorticoid hormones, which may suppress immune function and increase an animal’s vulnerability to disease. "
"3","wild","While an acute rise in glucocorticoids can be part of an adaptive physiological response to a stressor (which habituation to human presence likely presents for wild-living animals, e. g. "
"4","wild","We found no relationship between FGCMs and age-sex category, sex, season, mean daily temperature or rainfall in the gorillas (Shutt et al., 2014) using the same data we analyze here, but other factors such as food availability, predation risk and other environmental conditions could affect glucocorticoid homeostasis (Presley et al., 1996; Monello et al., 2010), however, these data are difficult to obtain especially in the wild animals. "
"5","wild","Ecological factors, such as seasonal influence on parasite richness, might be more relevant than physiological factors as fecal glucocorticoid levels, which was shown also in wild white-handed gibbons (Gillespie et al., 2013). "

"18","fitness","Barja et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2020; Palme, 2019; Shutt et al., 2012), chronically elevated glucocorticoid output is linked to pathology, reduced fitness and increased mortality (Boonstra and Fox, 2013; Cyr and Romero, 2007; McEwen, 1998; Pride, 2005; Sapolsky et al., 2000; Selye, 1955; Wingfield and Romero, 2010).
