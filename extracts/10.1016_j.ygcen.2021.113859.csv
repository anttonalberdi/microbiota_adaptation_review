"1","wild","Research paper Fecal glucocorticoids and gastrointestinal parasite infections in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) involved in ecotourism Kathryn Shutt-Phillips a,b,1, Barbora Pafčo c,d,1,*, Michael Heistermann e, Adetayo Kasim f, Klára J. "
"2","wild","However, habituation of wildlife for ecotourism can cause long-term elevation of glucocorticoid hormones, which may suppress immune function and increase an animal’s vulnerability to disease. "
"3","wild","While an acute rise in glucocorticoids can be part of an adaptive physiological response to a stressor (which habituation to human presence likely presents for wild-living animals, e. g. "
"4","wild","We found no relationship between FGCMs and age-sex category, sex, season, mean daily temperature or rainfall in the gorillas (Shutt et al., 2014) using the same data we analyze here, but other factors such as food availability, predation risk and other environmental conditions could affect glucocorticoid homeostasis (Presley et al., 1996; Monello et al., 2010), however, these data are difficult to obtain especially in the wild animals. "
"5","wild","Ecological factors, such as seasonal influence on parasite richness, might be more relevant than physiological factors as fecal glucocorticoid levels, which was shown also in wild white-handed gibbons (Gillespie et al., 2013). "

"18","fitness","Barja et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2020; Palme, 2019; Shutt et al., 2012), chronically elevated glucocorticoid output is linked to pathology, reduced fitness and increased mortality (Boonstra and Fox, 2013; Cyr and Romero, 2007; McEwen, 1998; Pride, 2005; Sapolsky et al., 2000; Selye, 1955; Wingfield and Romero, 2010). "
"19","model","We chose a negative binomial model (Hilbe, 2007) to test the association between our independent variable, FGCM levels, and our two outcome variables, egg counts of Necator/Oesophagostumum spp. and Mammomonogamus sp. because of its robustness to over-dispersion. "
"20","model","We tested for effects of age-sex category, sex and season for Makumba group in one model, and for effects of age-sex category (silverback vs. other) and season for Mata group in a second model. "
"21","model","To account for season, we converted the date of sample collection to radian time by dividing each date by 365.25 (the number of days in a year) and then multiplying by 2*π before taking the sine and the cosine of the resulting values, and including these in the model. "
"22","model","Although there were zero values in the outcome data (Necator/Oesophagostumum spp. and Mammomonogamus sp. egg counts), a zero-inflated negative binomial model failed to converge so we report the results of the negative binomial model. "
"23","model","The results could be impacted by variables included in the model. "
"24","model","For example, radian time seems to be a best approach to modeling season (Gillespie et al., 2013), however, a significant number of studies includes wet vs. dry seasons as a binary variable in the model (e.g. "
