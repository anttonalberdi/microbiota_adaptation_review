"3","wild","While an acute rise in glucocorticoids can be part of an adaptive physiological response to a stressor (which habituation to human presence likely presents for wild-living animals, e. g. "
"4","wild","We found no relationship between FGCMs and age-sex category, sex, season, mean daily temperature or rainfall in the gorillas (Shutt et al., 2014) using the same data we analyze here, but other factors such as food availability, predation risk and other environmental conditions could affect glucocorticoid homeostasis (Presley et al., 1996; Monello et al., 2010), however, these data are difficult to obtain especially in the wild animals.

"18","fitness","Barja et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2020; Palme, 2019; Shutt et al., 2012), chronically elevated glucocorticoid output is linked to pathology, reduced fitness and increased mortality (Boonstra and Fox, 2013; Cyr and Romero, 2007; McEwen, 1998; Pride, 2005; Sapolsky et al., 2000; Selye, 1955; Wingfield and Romero, 2010). "
"19","model","We chose a negative binomial model (Hilbe, 2007) to test the association between our independent variable, FGCM levels, and our two outcome variables, egg counts of Necator/Oesophagostumum spp. and Mammomonogamus sp. because of its robustness to over-dispersion. "
"20","model","We tested for effects of age-sex category, sex and season for Makumba group in one model, and for effects of age-sex category (silverback vs. other) and season for Mata group in a second model. "
"21","model","To account for season, we converted the date of sample collection to radian time by dividing each date by 365.25 (the number of days in a year) and then multiplying by 2*π before taking the sine and the cosine of the resulting values, and including these in the model. "
"22","model","Although there were zero values in the outcome data (Necator/Oesophagostumum spp. and Mammomonogamus sp. egg counts), a zero-inflated negative binomial model failed to converge so we report the results of the negative binomial model. "
"23","model","The results could be impacted by variables included in the model. "
"24","model","For example, radian time seems to be a best approach to modeling season (Gillespie et al., 2013), however, a significant number of studies includes wet vs. dry seasons as a binary variable in the model (e.g. "

"26","disease","However, habituation of wildlife for ecotourism can cause long-term elevation of glucocorticoid hormones, which may suppress immune function and increase an animal’s vulnerability to disease. "
"27","disease","Animals subject to habituation may therefore have increased susceptibility to diseases (Hofer and East, 1998; Hudson et al., 1992; Meder, 1994; Woodford et al., 2002). "
"28","disease","Although we did not find direct relationship between FGCM levels and strongylid infections, the results of our comparison across groups suggest that the animals in the habituation process are more susceptible to diseases or have a reduced ability to regulate parasite infection. "

"
"34","environment","Prevalence of strongylid nematodes reaches 100 % (Pafčo et al., 2017), gorillas live in a contaminated environment and thus they keep encountering the infection throughout their life. "
"35","environment","We found no relationship between FGCMs and age-sex category, sex, season, mean daily temperature or rainfall in the gorillas (Shutt et al., 2014) using the same data we analyze here, but other factors such as food availability, predation risk and other environmental conditions could affect glucocorticoid homeostasis (Presley et al., 1996; Monello et al., 2010), however, these data are difficult to obtain especially in the wild animals. "
"36","environment","In contrast, Necator/Oesophagostumum spp. are strongly affected by seasonal variation and host age-sex category (this study, Pafčo et al., 2017), suggesting that environmental factors or host traits have a stronger influence on strongylid infections than on FGCM levels. "
"37","environment","However, the unknown prepatent period for the parasites we studied complicates the evaluation of seasonal variation, which is connected to development of the parasite stages in the external environment (Anderson, 2000). "
"38","environment","We evaluated the relationship between parasite infections and glucocorticoid hormones in wild groups of western lowland gorillas inhabiting the same environment but at different levels of habituation. "
"39","human","Our findings partially support the hypothesis that elevated glucocorticoids reduce a host’s ability to control the extent of parasitic infections, and show the importance of non-invasive monitoring of endocrine function and parasite infection in individuals exposed to human pressure including habituation process and ecotourism. "
"40","human","Wildlife must often be habituated to human presence before ecotourism activities can commence. "

"42","human","While an acute rise in glucocorticoids can be part of an adaptive physiological response to a stressor (which habituation to human presence likely presents for wild-living animals, e. g. "
"43","human","Several studies have tested the hypothesis that increased glucocorticoid output is associated with parasite infections in non-human primates, with various results. "
"44","human","In line with this, we have previously shown that a group of gorillas undergoing habituation for ecotourism had significantly higher fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGCM) levels than a well-habituated group, and both these groups had higher FGCMs than gorillas that were not habituated or followed by humans (Shutt et al., 2014). "
"45","human","The relationship we found between age-sex category and parasite infection is well documented in other non-human primates (e.g., Miller, 1960; Müller-Graf et al., 1996). "
"46","human","Our results also reflect observed patterns of seasonality in parasite infection in other non-human primates (MacIntosh et al., 2010; Setchell et al., 2010; Masi et al., 2012; Trejo-Macias and Estrada, 2012), and support our previous study (Pafčo et al., 2017). "
"47","human","Elevated glucocorticoids contribute to immune suppression in humans and animals (Råberg et al., 1998; Sapolsky, 1998; Sapolsky et al., 2000), and some studies demonstrate a specific immunosuppressive effect of steroid hormones resulting in increased parasite infections (Klein, 2004; Zuk and McKean, 1996). "
"48","human","Theoretically, parasites could be also introduced to gorillas by humans due to close contact (Sak et al., 2013), but the observed transmission patterns of strongylid nematodes between gorillas and humans in DSPA seem to be due to sharing a habitat rather than close contact during the habituation or ecotourism (Pafčo et al., 2019). "
"49","human","According our results, the parasite infections start to increase when a gorilla group undergoes habituation and is contacted more often by human observers, when they also have higher FGCMs, then both parasites and FGCMs decrease when the group is habituated and ignores humans. "
