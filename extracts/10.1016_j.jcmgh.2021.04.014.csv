"5","model","METHODS: To examine impact of dietary fibers on development of type 1 diabetes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous non-obese diabetes (NOD) models, mice were fed grain-based chow (GBC) or compositionally defined diets enriched with a fermentable fiber (inulin) or an insoluble fiber (cellulose). "
"6","model","Numerous studies of humans and animal models indicate that dietary fiber can modulate gut microbiota and ameliorate aspects of metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance.8–11 Metabolic benefits of fiber, particularly those provided by soluble fibers, result, at least in part, from them being fermented by gut bacteria. "
"7","model","Although T1D is primarily driven by destruction of pancreatic b cells, insulin sensitivity also impacts disease severity.13 Hence, we tested the potential of fermentable fiber to ameliorate T1D using 2 well-established models of this disease, namely the highly tractable streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous genetic non-obese diabetes (NOD) mouse models. "
"8","model","We observed a striking potential for fermentable fiber to prevent and treat STZ-induced diabetes and to delay diabetes development in the NOD model. "
"9","model","Such protection in the STZ model required gut microbiota, fermentation, and IL22, which, by itself, was able to ameliorate diabetes development.Results Enrichment of Diet With Fermentable Fiber Protects Against STZ-Induced Diabetes An important consideration in diet-based research is selection of a control diet. "
"10","model","However, this commonly used CDD has a total fiber content of only 5%, which is composed entirely of insoluble fiber, cellulose, thus supporting its use as a low-fiber diet.11,16,18 The alkylating agent STZ is highly and preferentially toxic to pancreatic b cells, enabling daily low-dose STZ treatment to serve as a model of T1D.19 Accordingly, subjecting GBC-fed C57BL/6 mice to 5 daily injections of STZ resulted in a marked sustained hyperglycemia (Figure 1A and B). "
"11","model","These results suggest that gut bacteria may play a role in promoting STZ-induced dysglycemia and, more unequivocally, indicate that microbiota are needed for inulin’s protection in this model. "
"12","model","To test this notion, we used the NOD model characterized by this mouse strain’s sporadic and rapid development of diabetes that occurs from 12 to 30 weeks of age in various studies. "
"13","model","3Discussion The central finding reported herein is that nourishing intestinal microbiota via provision of the fermentable fiber inulin resulted in protection in 2 experimental models of T1D. "
"14","model","Specifically, while fermentable fiber provides a benefit in T2D by ameliorating the central defining feature of this disease, namely insulin resistance, inulin’s protection against STZ-induced diabetes associated with preservation of pancreatic b cells, whose loss is the central pathogenic event in T1D.24 Furthermore, the beneficial impacts offermentable fiber on glycemic control in T2D models are highly intertwined with mitigating other central features of metabolic syndrome, especially adiposity.25 In contrast, in the STZ model, consumption of inulin resulted in markedly improved glycemic control while maintaining body mass. "
"15","model","This suggests that preservation of normoglycemia in the STZ model may be a relatively proximal consequence of consumption of fermentable fiber and, in any case, is clearly not dependent on reducing adiposity. "
"16","model","That inulin protected against STZ-induced hyperglycemia while preserving body mass provides a readily appreciable health benefit in this disease model. "
"17","model","In contrast, in the STZ-induced diabetes model, fiber not only improved diagnostic markers of disease but also clearly made the STZ-treated mice healthier in that it ameliorated overt clinical-type disease features such as excessive thirst/ urination and wasting despite hyperphagia that often result in death if untreated. "
"18","model","Inulin’s prevention of b cell loss in the STZ model suggests potential to reduce development of T1D in scenarios wherein b cells are challenged by environmental stressors. "
"19","model","Indeed, a growing list of environmental chemicals that humans encounter (eg, persistent organic pollutants) are reported to damage or destroy b cells and/or impede insulin secretion in model systems.26,27 Accordingly, persons with higher exposures to organic pollutants display lower insulin secretion after glucose challenge.28 Increased exposures to such chemicals mirror the steadily rising incidence of T1D inchildren.29,30 Although mechanisms by which fiber might protect b cells are unclear, that inulin’s protection against STZ-induced diabetes associated with and required IL22 suggests a potential role for regenerating islet III (Reg3) b and g proteins, which are highly induced by IL22 and can prevent loss of b cells.31,32 Such a role for Reg3 proteins accords with recent appreciation that they can act as gutderived hormones.33 Consequently, whether Reg3 proteins produced in response to IL22 in the intestine are transported to the pancreas and impact b cells therein warrants investigation. "
"20","model","The notion that IL22 has broad metabolic consequences comports with our previous finding that this cytokine is required for inulin’s protection against WSD-induced metabolic syndrome11 and findings by others that exogenously administered IL22 results in metabolic improvements in WSD-fed and leptin-deficient mice.34 The ability of IL22 to protect against hyperglycemia in T1D and T2D models reflects that despite their differences, there are Figure 11. "
"21","model","Alterations in gut microbiota strongly associate with both T1D and T2D and may be an important determinant of disease development.35 Accordingly, in models of both, inulin’s protection against disease was fully eliminated by antibiotics, indicating a role for microbiota. "
"22","model","A stable beneficial host-microbiota relationship is proposed to protect against T2D by minimizing low-grade inflammation, which can promote insulin resistance.37 That the inulin-enriched diet decreased splenic neutrophils and increased sensitivity to insulin suggests that mitigating low-grade systemic inflammation, andconsequently insulin resistance, may contribute to its protection in the STZ model. "
"23","model","That blockade of fermentation with hops b-acids reduced inulin’s protection against STZ-induced hyperglycemia indicates an important role for fermentation in mediating the beneficial effects of this in this T1D model. "
"24","model","Moreover, we find that SCFA lack ability to induce IL22 in an ex vivo model (administration of mmol/L levels of SCFA to an ILC3 cell line did not by itself induce IL22 or enhance the amount of IL22 elicited by IL23). "
"25","model","The sporadic nature of diabetes development in the NOD model makes mechanistic studies more challenging. "
"26","model","In addition and/or alternatively, such dampening of inflammation might alter the nature or kinetics of the adaptive immune response that drives the destruction of b cells in this model. "
"27","model","For inducing diabetic models, 5-week-old mice (or at indicated age) were fed with GBC or specified CDDs for 1 week and then intraperitoneally (IP) injected with 50 mg/kg STZ for 5 consecutive days as previously described.46 For antibiotic treatment, mice were fed with indicated CDDs and drinking water containing ampicillin (1 g/L), vancomycin (0.2 g/L), neomycin (1 g/L), and metronidazole (1 g/L) for 1 week before treatments of STZ.
