"2","wild","While the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of several wild Amazonian fish species have been documented (Cooke et al. 2012a,b,c,d, 2014), their resident bacterial genomes have never been investigated and the extent to which fish bacterial communities change along the hydrochemical gradients in Amazonia is still unknown. "
"3","wild","We used a metabarcoding approach targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S gene to analyze the gut and skin mucus bacterial communities of 43 wild flag cichlids, 32 black piranhas, and seven water samples, collected at seven sampling sites encompassing both water colors. "

"5","wild","It is paramount to study wild fish bacterial consortia, as they evolve in complex environments shaped by water physicochemical parameters, trophic networks and biotic/abiotic disturbances, which are documented to drive microbiota compositional shifts (reviewed in Ghanbari et al. 2015) in controlled conditions.

"8","wild","All rights reserved. (2015) did not detect any parallel evolution in the microbiota of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), neither in the wild nor following dietary manipulation. "
"9","wild","Conclusion This study showed that wild Amazonian fish bacterial communities are significantly restructured by the hydrochemical gradients encompassing the black and white waters of Amazonia. "
"10","adaptat","Fish bacterial communities contain an important genetic heritage essential for their hosts' survival, and are also involved in adaptive divergence via niche adaptation processes, but the extent to which they evolve in response to hydrochemical gradients in Amazonia is unknown. "

"
"13","adaptat","Thus, there is a potentially extensive functional genes pool, fundamental to the survival and adaptation of host-microbiota metaorganisms (also termed ""holobionts""), that is comprised in the genomes of host-associated bacteria (Margulis and Fester 1991). "

"
"15","adaptat","Parallelisms and community adaptation Biological communities overcome short-term or stochastic pressures by acclimation (i.e. physiological adaptation), whereas continuous or predictable pressures can be met by community adaptation (i.e. genetically determined response) (Bradshaw and Hardwick 1989; Davison and Pearson 1996; DeAngelis et al. "
"16","adaptat","Positive selection for a certain trait in a given environment can shed light on the adaptation mechanisms of species exploiting this environment. "

"
"28","environment","Taxonomical structures of bacterial communities from both host species were significantly correlated to the environmental continua of magnesium, sodium, dissolved organic carbon, calcium, dissolved O2, pH, potassium, hardness and chloride. "
"29","environment","This colossal fish diversity is found throughout a spectrum of hydrochemically contrasted black and white water environments (Sioli, 1984). "

"
"33","environment","Multiple (thus unpredictable) states may also be possible, stemming from feedbacks between species or species‐environment interactions (Scheffer et al. "
"34","environment","We hypothesized that intra and interspecific convergence in bacterial community structure exist among fish found in the same water color, as we expect the same bacterial taxa to be positively selected in similar environments with comparable selection pressures (Conte et al. "
"35","environment","Overall, our results showed a significant response of bacterial communities from both host species to the hydrochemical gradients, comprising a continuum of 10 environmental physicochemical parameters. "
"36","environment","Contrastingly, the gut community was only correlated to with significantly weaker average Spearman correlations one parameter: environmental pH. "
"37","environment","These metrics highlight two discriminative architectural particularities of these networks: (1) there is an increased connectivity between ASVs of the gut community; and (2) there is a higher modularity of community interactions in the gut tissue, compared to the skin mucus environment. "
"38","environment","Thus, our results highlight the presence of ubiquitous and relatively abundant core taxa, specific to a water color, for which the abundances are positively selected in the environment (fish tissue) where they are core. "
"39","environment","Furthermore, we identified four bacterial taxa in the skin mucus, and one taxa in the gut environment, that showed a significant and parallel response (shared between both host species) to the hydrochemical gradients in this study (Fig. "
"40","environment","We observed a significant response of bacterial communities from both host species to the hydrochemical gradients, comprising 10 environmental physicochemical parameters. "
"41","environment","Our results concur, as they show a significant effect of environmental factors on the bacterial community structure of two different fish host species, which showed a similar response independently (Fig. 1 and Fig. "
"42","environment","The impact of the isolated and stable nature of the gut environment, combined with the impact of fish diets (piscivorous diet for black piranhas and detritivorous diet for flag cichlids) and immune response, may surpass the influence of environmental hydrochemical parameters as drivers of gut bacterial community structure. "
"43","environment","This tissue-specific difference in connectivity between bacterial taxa might be related to the high stability of the buffered fish gut environment (Payne 1978). "
"44","environment","The skin mucus bacterial taxa are more exposed to environmental disturbances than gut bacterial taxa, due to their direct contact with the surrounding environment. "

"47","environment","The effect of selection by environmental conditions – an important deterministic factor influencing bacterial community development – can be modeled and predicted (Martiny et al. "
"48","environment","Thus, the environmentspecific core taxa (Fig. 4) – as opposed to all other non-core taxa – are potentially positively selected according to the water color factor. "
"49","environment","Positive selection for a certain trait in a given environment can shed light on the adaptation mechanisms of species exploiting this environment. "
"50","environment","In parallel, in a bacterial-communitywide approach, we can infer that taxa under selection should exhibit significantly greater differences in relative abundance among populations living in different environments than expected under neutrality. "
"51","environment","Two of these four groups (Reyranella massiliensis and Roseiarcus fermentans) were especially interesting, as they were undetectable in environmental water, and therefore exhibited a very strong niche preference for fish-associated habitats. "
"52","environment","Thus, we believe these two taxa represent key bacterial markers that could be investigated further, using a functional approach, to explore the potentially adaptive role of bacterial taxa in facilitating environmental adaptation to water colors in Amazonia. "
"53","environment","For example, bacterial taxa in pea aphids provide selectable allelic variation (e.g., color, thermotolerance) that enables the host to thrive in a vast range of different environmental conditions (Oliver et al., 2009; Tsuchida et al., 2010; Moran and Yun, 2015). "
"54","environment","One of the interspecific bacterial markers identified in our study (Reyranella massiliensis) is especially interesting as it is known to interact with aromatic carbon compounds (Pagnier et al. 2012), such as the humic and fulvic acids which are abundant in black water environments (Sioli 1984), and which are known to play key roles in the osmotic equilibrium of fishes in acidic and ion-poor black water habitats (Duarte et al. "
"55","environment","We partitioned the effects of water color into several physicochemical parameters, which impacted differently gut and skin mucus bacterial communities, probably due to the nested and stable nature of the gut environment, contrasting with the exposed and variable nature of the skin mucus habitat.
