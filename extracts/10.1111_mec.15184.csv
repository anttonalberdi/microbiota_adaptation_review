"1","wild","Using a 16S metabarcoding approach, we investigated the microbiota of 43 wild M. festivus, 32 S. rhombeus, and seven water samples, collected at seven sampling sites encompassing both water colors. "
"2","wild","While the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of several wild Amazonian fish species have been documented (Cooke et al. 2012a,b,c,d, 2014), their resident bacterial genomes have never been investigated and the extent to which fish bacterial communities change along the hydrochemical gradients in Amazonia is still unknown. "
"3","wild","We used a metabarcoding approach targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S gene to analyze the gut and skin mucus bacterial communities of 43 wild flag cichlids, 32 black piranhas, and seven water samples, collected at seven sampling sites encompassing both water colors. "
"4","wild","However, the response of fish bacterial communities to a gradient of physicochemical environments in the wild have never been studied (but see Llewellyn et al. "
"5","wild","It is paramount to study wild fish bacterial consortia, as they evolve in complex environments shaped by water physicochemical parameters, trophic networks and biotic/abiotic disturbances, which are documented to drive microbiota compositional shifts (reviewed in Ghanbari et al. 2015) in controlled conditions. "
"6","wild","Furthermore, wild Amazonian fishes are extensively exploited by local fishing communities, which have an annual per capita fish consumption rate exceeding 30 kg among the highest in the world (FAO, 2011). "
"7","wild","Thus, it is important to understand the forces driving the structure of wild Amazonian fish microbiotas, as these microbial consortia potentially play crucial roles in the survival, the growth, the local adaptation and the geographical repartition of native fishes the primary protein source in the region. "
"8","wild","All rights reserved. (2015) did not detect any parallel evolution in the microbiota of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), neither in the wild nor following dietary manipulation. "
"9","wild","Conclusion This study showed that wild Amazonian fish bacterial communities are significantly restructured by the hydrochemical gradients encompassing the black and white waters of Amazonia. "
"10","adaptation","Fish bacterial communities contain an important genetic heritage essential for their hosts' survival, and are also involved in adaptive divergence via niche adaptation processes, but the extent to which they evolve in response to hydrochemical gradients in Amazonia is unknown. "
"11","adaptation","All rights reserved. reciprocal transplant experiments will provide further insights on the potential contribution of Amazonian fish microbiomes in host adaptation and ecological speciation events. "
"12","adaptation","All rights reserved. may play prominent roles in their hosts’ adaptive divergence to water color via niche adaptation processes; fish microbiotas play key roles to support physiological functions essential to the hosts’ survival and metabolism (nutriment assimilation, immune system modulation, ion absorption, amino acid synthesis, detoxification and more) in accordance with the specific selection pressures in their environment (reviewed in Ghanbari et al. "
"13","adaptation","Thus, there is a potentially extensive functional genes pool, fundamental to the survival and adaptation of host-microbiota metaorganisms (also termed ""holobionts""), that is comprised in the genomes of host-associated bacteria (Margulis and Fester 1991). "
"14","adaptation","Thus, it is important to understand the forces driving the structure of wild Amazonian fish microbiotas, as these microbial consortia potentially play crucial roles in the survival, the growth, the local adaptation and the geographical repartition of native fishes the primary protein source in the region. "
"15","adaptation","Parallelisms and community adaptation Biological communities overcome short-term or stochastic pressures by acclimation (i.e. physiological adaptation), whereas continuous or predictable pressures can be met by community adaptation (i.e. genetically determined response) (Bradshaw and Hardwick 1989; Davison and Pearson 1996; DeAngelis et al. "
"16","adaptation","Positive selection for a certain trait in a given environment can shed light on the adaptation mechanisms of species exploiting this environment. "
"17","adaptation","Thus, we believe these two taxa represent key bacterial markers that could be investigated further, using a functional approach, to explore the potentially adaptive role of bacterial taxa in facilitating environmental adaptation to water colors in Amazonia. "
"18","adaptation","Our results are correlative and, thus, we cannot infer causative roles of bacterial taxa in fish adaptation to water color. "
"19","adaptation","Shedding light on microbe-mediated adaptation to water color may indicate a physiological adaptation of Amazonian fish-microbe holobionts to the high heterogeneity of hydrochemical parameters found in their vast distribution area. "
"20","adaptation","Reciprocal transplant experiments (e.g. using a F1 generation of fish with 'seeded' microbiotas exposed to different water colors in the laboratory) would enable hypothesis tests on whether the recruitment of these bacterial markers results from neutral source-sink processes or local adaptation (Kawecki and Ebert 2004). "

"22","adaptation","Conceptual issues in local adaptation. "
"23","model","The physiological tolerance and geographical distribution of black piranhas and flag cichlids at various sites in both water colors make them great models to explore intra and interspecific structural parallelisms in the response of their bacterial communities to the widespread hydrochemical gradients in Amazonia. "
"24","model","Ionic compositions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) of waters (N = 3) were analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer model 3100). "
"25","model","The effect of selection by environmental conditions – an important deterministic factor influencing bacterial community development – can be modeled and predicted (Martiny et al. "
