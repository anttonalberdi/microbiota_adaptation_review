"1","wild","We also confirmed the presence of spontaneous intestinal dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in ERAP1−/− mice, however the transfer of healthy microbiota from wild type mice via cross-fostering experiments did not resolve the skeletal phenotypes of ERAP1−/− mice.

"3","model","Together, our data suggests that ERAP1−/− mice may serve as a useful animal model for studying pathogenesis of intestinal, skeletal, and immunological manifestations of Ankylosing Spondylitis. "
"4","model","Here we show that deficiency of ERAP1 was sufficient to cause a spontaneous and rapid onset of spinal ankylosis, calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL), sacro-iliac (SI) erosions, and systemic osteoporosis in mice, making this a valuable model to use for studying the pathogenesis of these skeletal abnormalities that are also found in human AS. "
"5","model","This is the first report, to our knowledge, identifying a robust animal model in which young animals simultaneously present with spontaneous axial ankylosis and reduced bone density. "
"6","model","These results suggest that the changes observed in DSS-challenged ERAP1−/− mice were not due to anatomic differences prior to the challenge, but rather due to abnormal immune responses to colonic irritation, findings consistent with other models of IBD20,21. "
"7","model","Together, these findings suggest that ERAP1−/− mice are an important and useful new animal model for studying the pathogenesis of the most important skeletal2–4,39 and intestinal manifestations found in AS patients12,14. "
"8","model","In addition, ERAP1−/− mice are a unique animal model which can be used as tool for studying interactions of the gut-bone-immune axis. "
"9","model","ERAP1−/− mice are a suitable model for investigating interactions between gut dysbiosis, skeletal and immune systems. "
"10","model","In summary, we showed that ERAP1−/− mice closely mimic intestinal4,14, immune39,42 and skeletal4 features of AS and may serve as a useful model for studying pathogenesis of AS. "
"11","model","A guide to histomorphological evaluation of intestinal inflammation in mouse models. "
"12","knockout","All experiments were performed on C57BL/6 (WT) or C57BL/6 global ERAP1 knockout mice (ERAP1−/−), which were a kind gift from Dr. "
