"1","wild","We also confirmed the presence of spontaneous intestinal dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in ERAP1−/− mice, however the transfer of healthy microbiota from wild type mice via cross-fostering experiments did not resolve the skeletal phenotypes of ERAP1−/− mice.

"3","model","Together, our data suggests that ERAP1−/− mice may serve as a useful animal model for studying pathogenesis of intestinal, skeletal, and immunological manifestations of Ankylosing Spondylitis. "
"4","model","Here we show that deficiency of ERAP1 was sufficient to cause a spontaneous and rapid onset of spinal ankylosis, calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL), sacro-iliac (SI) erosions, and systemic osteoporosis in mice, making this a valuable model to use for studying the pathogenesis of these skeletal abnormalities that are also found in human AS. "
"5","model","This is the first report, to our knowledge, identifying a robust animal model in which young animals simultaneously present with spontaneous axial ankylosis and reduced bone density. "
"6","model","These results suggest that the changes observed in DSS-challenged ERAP1−/− mice were not due to anatomic differences prior to the challenge, but rather due to abnormal immune responses to colonic irritation, findings consistent with other models of IBD20,21. "
"7","model","Together, these findings suggest that ERAP1−/− mice are an important and useful new animal model for studying the pathogenesis of the most important skeletal2–4,39 and intestinal manifestations found in AS patients12,14. "
"8","model","In addition, ERAP1−/− mice are a unique animal model which can be used as tool for studying interactions of the gut-bone-immune axis. "
"9","model","ERAP1−/− mice are a suitable model for investigating interactions between gut dysbiosis, skeletal and immune systems. "
"10","model","In summary, we showed that ERAP1−/− mice closely mimic intestinal4,14, immune39,42 and skeletal4 features of AS and may serve as a useful model for studying pathogenesis of AS. "

"
"16","disease","The AS index was also used to evaluate disease progression between ERAP1−/− and WT mice over time [Fig. 1f]. "
"17","disease","In addition to skeletal involvement, AS patients are known to have an increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with 5–10% of AS patients developing IBD4, and up to 60% of AS patients having evidence of subclinical gut inflammation in the terminal ileum4,12. "
"18","disease","Mice were also monitored for weight loss, stool consistency, and rectal bleeding scores, all of which were used to calculate an overall colitis disease activity index (DAI). "
"19","disease","While there is strong evidence suggesting that the intestinal microbiota plays a role in modulating immune diseases that affect the intestine, such as IBD23, there is less information available in regard to the direct role of the gut microbiota in causing arthritic autoimmune diseases, such as AS15,24. "
"20","disease","Although less-studied than conventional Tregs, Tr1 cell functions have been implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)27, Multiple Sclerosis (MS)28, and IBD29, all of which have associations with ERAP1 polymorphisms30. "
"21","disease","TNFα is thought to play a major role in disc degeneration via recruitment of inflammatory cells to the IVD, destruction of extracellular matrix, and calcification and hyperalgesia associated with IVD disease43. "
"22","disease","Commensal bacteria have been shown to play an important role in shaping the immune system, maintaining skeletal and gut homeostasis, and are thought to contribute to inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), IBD, and MS15–17,44. "
"23","disease","Given these associations, further studies investigating the role of ERAP1 in Tr1 cell differentiation and function may prove to be useful in understanding if ERAP1-mediated Tr1 reduction plays a role in pathogenesis of AS or any other ERAP1-associated diseases30. "

"29","human","Our detailed skeletal survey of ERAP1−/− mice showed that ERAP1−/− mice not only exclusively developed spinal ankylosis between L6 and S1 [Fig. 1b,c], but also developed other hallmarks of human AS, such as iliac erosions [Supplemental Fig. 1a,b] and calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament [Supplemental Fig. 1c].
