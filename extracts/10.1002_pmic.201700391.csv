"1","wild","MS proteomic analysis of colonic samples permitted the identification of 10 000–12 000 unique peptides that corresponded to 5610 protein clusters identified across three groups, including the colitic Rag1−/− T cell recipients, isogenic Rag1−/− controls, and wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","Mice Animal protocols were approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Scripps Research Institute; The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol #:160023. 6-week old B6.129S7-Rag1tm1mom/J (Rag1−/−) mice (Rag) and wild-type C57BL/6J (WT) mice were cohoused for two weeks to normalize the microbiota (see Supporting Information, S1 for details).

"4","model","Here, the authors utilize the well-characterized murine T cell transfer model of colitis to find specific changes within the intestinal luminal proteome associated with inflammation. "
"5","model","In combination with 16S sequencing, the authors’ metaproteomics-based microbiome studies provide a foundation for assessing alterations in intestinal luminal protein functionalities in a robust and well-characterized mouse model of colitis, and set the stage for future studies to further explore the functional mechanisms of altered protein functionalities associated with dysbiosis and inflammation. "
"6","model","1–6] Numerous mouse models of colitis suggest an important role for the intestinal bacteria in disease propagation. "
"7","model","In this study,we expandedupon the currentmetaproteomics techniques anduse the robust andhighly reproducible murineT cell transfermodel of colitis aswell as a comprehensive databaseofmouse, human, plant, and allmicrobial genomes sequenced todate to elucidate alterations in both host andgutmicrobial proteins associatedwith intestinal inflammation.Our results show that host genetics, gutmicrobiota, and inflammationhave tremendous influences on the intestinal luminal proteomic landscape. gut microbiota, and inflammation importantly contribute to the alterations observed in the intestinal luminal proteome. "
"8","model","26] The method is briefly described as follows: spectral count data is modeled using the negative binomial distribution, which allows determination of the mean–variance relationship. "
"9","model","Mouse Model of Colitis We used the well-established murine T cell transfer model of colitis for our studies.["
"10","model","Global proteomic survey of intestinal contents from a murine colitis model. "
"11","model","Furthermore, we observed an altered ratio of these phyla in the RT mice, with an increase in Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, which has been described in other mouse models of colitis as well as in IBD patients.["
"12","model","Future studies utilizing a cotransfer of B cells in this T cell transfer colitis model can help distinguish the contributions of intestinal inflammation versus genetic background in the expansion of bacterial flagellins in these mice. "
"13","model","This phylum is known to expand in other intestinal inflammation models.["
