"1","wild","MS proteomic analysis of colonic samples permitted the identification of 10 000–12 000 unique peptides that corresponded to 5610 protein clusters identified across three groups, including the colitic Rag1−/− T cell recipients, isogenic Rag1−/− controls, and wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","Mice Animal protocols were approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Scripps Research Institute; The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol #:160023. 6-week old B6.129S7-Rag1tm1mom/J (Rag1−/−) mice (Rag) and wild-type C57BL/6J (WT) mice were cohoused for two weeks to normalize the microbiota (see Supporting Information, S1 for details).
