"1","wild","We found that oceanic and freshwater fish in the wild and in the laboratory share many intestinal microbial community members. "
"2","wild","RESULTS Wild-caught and laboratory-reared stickleback share a core gut microbiota To establish whether it would be feasible to compare immune responses to microbiota across stickleback populations, we first characterized the gut microbes from wild-caught and laboratoryreared stickleback from both oceanic and freshwater populations using culture-based assays. "
"3","wild","The adult populations examined include wild stickleback caught from a coastal oceanic Oregon population, a freshwater river Oregon population, a laboratory-raised population derived from an oceanic Alaskan population (Rabbit Slough), and a laboratory-raised freshwater Alaskan population (Boot Lake) (Table S1). "
"4","wild","The original wild Alaskan populations evolved separately in two different environments [oceanic in a high-saltwater open ocean with yearly migration to a low-salinity slough, and freshwater in an isolated freshwater lake (Cresko et al., 2004)], but were maintained in the laboratory in identical diet and intermediate salinity conditions. "
"5","wild","Because the laboratory populations are raised in a controlled environment with presumably very different microbial exposures, we entertained the possibility that the laboratory-raised population would have different microbiota from the wild populations. "
"6","wild","However, we found that, although the wildcaught fish had several additional microbial colony types compared to the laboratory-reared populations, stickleback populations raised in the laboratory shared many of the bacteria genera with the wild populations. "
"7","wild","The finding of common microbes in all populations is striking given that thewild-caught fish were maintained in their native water, which varies in salinity and other chemical and biological components from each other and from the laboratory water. "
"8","wild","Stickleback from wild-caught oceanic populations had three microbial colony types that were not found in any other populations; all were identified to be Vibrio or the closely related Listonella. "
"9","wild","Freshwater wild stickleback were the only fish with four unique colony types, identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Oerskovia, Serratia, Aeromonas and one unidentifiable; none were highly abundant or found in all freshwater wild fish. "
"10","wild","Owing to the similarity between the microbiota of the wild and laboratory-raised populations, we concluded that the laboratory-raised stickleback populations were suitable for studying naturally occurring host-microbe interactions. "
"11","wild","Bacterial isolates collected from lab-raised and wild-caught stickleback. "
"12","wild","Bacteria were isolated from the guts of lab-raised Alaskan adult stickleback and wild-caught Oregon freshwater and oceanic populations. "
"13","wild","In addition, the laboratoryreared fish harbored very similar bacterial taxa to those that we cultured from wild-caught oceanic and freshwater stickleback. "
"14","wild","Our culture-based survey of microbiota in wild-caught and laboratory-reared fish was too limited to draw conclusions about microbiota diversity; however, a recent survey of intestinal microbiota from estuary, stream and lake stickleback observed highest alpha diversity in lakederived populations (Smith et al., 2015), consistent with our expectation. "
"15","wild","Wild Oregon freshwater fish were collected from the River Bend site on the McKenzie river (44°4.666′N, 123°1.6′W); adult wild Oregon oceanic fish Fig. "
"16","wild","Natural genetic variation in the lab-raised populations is maintained by periodically fertilizing lab-raised eggs with macerated testes from wild fish caught in the same location. "
"17","wild","Bacterial isolation Ten adult sexually mature fish from each wild population and 15 adult sexually mature fish – between 1.5 and 2 years post-fertilization – from each lab-raised population were euthanized with MS222. "
