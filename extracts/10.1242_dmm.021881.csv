"1","wild","We found that oceanic and freshwater fish in the wild and in the laboratory share many intestinal microbial community members. "
"2","wild","RESULTS Wild-caught and laboratory-reared stickleback share a core gut microbiota To establish whether it would be feasible to compare immune responses to microbiota across stickleback populations, we first characterized the gut microbes from wild-caught and laboratoryreared stickleback from both oceanic and freshwater populations using culture-based assays. "
"3","wild","The adult populations examined include wild stickleback caught from a coastal oceanic Oregon population, a freshwater river Oregon population, a laboratory-raised population derived from an oceanic Alaskan population (Rabbit Slough), and a laboratory-raised freshwater Alaskan population (Boot Lake) (Table S1). "
"4","wild","The original wild Alaskan populations evolved separately in two different environments [oceanic in a high-saltwater open ocean with yearly migration to a low-salinity slough, and freshwater in an isolated freshwater lake (Cresko et al., 2004)], but were maintained in the laboratory in identical diet and intermediate salinity conditions. "
"5","wild","Because the laboratory populations are raised in a controlled environment with presumably very different microbial exposures, we entertained the possibility that the laboratory-raised population would have different microbiota from the wild populations. "
"6","wild","However, we found that, although the wildcaught fish had several additional microbial colony types compared to the laboratory-reared populations, stickleback populations raised in the laboratory shared many of the bacteria genera with the wild populations. "
"7","wild","The finding of common microbes in all populations is striking given that thewild-caught fish were maintained in their native water, which varies in salinity and other chemical and biological components from each other and from the laboratory water. "
"8","wild","Stickleback from wild-caught oceanic populations had three microbial colony types that were not found in any other populations; all were identified to be Vibrio or the closely related Listonella. "
"9","wild","Freshwater wild stickleback were the only fish with four unique colony types, identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Oerskovia, Serratia, Aeromonas and one unidentifiable; none were highly abundant or found in all freshwater wild fish. "
"10","wild","Owing to the similarity between the microbiota of the wild and laboratory-raised populations, we concluded that the laboratory-raised stickleback populations were suitable for studying naturally occurring host-microbe interactions. "
"11","wild","Bacterial isolates collected from lab-raised and wild-caught stickleback. "
"12","wild","Bacteria were isolated from the guts of lab-raised Alaskan adult stickleback and wild-caught Oregon freshwater and oceanic populations. "
"13","wild","In addition, the laboratoryreared fish harbored very similar bacterial taxa to those that we cultured from wild-caught oceanic and freshwater stickleback. "
"14","wild","Our culture-based survey of microbiota in wild-caught and laboratory-reared fish was too limited to draw conclusions about microbiota diversity; however, a recent survey of intestinal microbiota from estuary, stream and lake stickleback observed highest alpha diversity in lakederived populations (Smith et al., 2015), consistent with our expectation. "
"15","wild","Wild Oregon freshwater fish were collected from the River Bend site on the McKenzie river (44°4.666′N, 123°1.6′W); adult wild Oregon oceanic fish Fig. "
"16","wild","Natural genetic variation in the lab-raised populations is maintained by periodically fertilizing lab-raised eggs with macerated testes from wild fish caught in the same location. "
"17","wild","Bacterial isolation Ten adult sexually mature fish from each wild population and 15 adult sexually mature fish – between 1.5 and 2 years post-fertilization – from each lab-raised population were euthanized with MS222. "

"21","mutant","We developed the threespine stickleback fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus, as an evolutionary mutant animal model (Albertson et al., 2009) to study the inflammatory response to resident intestinal microbiota in a host with natural genetic variation. "
"22","mutant","Evolutionary mutant models for human disease. "
"23","inbred","The current inbred animal models used for IBD research have little of such complex genetic variation and therefore have limited value for identifying diagnostic or predictive genetic markers of complex diseases (DeVoss and Diehl, 2014). "
"24","model","The immune dysregulation of IBD has complex genetic underpinnings that cannot be fully recapitulated with single-gene-knockout models. "
"25","model","A deeper understanding of the genetic regulation of innate immune responses to resident microbes requires the ability to measure immune responses in the presence and absence of the microbiota using vertebrate models with complex genetic variation. "
"26","model","Here, we describe a new gnotobiotic vertebrate model to explore the natural genetic variation that contributes to differences in innate immune responses to microbiota. "
"27","model","The gnotobiotic stickleback model that we have developed therefore provides a platform for future studies mapping the natural genetic basis of the variation in immune response to microbes. "
"28","model","KEY WORDS: Neutrophils, Gnotobiotic, Stickleback, Animal model, Germ-free, Fish INTRODUCTION Animals and their associated microbial communities co-exist in dynamic relationships involving complex networks of interactions and signals (McFall-Ngai et al., 2013). "
"29","model","Vertebrate models are therefore valuable for understanding pathologies of microbiota–immune-system relationships. "
"30","model","To understand the role of microbiota in inflammatory diseases, animal models can be compared in the presence or absence of microbes. "
"31","model","Genetic manipulations and chemical treatments have been used to model IBD in mice and zebrafish (Hansen and Sartor, 2015; Oehlers et al., 2013; Sartor, 2009; Xavier and Podolsky, 2007). "
"32","model","In almost all cases, these animal models have shown reduced gut inflammation when raised in germ-free conditions, indicating that the increases in neutrophils and other immune cells are due to responses to the microbiota. "

"35","model","We developed the threespine stickleback fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus, as an evolutionary mutant animal model (Albertson et al., 2009) to study the inflammatory response to resident intestinal microbiota in a host with natural genetic variation. "
"36","model","Stickleback have long been used as a model organism to study the evolution of complex traits such as behavior and ecological morphologies (Bell and Foster, 1994), and have recently become a pre-eminent model for identifying the polygenic basis of natural phenotypic variation (Colosimo et al., 2004, 2005; Cresko et al., 2004; Glazer et al., 2015; Greenwood et al., 2013; Kimmel et al., 2012; Leinonen et al., 2012). "
"37","model","We adapted the threespine stickleback model to examine the innate immune response to intestinal microbiota in two closely related populations of stickleback, an oceanic population similar to the ancestral population and a derived freshwater population; these two populations have likely been exposed to different microbial communities for at least 10,000 years (Hohenlohe et al., 2010a). "
"38","model","Use of this gnotobiotic stickleback model will allow us to dissect the genetic and microbial factors that modulate host intestinal inflammatory responses and will provide new approaches to studying the genetic variation underlying human diseases of microbiota–immune-system dysregulation. "
"39","model","Developing stickleback as a gnotobiotic model system In order to examine the impact of the microbiota on stickleback development, we established methods to rear stickleback larvae in the absence of microbes. "
"40","model","This host population-by-microbiota interaction was driven by the MA treatment because testing the model with only GF and CV treatments did not yield a significant Fig. "
"41","model","Other peroxidase paralogs in the stickleback genome could, in principle, contribute to the observed histological data, but thempx gene expression data are consistent with counts of intestinal neutrophils in the different populations and highlight the power of the RNA-seq method for future discovery of transcriptional inflammatory responses in this model. "
"42","model","Freshwater populations show variation in the neutrophil response We chose stickleback as a model system because of the natural genetic variation that exists among populations and also among individuals within a population.Wewanted to determinewhether the phenotype of the immune response to microbiota varied across families within the same population. "
"43","model","Therefore, we developed gnotobiotic stickleback as an experimental model system to explore natural variation in host immune responses to gutmicrobiota,with the long-term goal of identifying genes and pathways that might contribute to human polygenic diseases of excessive inflammatory responses to resident microbes, such as IBD (Xavier and Podolsky, 2007). "
"44","model","Ten million 100-nucleotide (100nt) Illumina HiSeq2500 reads from each sample were aligned to the Ensembl v75 threespine stickleback reference genome; we counted the number of reads mapped uniquely to each gene model, and we performed normalization and differential expression analysis using the negative binomial generalized linear models implemented in the R statistical package edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010).
