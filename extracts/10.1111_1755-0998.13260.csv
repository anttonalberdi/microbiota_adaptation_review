"2","wild","All rights reserved Abstract The ability to generate genomic data from wild animal populations has the potential to give unprecedented insight into the population history and dynamics of species in their natural habitats. "
"3","wild","In this study we evaluate the success of multiple sources of genetic material (feces, urine, dentin, and dental calculus) and several capture methods (shotgun, whole-genome, exome) in generating genome-scale data in wild eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) from Gombe National Park, Tanzania. "
"4","wild","These results highlight urine as a promising and untapped source of DNA that can be noninvasively collected from wild populations of many species. "
"5","wild","All rights reserved Introduction The development of methods to generate genetic data from noninvasively collected samples revolutionized the study of wild animal populations, allowing for DNA research without the capture or even observation of species of interest (Kohn & Wayne, 1997; Waits & Paetkau, 2005). "
"6","wild","All rights reserved In addition to methodological development, turning to other sources of biological material might improve sequencing success in wild populations. "
"7","wild","Combining data from historic populations with those from contemporary populations has the potential to provide genomic insight into wild populations on a scale not yet fully realized. "
"8","wild","In this study, we evaluate the success of several sources of host DNA and capture methods in generating genome-scale data in a population of wild, endangered animals. "
"9","wild","Specifically, we extracted and captured endogenous DNA from feces, dental calculus, dentin, and urine recovered from wild chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) from Gombe National Park, Tanzania. "
"10","wild","All rights reserved Materials and Methods Sample Collection and Extraction We collected fecal samples in RNAlater from four wild chimpanzees as described (Stone et al., 2010) (7069, 7150, 7365, and 7507) from Gombe National Park between August 2011 and January 2014 and shipped them to the University of Pennsylvania for storage at -80°C. "
"11","wild","We collected urine from seven wild Gombe chimpanzees—three with matched fecal samples (7150, 7365, and 7507) and four others (7072, 7323, 7535, and 7650)—in the early morning using fresh plastic bags attached to sticks suspended below chimpanzee nests. "
"12","wild","Discussion The development of noninvasive genomic methods is critically important for studying wild populations, particularly those that cannot otherwise be legally or ethically sampled. "
"13","wild","In this study, we evaluated four biological sources of DNA that can be sampled from wild populations of many taxa: feces, urine, dentin, and dental calculus. "
"14","wild","Feces and urine may be noninvasively sampled from contemporary living populations, while dentin and dental calculus can often be sampled from skeletal collections of wild populations present in collections at museums and field sites. "
"15","wild","Previous studies have demonstrated both that host DNA is present in urine and can be successfully extracted and amplified (Hausknecht et al., 2007; Hayakawa & Takenaka, 1999; Hedmark et al., 2004; Nota & Takenaka, 1999; Valiere & Taberlet, 2000; Waits & Paetkau, 2005); however, our results show for the first time that urine in fact has an high fraction of host DNA compared to other sources of DNA, like feces, that are far more commonly used in genetic studies of wild animals, and thus is well-suited for genomic analysis. "
"16","wild","We therefore suggest that more work is needed to explore and optimize DNA capture from calculus in wild populations. "
"17","wild","Thus, noninvasive genomic methods are critical for monitoring the health of wild populations as well as aspects of local adaptation and population history important for conservation management. "
"18","wild","The results of our study highlight urine as a promising and untapped source of DNA for this and other genomic work in not only chimpanzees, but wild populations of A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. "
"19","wild","The expanding methodological toolset for noninvasive genetics, combined with a rapidly increasing number of reference genomes across vertebrates (e.g Rhie et al., 2020), holds great promise to usher in a bright future exploring the genomics of virtually any wild population. "

"25","model","While studies of individual DNA markers improved our understanding of behavior, ecology, and evolution, recent advances in massively parallel sequencing strategies make it possible to incorporate information from across the entire genome, giving unprecedented insight into the evolution and population history of non-model species (Ellegren, 2014).

"27","environment","Rich in gut epithelial cells and often the most abundant, easiest to collect source of DNA in the environment, feces have long played a role in noninvasive genetic analyses (Constable, Ashley, Goodall, & Pusey, 2001; Hoss, Kohn, Paabo, Knauer, & Schroder, 1992; Kohn & Wayne, 1997). "
"28","environment","Urine, in particular, is abundant for many large-bodied species, and has been used, albeit infrequently, as a source of DNA collected noninvasively from the environment (Hedmark et al., 2004; Sastre et al., 2009; Valiere & Taberlet, 2000). "

"35","human","Human exome baits have been successfully used in a number of nonhuman primate studies (George et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2012; Vallender, 2011) and have been shown to work in primate species as distantly related from humans as Strepsirrhines (Webster, Guevara, Lawler, & Bradley, 2018).
