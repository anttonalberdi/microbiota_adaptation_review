"2","wild","Faecal samples were collected from deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) born and raised in captivity and the wild at approximately 3–5 weeks of age. "

"6","wild","Germ-free and laboratory-based studies have limited application to animals in the wild [43, 45]; therefore, we investigated how captive and wild environments influence α-diversity and composition of deer mouse GMCs as well as the consequences of deer mice being translocated between the two environments.

"18","wild","We co-housed deer mice that were born in captivity at two individuals per cage, while deer mice translocated into captivity from the wild were provided with their own cage to avoid potential agonistic interactions between unrelated individuals. "
"19","wild","Statistical differences between group GMCs and litters (for captive-born deer mice) were tested together using adonis (PERMANOVA) models, with 9999 permutations and reported F, R2 and p values, to determine if there were significant differences between captive and wild GMCs. "
"20","wild","The same approach was used to test for sex differences; however, a separate analysis was conducted for captive and wild individuals. "

"24","wild","In total, 69 individuals were included in the initial capture phase (n= 36 captive born; n= 33 wild born). "
"25","wild","Faecal samples from 34 deer mice were obtained during the post-translocation sampling period of the experiment: 8 captive–captive, 5 captive–wild, 13 wild–captive and 8 wild–wild. "
"26","wild","The GMC composition of male and female deer mice held in captive (Weighted UniFrac: F= 1.81, R2= 0.051, p= 0.10) and wild (Weighted UniFrac: F= 1.77, R2= 0.054, p= 0.10) environments were only marginally different and explained only 5.1% and 5.4% of the variation, respectively. "

"55","wild","Discussion We assessed GMC α-diversity and composition of captive and wild deer mice as well as changes that occurred within GMCs following reciprocal translocation events between captive and wild environments. "
"56","wild","The gut microbiome of both captive and wild deer mice were dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria; however, clear differences in α-diversity and community composition were present between wild and captive populations. "
"57","wild","Compared to captive animals, wild conspecifics are exposed to more diverse microbial meta-communities via environmental sources (e.g. larger ranges, seasonality, social interactions, expansive diets) that can serve to increase the diversity of GMCs [11–15, 45, 60– 62]. "

"
"66","wild","Firmicutes have been associated with digestion efficiency [67] and may be crucial for wild animals that need to maximize energy extraction from their diet due to threats that are not present in captive environments (e.g. food scarcity, predation). "
"67","wild","Differences between the GMCs of wild and captive deer mice were driven by changes in the relative abundance of particular microbial families. "
"68","wild","Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Helicobacteraceae were indicative of GMCs in wild deer mice, while S24-7 was associated with microbial communities in captive mice. "
"69","wild","Helicobacteraceae (ε-Proteobacteria) contains microbes that are opportunistic pathogens [72]; however, this family appears to be consistently present in the gut microbiome of wild murine populations [15, 66, 73]. "
"70","wild","The gut microbiome of deer mice translocated to the wild increased levels of α-diversity and developed communities that were similar to native wild mice. "
"71","wild","Upon being translocated to the wild the GMCs of C–W mice increased in diversity, presumably because they were exposed to diverse microbial meta-communities that were likely absent from captive environments. "
"72","wild","It is important to note that animals brought into captivity rapidly lost GMC diversity, suggesting that gut microbiome studies on wild populations should not be conducted in captive settings. "
"73","wild","Deer mice in the wild retained fewer microbial species (i.e. "
"74","wild","The microbial family S24-7 was the most dominant in deer mice that were in captivity during the 2-week translocation phase of the experiment (captive–captive and wild–captive groups). "

"
"76","wild","Ruminococcaceae was more abundant in wild deer mice compared to mice in captivity, while Helicobacteriaceae maintained the lowest abundance in deer mice that were never exposed to the wild. "
"77","wild","These results suggest that Ruminococcaceae and Helicobacteraceae are more prominent in wild environments and rely on continued exposure to the natural environment to maintain high relative abundances within GMCs. "
"78","wild","C–W mice regained some natural GMC diversity upon being translocated to the wild, however, failed to achieve the same level of αdiversity as W–W mice. "
"79","wild","Similarly, free range (i.e. outdoor enclosures) Tasmanian devils were shown to contain intermediate gut microbiome α-diversity levels compared to captive and wild populations [22], suggesting that limited ranges may inhibit the ability for individuals to achieve the α-diversity levels as high as wild conspecifics. "
"80","wild","The relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Helicobacteraceae was dependent on exposure to the wild. "
"81","wild","Translocated groups demonstrated significant reciprocal changes in the relative abundance of these families (including OTUs further identified as Oscillospira and Helicobacter rodentium [72]) that were characteristic of wild deer mice GMCs. "
"82","wild","The associated between Oscillospira and the wild environment may be a result of wild mice continually experiencing periods of fasting, leaness and glycan degradation [79]. "
"83","wild","The impact of Ruminococcaceae (particularly Oscillospira) and Helicobacteraceae on host fitness should be further studied since these families are prominent in GMC of wild deer mice, yet only maintain lower relative abundances in captivity. "

"
"87","wild","OTUs belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae also increased in relative abundance in deer mice translocated to the wild while showing the opposite in reciprocally transplanted mice. "
"88","wild","In a similar scenario two different Lactobillaceae species were identified as being characteristic in the GMC of captive and wild mice (wild— Lactobicillus murinus; captivity—L. intestinalis). "
"89","wild","It is important to note that this study did not examine the GMC functional diversity between captive and wild deer mice, however, does provide speculative evidence that functional diversity can be preserved in captivity. "
"90","wild","Maternal and sex influences Maternal influences were present during the initial sampling of captive-born deer mice; however, post-translocation C– W deer mice contained GMCs that were more similar to wild deer mice than their siblings that remained in captivity. "
"91","wild","Sex differences explained relatively little variation within GMC of wild and captive mice, likely as a result of individuals being reproductively immature and captive mice co-habituating. "
"92","wild","Ruminoccocaceae and Lachnospiraceae have previously associated with maintaining healthy microbiomes and digestion, suggesting that animals in captivity may be deprived of microbes that have important functional roles in wild environments. "
