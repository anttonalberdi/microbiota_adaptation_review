"1","wild","Finally, microbiome studies revealed modest differences in the gut microbiota between Ccl28-/mice and their cohoused wild-type littermates. "
"2","wild","Unless otherwise specified, controls for most experiments were wildtype (WT) littermates obtained in the process of maintaining the Ccl28-/mouse colony. "
"3","wild","Analysis of the Microbiota Fecal samples were collected from Ccl28-/mice and wildtype, cohoused littermate mice. "
"4","wild","We, therefore, sought to analyze the gut microbiome of Ccl28-/mice and compare them to their cohoused wild-type littermates. "
"5","wild","WT, wild type. "
"6","wild","Representative experiment (out of 2) is shown. qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; VNO, vomeronasal organ; WT, wild type. "
"7","wild","WT, wild type. "
"8","wild","CFU, colony-forming units; WT, wild type. "
"9","wild","Although we did detect some differences in the microbiome of the Ccl28-/mice relative to cohoused wildtype littermates (Fig. 6), they were relatively modest and the only significant changes were among a few taxa that individually represent £1% of the microbiota. "
"10","wild","A recent report also showed only minor changes in the microbiota of another Ccl28-/mouse and cohoused wild-type mice (not littermates) (Matsuo and others 2018). "
"11","wild","WT, wild type. "
"12","model","Importantly, Ccl28-/mice are highly susceptible to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in an acute model of infection, indicating that CCL28 plays a major role in innate immunity against Salmonella in the gut. "
"13","model","Finally, we observed that Ccl28-/mice are highly susceptible to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in an acute infection model, indicating that CCL28 plays a pivotal protective role in enteric infections. "
"14","model","Salmonella infection Mice were infected as previously described using an acute infection model (Barthel and others 2003; Raffatellu and others 2008, 2009). "
"15","model","This acute infection can be modeled in mice by pretreatment with streptomycin 24 h before infection Table 1. "
"16","model","F or p er so na l u se o nl y. (colitis model) (Raffatellu and others 2008, 2009). "
"17","model","We sought to investigate a possible role for CCL28 in resistance against Salmonella using this model. "
"18","model","5, Ccl28-/mice are extremely susceptible to Salmonella in this acute infection model. "
"19","model","We also tested the ability of the Ccl28-/mouse to handle infection with Salmonella in an acute infection model. "
"20","model","In this model, infection develops in a few days and therefore resistance is dependent on innate immunity mechanisms operational in the gut and does not depend on the development of IgA responses (Behnsen and others 2014) because of its short duration (just a few days). "
"21","model","5, Ccl28-/mice are very susceptible to Salmonella in this acute infection model and succumb to the infection rapidly (starting at 24 h). "
"22","model","We favor the second hypothesis, because we have observed that recombinant CCL28 does not show significant antimicrobial activity against the Salmonella strain we used for this model (data not shown), and a knockout mouse of the also mucosal chemokine Cxcl17 does not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to Salmonella in the same acute infection model (data not shown) even though Cxcl17 (like Ccl28) also exhibits broad antimicrobial activity (Burkhardt and others 2012). "
"23","model","We have tested Il-40-/mice in the same Salmonella infection model, and observed that Il-40-/mice did not show increased susceptibility. "
"24","model","Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that CCL28 is part of an important innate immunity mechanism operating in the gut that renders mice resistant to Salmonella in this acute infection model. "
"25","model","Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host. "
"26","model","Olfaction in three genetic and two MPTP-induced Parkinson’s disease mouse models. "
"27","knockout","Briefly, the Ccl28 gene was replaced with a Neo cassette by homologous recombination resulting in a whole-body knockout mouse in the C57Bl/6 background. "
"28","knockout","CCL28 is required for the recruitment of IgA plasmablasts to the mammary gland We obtained a Ccl28-/mouse, which was produced by replacing the Ccl28 mouse gene with a Neo cassette by homologous recombination, resulting in a whole-body Ccl28 knockout mouse. "
"29","knockout","We favor the second hypothesis, because we have observed that recombinant CCL28 does not show significant antimicrobial activity against the Salmonella strain we used for this model (data not shown), and a knockout mouse of the also mucosal chemokine Cxcl17 does not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to Salmonella in the same acute infection model (data not shown) even though Cxcl17 (like Ccl28) also exhibits broad antimicrobial activity (Burkhardt and others 2012).
