"1","wild","Finally, microbiome studies revealed modest differences in the gut microbiota between Ccl28-/mice and their cohoused wild-type littermates. "
"2","wild","Unless otherwise specified, controls for most experiments were wildtype (WT) littermates obtained in the process of maintaining the Ccl28-/mouse colony. "
"3","wild","Analysis of the Microbiota Fecal samples were collected from Ccl28-/mice and wildtype, cohoused littermate mice. "
"4","wild","We, therefore, sought to analyze the gut microbiome of Ccl28-/mice and compare them to their cohoused wild-type littermates. "
"5","wild","WT, wild type. "
"6","wild","Representative experiment (out of 2) is shown. qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; VNO, vomeronasal organ; WT, wild type. "
"7","wild","WT, wild type. "
"8","wild","CFU, colony-forming units; WT, wild type. "
"9","wild","Although we did detect some differences in the microbiome of the Ccl28-/mice relative to cohoused wildtype littermates (Fig. 6), they were relatively modest and the only significant changes were among a few taxa that individually represent Â£1% of the microbiota. "
"10","wild","A recent report also showed only minor changes in the microbiota of another Ccl28-/mouse and cohoused wild-type mice (not littermates) (Matsuo and others 2018). "
"11","wild","WT, wild type. "
