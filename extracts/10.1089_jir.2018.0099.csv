"1","wild","Finally, microbiome studies revealed modest differences in the gut microbiota between Ccl28-/mice and their cohoused wild-type littermates. "
"2","wild","Unless otherwise specified, controls for most experiments were wildtype (WT) littermates obtained in the process of maintaining the Ccl28-/mouse colony. "
"3","wild","Analysis of the Microbiota Fecal samples were collected from Ccl28-/mice and wildtype, cohoused littermate mice. "
"4","wild","We, therefore, sought to analyze the gut microbiome of Ccl28-/mice and compare them to their cohoused wild-type littermates. "
"5","wild","WT, wild type. "
"6","wild","Representative experiment (out of 2) is shown. qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; VNO, vomeronasal organ; WT, wild type. "
"7","wild","WT, wild type. "
"8","wild","CFU, colony-forming units; WT, wild type. "
"9","wild","Although we did detect some differences in the microbiome of the Ccl28-/mice relative to cohoused wildtype littermates (Fig. 6), they were relatively modest and the only significant changes were among a few taxa that individually represent £1% of the microbiota. "
"10","wild","A recent report also showed only minor changes in the microbiota of another Ccl28-/mouse and cohoused wild-type mice (not littermates) (Matsuo and others 2018). "
"11","wild","WT, wild type. "
"12","model","Importantly, Ccl28-/mice are highly susceptible to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in an acute model of infection, indicating that CCL28 plays a major role in innate immunity against Salmonella in the gut. "
"13","model","Finally, we observed that Ccl28-/mice are highly susceptible to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in an acute infection model, indicating that CCL28 plays a pivotal protective role in enteric infections. "
"14","model","Salmonella infection Mice were infected as previously described using an acute infection model (Barthel and others 2003; Raffatellu and others 2008, 2009). "
"15","model","This acute infection can be modeled in mice by pretreatment with streptomycin 24 h before infection Table 1. "
"16","model","F or p er so na l u se o nl y. (colitis model) (Raffatellu and others 2008, 2009). "
"17","model","We sought to investigate a possible role for CCL28 in resistance against Salmonella using this model. "
"18","model","5, Ccl28-/mice are extremely susceptible to Salmonella in this acute infection model. "
"19","model","We also tested the ability of the Ccl28-/mouse to handle infection with Salmonella in an acute infection model. "
"20","model","In this model, infection develops in a few days and therefore resistance is dependent on innate immunity mechanisms operational in the gut and does not depend on the development of IgA responses (Behnsen and others 2014) because of its short duration (just a few days). "
"21","model","5, Ccl28-/mice are very susceptible to Salmonella in this acute infection model and succumb to the infection rapidly (starting at 24 h). "
"22","model","We favor the second hypothesis, because we have observed that recombinant CCL28 does not show significant antimicrobial activity against the Salmonella strain we used for this model (data not shown), and a knockout mouse of the also mucosal chemokine Cxcl17 does not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to Salmonella in the same acute infection model (data not shown) even though Cxcl17 (like Ccl28) also exhibits broad antimicrobial activity (Burkhardt and others 2012). "
"23","model","We have tested Il-40-/mice in the same Salmonella infection model, and observed that Il-40-/mice did not show increased susceptibility. "
"24","model","Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that CCL28 is part of an important innate immunity mechanism operating in the gut that renders mice resistant to Salmonella in this acute infection model. "
"25","model","Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host. "
"26","model","Olfaction in three genetic and two MPTP-induced Parkinson’s disease mouse models. "
"27","knockout","Briefly, the Ccl28 gene was replaced with a Neo cassette by homologous recombination resulting in a whole-body knockout mouse in the C57Bl/6 background. "
"28","knockout","CCL28 is required for the recruitment of IgA plasmablasts to the mammary gland We obtained a Ccl28-/mouse, which was produced by replacing the Ccl28 mouse gene with a Neo cassette by homologous recombination, resulting in a whole-body Ccl28 knockout mouse. "
"29","knockout","We favor the second hypothesis, because we have observed that recombinant CCL28 does not show significant antimicrobial activity against the Salmonella strain we used for this model (data not shown), and a knockout mouse of the also mucosal chemokine Cxcl17 does not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to Salmonella in the same acute infection model (data not shown) even though Cxcl17 (like Ccl28) also exhibits broad antimicrobial activity (Burkhardt and others 2012). "
"30","disease","CCL28 is involved in the host response against enteric infections CCL28 is expressed in the normal small intestine and colon (Table 1) and an increase in CCL28 expression has been associated with epithelial inflammation (Wang and others 2000; Ogawa and others 2004); in line with these findings, CCL28 expression is increased in the colon of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and returns to normal levels when patients are treated with infliximab (anti-TNFa) (Arijs and others 2011). "
"31","disease","In support of this, we have reported lower levels of CCL28 in saliva from patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (Hernandez-Molina and others 2015), suggesting that its absence could account for the greater incidence of Candidiasis in patients with this disease (Yan and others 2011). "
"32","disease","Mucosal gene expression of cell adhesion molecules, chemokines, and chemokine receptors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease before and after infliximab treatment. "
"33","disease","Olfaction in three genetic and two MPTP-induced Parkinson’s disease mouse models. "
"34","human","We have analyzed its production in human tissues using a comprehensive microarray database. "
"35","human","There are 48 human chemokines known, of which 4 represent chemokines with predominant expression in mucosal tissues (Hernandez-Ruiz and Zlotnik 2017). "
"36","human","The following day, cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB and grown at 37C for 3 h, subsequently diluted to *0.5 · 106 CFU/mL in 1 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) as previously described (Hieshima and others 2003), and incubated at 37C in the presence or absence of recombinant human or murine CCL28 (BioLegend). "
"37","human","However, a comprehensive study of its expression in the human body has not been reported. "
"38","human","We analyzed the expression of CCL28 in the BIGE (Body Index of Gene Expression) database that represents 130 tissues from 4 human males and 4 females (Lee and others 2005; Roth and others 2006). "
"39","human","As shown in Fig. 1, the highest expression of CCL28 in the human body is in the salivary glands. "
"40","human","In support of this conclusion, CCL28 is readily detectable in saliva from normal humans (Hieshima and others 2003; HernandezMolina and others 2015). "
"41","human","Hybridization values for the top 14 human tissues that exhibit significant expression of CCL28 are shown in Table 1. "
"42","human","However, this expression pattern suggests that its main role in the human digestive tract may be as an important component of saliva, of which an estimated 1 L is produced every day, and it continuously covers the oral cavity and esophagus. "

"45","human","Of the 48 human chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie 2012), 4 exhibit a predominantly mucosal expression pattern (Hernandez-Ruiz and Zlotnik 2017). "
"46","human","In this study, we have focused on the function of CCL28 through the characterization of its expression pattern in humans as well as the functional characterization of a Ccl28-/mouse. "
"47","human","The first important observation we report in this study is that the main expression site of CCL28 in humans is in the salivary glands (Fig. "
"48","human","This important observation is confirmed by the fact that it is normally abundant in human saliva (Hernandez-Molina and others 2015). "
