"4","fitness","Pollutants directly affect the development, reproductive output and survival of organisms and indirectly affect fitness by increasing disease risk (Figure 1, paths a-b) (Martin et al., 2010; Rohr et al., 2008, 2013). "
"5","fitness","For example, pollutants can decrease immune function and thus decrease resistance to infection (Arkoosh et al., 1998; Koprivnikar, 2010; Rowe, Brundage, Schafer, & Barnett, 2006; Rohr et al., 2008; reviewed in Martin et al., 2010); host resistance reduces parasite damage by reducing parasite fitness (Read, Graham, & Råberg, 2008; Schmid Hempel, 2011). "
"6","fitness","Additionally, exposure to pollutants, such as the herbicide atrazine, can reduce amphibian tolerance of the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) (Rohr et al., 2013); host tolerance minimizes damage caused by parasites without affecting parasite fitness (Medzhitov, Schneider, & Soares, 2012; Miller, White, & Boots, 2006; Råberg, Sim, & Read, 2007; Read et al., 2008). "
"7","fitness","In contrast, gut bacteria, the focus of our study, has been associated with effects on parasite fitness through direct (Koch & SchmidHempel, 2011; Schuijt et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016; Theriot et al., 2014) and indirect pathways, such as by affecting immune system development (Hooper et al., 2012; Round & Mazmanian, 2009). "
"8","fitness","Nonmonotonic dose– response patterns in relation to the fitness and physiology of frogs have been observed in response to other agrochemicals (McMahon et al., 2011; Shelley, Balfry, Ross, & Kennedy, 2009; Storrs & Kiesecker, 2004), but the mechanism underlying this response remains unknown.
