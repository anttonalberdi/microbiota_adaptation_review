"4","fitness","Pollutants directly affect the development, reproductive output and survival of organisms and indirectly affect fitness by increasing disease risk (Figure 1, paths a-b) (Martin et al., 2010; Rohr et al., 2008, 2013). "
"5","fitness","For example, pollutants can decrease immune function and thus decrease resistance to infection (Arkoosh et al., 1998; Koprivnikar, 2010; Rowe, Brundage, Schafer, & Barnett, 2006; Rohr et al., 2008; reviewed in Martin et al., 2010); host resistance reduces parasite damage by reducing parasite fitness (Read, Graham, & Råberg, 2008; Schmid Hempel, 2011). "
"6","fitness","Additionally, exposure to pollutants, such as the herbicide atrazine, can reduce amphibian tolerance of the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) (Rohr et al., 2013); host tolerance minimizes damage caused by parasites without affecting parasite fitness (Medzhitov, Schneider, & Soares, 2012; Miller, White, & Boots, 2006; Råberg, Sim, & Read, 2007; Read et al., 2008). "
"7","fitness","In contrast, gut bacteria, the focus of our study, has been associated with effects on parasite fitness through direct (Koch & SchmidHempel, 2011; Schuijt et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016; Theriot et al., 2014) and indirect pathways, such as by affecting immune system development (Hooper et al., 2012; Round & Mazmanian, 2009). "
"8","fitness","Nonmonotonic dose– response patterns in relation to the fitness and physiology of frogs have been observed in response to other agrochemicals (McMahon et al., 2011; Shelley, Balfry, Ross, & Kennedy, 2009; Storrs & Kiesecker, 2004), but the mechanism underlying this response remains unknown.

"12","disease","Pollutants directly affect the development, reproductive output and survival of organisms and indirectly affect fitness by increasing disease risk (Figure 1, paths a-b) (Martin et al., 2010; Rohr et al., 2008, 2013). "
"13","disease","Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which pollutants affect diseases like Bd in order to mitigate the impact of these factors on hosts. "
"14","disease","One potential mechanism for how pollutants increase disease risk is by altering the symbiotic microbiota of the host (Figure 1, e.g. paths c-e, g-a-b, a-f-e) (Claus, Guillou, & ElleroSimatos, 2016). "
"15","disease","Hostassociated microbiota may not be the only factor mediating the effect of pollutants on disease risk. "
"16","disease","While metyrapone countered atrazineinduced corticosterone elevations, atrazine exposure reduced F I G U R E 1  Potential interactions among anthropogenic factors, such as pollution, hostassociated microbiota and physiology, and disease risk. "
"17","disease","Specifically, we determined whether the abundance of phylum Fusobacteria, which has been shown to affect infectious and noninfectious disease risk (Burns, Lynch, Starr, Knights, & Blekhman, 2015; Knutie, Wilkinson, Kohl, et al., 2017; McCoy et al., 2013; Morton et al., 2015; Scher et al., 2013), affects Bd infection risk. "
"18","disease","In previous studies, higher relative abundance of Fusobacteria was related to lower prevalence of infectious and noninfectious diseases in both human and nonhuman vertebrate hosts (Burns et al., 2015; Knutie, Wilkinson, Kohl, et al., 2017; McCoy et al., 2013; Morton et al., 2015; Scher et al., 2013).

"29","environment","Here, we test whether early-life exposure to the estimated environmental concentration (EEC; 200 μg/L) of atrazine affects the gut bacterial composition of Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) tadpoles and adults and whether any atrazineinduced change in community composition might affect host defences against Bd. "
"30","environment","Many microbes are instrumental in breaking down pollutants in the environment (Figure 1, path g) (Bansal, 2012; Häggblom, 1992; Horvath, 1972; Staley, Harwood, & Rohr, 2015) and thus the contaminants can serve as a resource for microbiota, potentially increasing some of their abundances. "
"31","environment","We hypothesize that exposure to atrazine changes gut bacterial communities of hosts because this pattern has been observed with other pollutants (Figure 1, path c) (Kohl et al., 2015; Shehata et al., 2013; Theriot et al., 2014) and atrazine interacts with bacteria in the environment (Newcombe & Crowley, 1999). "
"32","environment","We randomly assigned each tank to one of four exposure treatments: (1) the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) of atrazine (200 μg/L based on US Environmental Protection Agency GENEEC v2 software; Chemservice; technical grade, purity more than 98%) by dissolving atrazine in 120 μl of ethanol (n = 10), (2) 110 μM of metyrapone (Sigma Chemical Co. "
"33","environment","In the environment, tadpoles could be exposed to atrazine concentrations up to 1,000 μg/L (Graymore, Stagnitti, & Allinson, 2001) and perhaps the EEC concentration that we used was too low to affect bacterial communities. "
