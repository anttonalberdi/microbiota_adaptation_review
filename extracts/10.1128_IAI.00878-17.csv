"4","wild","This trend continues throughout the first month of infection, with colonization by the wild type spreading and that of Che H. pylori maintaining, such that at 2 weeks postinfection, the wild type has colonized 50% of glands and the Che strain has colonized 10%. "
"5","wild","WT BL6 refers to wild type and gp91 refers to Cybb/ mice. "
"6","wild","This finding is consistent with that of Keilberg et al., which showed that wild-type and Che H. pylori strains both initially colonize 5% of glands, with chemotaxis needed to expand to new glands over the following days (5). "
"7","wild","This discrepancy results in wild-type H. pylori occupying 50% of glands at 2 weeks postinfection, and Che strains occupying 10%. "
"8","wild","Only wild-type bacteria, however, are able to expand to a high number of glands, suggesting that both chemotaxis in general and TlpD specifically are needed for this expansion (Fig. "
"9","wild","DUOXA/ mice had a striking phenotype: tlpD mutants now colonized 50% of glands, the same percentage as that of the wild type at 2 weeks of infection (Fig. "
"10","adaptation","Bacteria appear to have special adaptations to the gland niche. "
"11","adaptation","Microbial adaptations that have been reported to aid gland colonization include chemotaxis (5–7), sugar transport systems (4), and the ability to dampen host immune responses (22). "
"12","adaptation","Role of energy sensor TlpD of Helicobacter pylori in gerbil colonization and genome analyses after adaptation in the gerbil. "
"13","mutant","We report here that a Helicobacter pylori cytoplasmic chemoreceptor, TlpD, is required for gland colonization in the stomach. tlpD mutants demonstrate gland colonization defects characterized by a reduction in the percentage of glands colonized but not in the number of bacteria per gland. "
"14","mutant","Consistent with TlpD’s reported role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) avoidance, tlpD mutants showed hallmarks of exposure to high ROS. "
"15","mutant","To assess the role of host-generated ROS in TlpD-dependent gland colonization, we utilized mice that lack either the ability to generate epithelial hydrogen peroxide or immune cell superoxide. tlpD gland colonization defects were rescued to wild-type H. pylori levels in both of these mutants.

"
"17","mutant","The relevance of individual chemoreceptors on overall gastric colonization has been gauged previously by the level of colonization defect that a particular mutant displays. "
"18","mutant","Among individual H. pylori chemoreceptor mutants, tlpD mutants have displayed the most severe colonization attenuation in two animal models of infection (9, 10). "
"19","mutant","The exact nature of the tlpD mutant colonization deficit, however, has remained unclear, as has the role of specific signals and chemoreceptors in gland colonization. "
"20","mutant","H. pylori mutants lacking these systems are sensitive to ROS and are also attenuated in the host (17). "
"21","mutant","ROS production limits colonization of several microbes at epithelial surfaces in the stomach and intestine (16, 18); in agreement with this idea, mouse mutants that lack the epithelial DUOX enzyme produce less H2O2 and allow elevated colonization by a relative of H. pylori, Helicobacter felis (16). "
"22","mutant","Furthermore, tlpD mutants have colonization defects of the bulk epithelia at this time, suggesting that this receptor’s contribution toward H. pylori distribution at the gastric epithelium should be evident (9). "
"23","mutant","We report here that tlpD mutants show specific deficits in colonizing a broad swathe of gastric glands and display hallmarks of exposure to elevated ROS. "
"24","mutant","This result raised the possibility that gland colonization defects could be due to an inability of tlpD mutants to successfully navigate in response to ROS, an idea that was further supported by the observation that tlpD mutants colonized fewer glands than WT H. pylori to elevated densities within these glands. "
"25","mutant","To assess whether host-generated ROS impacted H. pylori colonization, we compared the colonization and distribution levels of the WT and tlpD and nonchemotactic cheY mutant strains in mice deficient in either epithelial dual oxidases Collins et al. "
"26","mutant","Infection of either Duoxa/ or Cybb/ mutant mice rescued the gland colonization defects of the tlpD mutants noted in WT hosts. "
"27","mutant","RESULTS tlpD mutants have minor colonization defects but achieve normal per gland loads. "
"28","mutant","To begin our analysis of TlpD’s role in colonization, we orally infected WT C57BL6 mice with WT or tlpD or cheY mutant variants of H. pylori that each expressed GFP. cheY encodes the central chemotaxis signaling proteins, so mutants that lack it are fully nonchemotactic (Che), while mutants that lack tlpD lose only responses sensed by that receptor and thus are partially chemotactic. "
"29","mutant","After 2 weeks of infection, a time when chemotaxis is needed for gland-gland spread (5), the colonization levels in the total tissue of the stomach corpus and antrum were determined. tlpD mutants showed colonization defects in the antrum and corpus of WT mice (Fig. "
"30","mutant","These results suggested that tlpD GFP-positive (GFP) H. pylori infections behaved similarly to tlpD infections lacking GFP described previously (9) and encouraged the analysis of gland colonization by the mutant. "
"31","mutant","Full loss of chemotaxis (cheY mutants) also resulted in elevated gland loads of 2to 3-fold in both the corpus and the antrum relative to those of WT H. pylori (Fig. "
"32","mutant","Because tlpD and cheY mutants appeared to have altered gland phenotypes, we next analyzed gland occupancy to determine the percentage of glands infected by H. pylori. "
"33","mutant","1C). tlpD mutants showed an 3-fold reduced occupancy in both the corpus and antrum relative to that of WT H. pylori (Fig. "
"34","mutant","1C). cheY mutant gland occupancy was also decreased relative to that of WT H. pylori, with significant reductions in both the corpus and the antrum (Fig. "
"35","mutant","These results suggest that chemotaxis generally, and TlpD specifically, is required for H. pylori to occupy new glands. tlpD mutants show hallmarks of elevated ROS exposure relative to WT H. pylori. "
"36","mutant","Combining this information with our data above suggested that tlpD mutant gland colonization defects could be due to an inability of these mutants to sense and repel themselves away appropriately from ROS. "
"37","mutant","We therefore asked whether tlpD mutants experienced differential oxidative stress in vivo. "
"38","mutant","We next assessed whether the expression of katA mRNA differed between WT and tlpD, and cheY mutant H. pylori bacteria during FIG 1 tlpD mutants have deficits in gland occupancy in WT mice but not in colonization of total tissue or individual glands. "
