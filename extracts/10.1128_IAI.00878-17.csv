"1","wild","To assess the role of host-generated ROS in TlpD-dependent gland colonization, we utilized mice that lack either the ability to generate epithelial hydrogen peroxide or immune cell superoxide. tlpD gland colonization defects were rescued to wild-type H. pylori levels in both of these mutants. "
"2","wild","At 1 day postinfection, wild-type and nonchemotactic H. pylori bacteria both colonize 5 to 10% of gastric glands (5). "
"3","wild","At 3 days postinfection, however, wild-type (WT) H. pylori colonization increases to up to 30% of glands but Received 29 November 2017 Returned for modification 19 January 2018 Accepted 1 March 2018 Accepted manuscript posted online 5 March 2018 Citation Collins KD, Hu S, Grasberger H, Kao JY, Ottemann KM. "
"4","wild","This trend continues throughout the first month of infection, with colonization by the wild type spreading and that of Che H. pylori maintaining, such that at 2 weeks postinfection, the wild type has colonized 50% of glands and the Che strain has colonized 10%. "
"5","wild","WT BL6 refers to wild type and gp91 refers to Cybb/ mice. "
"6","wild","This finding is consistent with that of Keilberg et al., which showed that wild-type and Che H. pylori strains both initially colonize 5% of glands, with chemotaxis needed to expand to new glands over the following days (5). "
"7","wild","This discrepancy results in wild-type H. pylori occupying 50% of glands at 2 weeks postinfection, and Che strains occupying 10%. "
"8","wild","Only wild-type bacteria, however, are able to expand to a high number of glands, suggesting that both chemotaxis in general and TlpD specifically are needed for this expansion (Fig. "
"9","wild","DUOXA/ mice had a striking phenotype: tlpD mutants now colonized 50% of glands, the same percentage as that of the wild type at 2 weeks of infection (Fig. "
"10","adaptation","Bacteria appear to have special adaptations to the gland niche. "
"11","adaptation","Microbial adaptations that have been reported to aid gland colonization include chemotaxis (5â€“7), sugar transport systems (4), and the ability to dampen host immune responses (22). "
"12","adaptation","Role of energy sensor TlpD of Helicobacter pylori in gerbil colonization and genome analyses after adaptation in the gerbil. "
