"9","mutant","1). the ΔspaF mutant lacks the anti-inflammatory, protective, and adhesive properties of the CNCM I-3690 wild type in vitro. "
"10","mutant","In both models, co-incubation with the ΔspaF mutant had no effect (Fig. "
"11","mutant","2D,E) was examined, the CNCM I-3690 was highly adhesive while the ΔspaF mutant was not (103-fold less). "
"12","mutant","3A) while treatment with the ΔspaF mutant did not. "
"13","mutant","Interestingly, treatment with WT, but not with ΔspaF mutant, significantly decreased the levels of IL-6, IFN-β, and IFN-γ (p < 0.05) and increased the level of IL-10 (Fig. "
"14","mutant","The IPA of the specific signaling pathways modulated by the mutant reveals that Δspa F mutant was able to increase G-protein-coupled receptor signaling (especially cAMP-related signaling), as well as ERK/MAPK signaling and phospholipase C signaling (Fig. "
"15","mutant","The ΔspaF mutant was also able to affect glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis. "
"16","mutant","ΔspaF mutant treatment alters Desulfovibrio and Streptococcus populations in the colon. "
"17","mutant","There were five groups of mice: control, untreated, treated with the L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 WT, and treated with L. rhamnosus DspaF mutant and treated with the complemented strain (L. rhamnosus DspaF + spaFED). "
"18","mutant","Genes modulated by the CNCM I-3690 WT versus DNBS-PBS (A) Genes modulated by the CNCM I-3690 WT versus by the DspaF mutant and the major pathways modulated by DspaFmutant as identified via IPA (B). "
"19","mutant","Genes upregulated and downregulated by the DspaFmutant are in red and green, respectively. "
"20","mutant","Similarly, mice with induced low-grade inflammation treated with the ΔspaF mutant did not fully recover as when treated with the WT: their colonic permeability, colonic cytokine levels, GC populations, and lymphocyte populations remained altered. "
"21","mutant","It is worth noting that the ΔspaF mutant was unable to block the NF-κβ pathway, supporting the hypothesized role of this signaling adaptor above. "
"22","mutant","Among the genes modulated by the ΔspaF mutant, the most notable were the genes associated with G-protein-coupled receptor signaling (including cAMP-related signaling), ERK/MAPK signaling, and phospholipase C signaling. "
"23","mutant","This fact, combined with the absence of TIFA upregulation, could explain the failure of the ΔspaF mutant to block inflammation. "
"24","mutant","We observed that mice treated with the ΔspaF mutant had different microbiota than mice treated with the WT strain; namely, there was an increase in Desulfobivrio species and a decrease in Streptococcus species. "
"25","mutant","L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 wild type (WT), the isogenic DspaF mutant and the complemented strain were cultured in MRS medium (Difco, USA) at 37 °C under aerobic conditions. "

"27","mutant","The result was the DspaF mutant. "
"28","mutant","The resulting plasmid, pDN142, was introduced into the DspaF mutant to obtain the DspaF + spaFDE strain (selection at 30 °C on 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol medium). "
"29","mutant","The two other groups were treated with 5 × 109 CFU of viable bacteria in PBS (200 µl); one was given the CNCM I-3690 WT (hereafter, the CNCM I-3690-treated group) and the other was given the ΔspaF mutant (hereafter, the ΔspaF-treated group). "
