"3","wild","C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice (8-10 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and acclimated for 1 week prior to any matings or experiments. "
"4","wild","Mice were infected with streptomycin-resistant wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 (S.Tm) through the oro-gastric route using a modified protocol of streptomycin pre-treatment and bacterial gavage (21,38). "

"6","model","S.Tm infection in mice is an established model of human typhoid fever due to similarities in intestinal pathology, bacterial growth characteristics, tissue distribution and overall systemic disease (8). "
"7","model","All rights reserved In experimental models, initiation of infection by the intravenous route allows for the direct study of systemic infection. "
"8","model","An effective oral infection model in mice was previously established by pre-treating mice with oral streptomycin prior to gavage with streptomycin-resistant Salmonella, to allow for consistent gut colonization by S.Tm (19,20). "
"9","model","Thus, oral infection in combination with streptomycin pre-treatment provides a suitable model for examining pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation and systemic disease (23). "
"10","model","Results and Discussion The use of an oral infection model has the potential to provide insight into the mechanisms involved in S.Tm trafficking from the gut to the placenta via the natural route of infection. "
"11","model","Mouse models demonstrate that S.Tm infection in the gut results in inflammation, thereby allowing A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright. "
"12","model","However, this dose may not be directly applicable to mouse models due to genetic differences relative to humans (i.e., mouse-specific TLR11 expression) that may impact host susceptibility to Salmonella infection (44). "
"13","model","We first standardized an oral gavage model of S.Tm infection in non-pregnant and pregnant hosts to ensure consistent systemic and placental infection. "
"14","model","Taken together, our data suggest that oral infection of WT mice with S.Tm induced neutrophil-mediated placental damage, consistent with our previous intravenous infection model (37). "
"15","model","We previously showed in our intravenous infection model that the protection conferred by IFNAR1 deficiency against S.Tm in the non-pregnant state was abrogated during pregnancy (49). "
"16","model","A similar methodology can be adapted to our oral infection model to examine the impact of fetal versus maternal IFNAR signaling on pregnancy outcomes during S.Tm infection. "
"17","model","We show in our bacterial infection model that dysregulation of select cell death pathways, either by innate immune responses or possibly as a result of host-pathogen interactions, also modulates placental dysfunction and fetal-placental demise. "

"25","disease","S.Tm infection in mice is an established model of human typhoid fever due to similarities in intestinal pathology, bacterial growth characteristics, tissue distribution and overall systemic disease (8). "
"26","disease","Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages can also contribute to systemic disease by harboring live bacteria from the gut wall and migrating to distant sites (9,12– 15). "
"27","disease","Thus, oral infection in combination with streptomycin pre-treatment provides a suitable model for examining pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation and systemic disease (23). "
"28","disease","In another study, we demonstrated that maternal disease progression and placental pathology in mice infected intravenously with S.Tm were associated with profound neutrophil influx in placental tissues (37). "
"29","disease","However, an overt cytokine storm associated with Salmonella proliferation during pregnancy contributes to maternal and fetal disease progression (37). "

"31","disease","The relative contributions of Nramp expression in modulating maternal and fetal disease progression during S.Tm infection remain to be elucidated. "

"41","human","A wide array of commensal bacteria colonize the human gut and assist in gut homeostasis, as well as create a barrier against invading pathogens by competing with pathogens for nutrients and preventing pathogen adherence to the intestinal epithelium (20,41). "
"42","human","The dose of nontyphoidal Salmonella generally considered to cause gastroenteritis in healthy human individuals is ~105 to 106 CFUs, which may be even further decreased in susceptible populations such as pregnant women (43). "
"43","human","However, this dose may not be directly applicable to mouse models due to genetic differences relative to humans (i.e., mouse-specific TLR11 expression) that may impact host susceptibility to Salmonella infection (44). "
