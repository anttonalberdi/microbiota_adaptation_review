"1","wild","Gastric cancer developed in 50% of gerbils infected with the wild-type strain 7.13 but in none of the animals infected with the hyd strain. "
"2","wild","In a gerbil model of infection, we observed that the hyd strain produces a significantly lower level of inflammation than wild-type (WT) strain 7.13, further supporting the notion that hydrogen metabolism plays an important role in the etiology of Helicobacter-mediated gastric cancer. "
"3","wild","Using acnB:: Kan as the donor DNA, wild-type H. pylori strain 7.13 had a transformation frequency of 1.27  105. "
"4","wild","Multiple cohorts of male Mongolian gerbils, ages 5 to 7 weeks, were orogastrically challenged with H. pylori wild-type strain 7.13 or isogenic mutant strain 7.13 hyd (109 CFU/gerbil) and were euthanized 2, 6, or 12 weeks postinoculation. "
"5","adaptation","In studying H. pylori-induced cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model, a carcinogenic H. pylori strain, 7.13, was selected from in vivo adaptation of noncarcinogenic strain B128 (15). "
"6","adaptation","DISCUSSION In studying H. pylori-induced cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model, a carcinogenic H. pylori strain, 7.13, was selected from in vivo adaptation of noncarcinogenic strain B128 (15). "
"7","mutant","A hyd mutant strain with deletion of hydrogenase genes was ineffective in CagA translocation into human gastric epithelial AGS cells, while no significant attenuation of cell adhesion was observed. "
"8","mutant","A hydrogenase mutant strain of H. pylori is much less efficient in establishing colonization in mice (at 3 weeks postinoculation) (17). "
"9","mutant","The 7.13 hyd hydrogenase deletion mutant strain has almost lost the ability to translocate CagA into host cells, suggesting that H. pylori hydrogen metabolism may induce gastric cancer via promotion of CagA translocation. "
"10","mutant","To test this hypothesis, we assayed CagA translocation for strains 26695 (reference strain), B128, and 7.13, as well as the 7.13 hyd mutant strain (Fig. "
"11","mutant","The hyd mutant strain has almost lost the ability to translocate CagA into AGS cells, indicating that hydrogenase activity plays an important role in CagA translocation into host cells. "
"12","mutant","The bacterial adherence assay with AGS cells revealed no significant difference between the binding abilities of the hyd mutant strain and its parent strain, 7.13 (data not shown). "
"13","mutant","H. pylori cells (7.13 WT or 7.13 hyd mutant) were first treated for 10 min with the sublethal dose (3 mg/ml) of lactoferrin to permeabilize the outer membrane (23), thus facilitating the access of HQNO to hydrogenase at the cytoplasmic membrane and periplasm-facing components. "
"14","mutant","As expected, the 7.13 hyd mutant strain translocated a very small amount of CagA into AGS cells, either with or without the HQNO treatment. "
"15","mutant","To test if H. pylori hydrogen metabolism also plays a role in facilitating ComB function, we compared the DNA transformation frequency of the 7.13 hyd mutant strain to that of WT 7.13. "
"16","mutant","Using rpoB3 as the donor DNA, the 7.13 hyd mutant had a transformation frequency of 3.89  105, which was approximately 8-fold lower than that for the 7.13 WT strain (3.27  104). "
"17","mutant","(B) Lysates of AGS cells after coculture with the permeabilized H. pylori 7.13 WT or hyd mutant strain in the absence or presence of 0.5 M HQNO were used for Western blot analysis using anti-CagA antibody. "
"18","mutant","12 8. tion frequency for the 7.13 hyd mutant was 1.4  106, which is 9-fold lower than that of the WT strain. "
"19","mutant","For both types of DNA donor (rpoB3 and acnB::Kan), the mutant strain data (transformation frequency) are significantly lower than those of the WT strain, according to Studentâ€™s t test (P  0.01). "
"20","mutant","In this study, we assessed the effects of H2 use on H. pylori colonization and inflammation in gerbils by comparing the 7.13 parent to its hyd isogenic mutant strain. "
"21","mutant","At 2 and 6 weeks, very low levels of inflammation were observed in gerbils, and the difference between WT 7.13 and hyd mutant strain infection was not statistically significant (Fig. 3, lower panel). "
"22","mutant","Mongolian gerbils were inoculated with the H. pylori 7.13 WT or hyd mutant strain, and the stomachs were examined 2, 6, and 12 weeks after inoculation. "
"23","mutant","Representative H&E-stained panels are shown for 12 weeks postinfection with the H. pylori 7.13 WT or hyd mutant strain. "
"24","mutant","No dysplasia or adenocarcinoma developed in gerbils infected with the 7.13 hyd mutant strain. "
"25","mutant","The cag PAI-positive strains are implicated in the increased release of various inflammatory cytokines from the host cells, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) (67), whereas an isogenic mutant with a defect in T4SS is unable to elicit this response (68). "
"26","mutant","Chloramphenicol (50 g/ml) was added to the medium for culturing mutants. "
"27","mutant","Construction of the H. pylori 7.13 hyd mutant. "
"28","mutant","Construction of H. pylori hyd mutants in strains 26695 and 43504 was previously described (49). "
"29","mutant","Briefly, overlapping PCR and allele-exchange mutagenesis were used to generate the hyd deletion mutant, in which the entire hyd operon (hydABCDE [genes hp0631 to hp0635 in strain 26695]) was deleted and replaced by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) cassette. "
"30","mutant","In this study, the DNA construct was used to transform strain 7.13 to obtain the 7.13 hyd mutant. "
"31","mutant","Multiple cohorts of male Mongolian gerbils, ages 5 to 7 weeks, were orogastrically challenged with H. pylori wild-type strain 7.13 or isogenic mutant strain 7.13 hyd (109 CFU/gerbil) and were euthanized 2, 6, or 12 weeks postinoculation. "
"32","model","In a gerbil model of infection, the ability of the hyd strain to induce inflammation was significantly attenuated (at 12 weeks postinoculation), while all of the gerbils infected with the parent strain (7.13) exhibited a high level of inflammation. "
"33","model","The role of hydrogenase in carcinogenesis is demonstrated in an animal model, whereby inflammation markers and cancer development were attenuated in the hydrogenase-null strain. "
"34","model","This has been confirmed by animal model experiments with Mongolian gerbils (13, 14). "
"35","model","In studying H. pylori-induced cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model, a carcinogenic H. pylori strain, 7.13, was selected from in vivo adaptation of noncarcinogenic strain B128 (15). "
"36","model","Strain B128 is cagA positive, but it does not cause cancer in the gerbil model, unlike its derivative strain, 7.13 (15). "
"37","model","In a gerbil model of infection, we observed that the hyd strain produces a significantly lower level of inflammation than wild-type (WT) strain 7.13, further supporting the notion that hydrogen metabolism plays an important role in the etiology of Helicobacter-mediated gastric cancer. "
"38","model","Hydrogen metabolism of H. pylori affects carcinogenesis in an animal model. "
"39","model","For testing H. pylori infection and gastric cancer development, the Mongolian gerbil model is well established. "
"40","model","H. pylori strain 7.13 was shown to have a much higher ability (than parental strain B128) to induce gastric cancer in this animal model, and the development of gastric dysplasia and adenocarcinoma is dependent on the bacterial virulence factor CagA (14, 15). "
"41","model","To increase the significance of the results beyond the B128 and 7.13 model strains, we examined the hydrogenase activities as well as CagA status for other clinical H. pylori isolates from persons residing in Honduras, Central America, and in Japan. "
"42","model","DISCUSSION In studying H. pylori-induced cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model, a carcinogenic H. pylori strain, 7.13, was selected from in vivo adaptation of noncarcinogenic strain B128 (15). "
