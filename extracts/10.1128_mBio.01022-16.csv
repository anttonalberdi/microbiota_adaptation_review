"1","wild","Gastric cancer developed in 50% of gerbils infected with the wild-type strain 7.13 but in none of the animals infected with the hyd strain. "
"2","wild","In a gerbil model of infection, we observed that the hyd strain produces a significantly lower level of inflammation than wild-type (WT) strain 7.13, further supporting the notion that hydrogen metabolism plays an important role in the etiology of Helicobacter-mediated gastric cancer. "
"3","wild","Using acnB:: Kan as the donor DNA, wild-type H. pylori strain 7.13 had a transformation frequency of 1.27  105. "
"4","wild","Multiple cohorts of male Mongolian gerbils, ages 5 to 7 weeks, were orogastrically challenged with H. pylori wild-type strain 7.13 or isogenic mutant strain 7.13 hyd (109 CFU/gerbil) and were euthanized 2, 6, or 12 weeks postinoculation. "
"5","adaptation","In studying H. pylori-induced cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model, a carcinogenic H. pylori strain, 7.13, was selected from in vivo adaptation of noncarcinogenic strain B128 (15). "
"6","adaptation","DISCUSSION In studying H. pylori-induced cancer in a Mongolian gerbil model, a carcinogenic H. pylori strain, 7.13, was selected from in vivo adaptation of noncarcinogenic strain B128 (15). "
