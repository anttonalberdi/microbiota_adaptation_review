"1","wild","Mice were infected via the oral route with wild type S. "
"2","wild","Tm strains (‘‘WITS’’, wild-type isogenic tagged strains), which can be individually tracked by quantitative real-time PCR. "
"3","wild","Tm strains chromosomally tagged with bar coded sequences (WITS, wild-type isogenic tagged strains; [5,6,29]) we identified a pronounced bottleneck in the gut luminal pathogen population and oligo-clonal expansion post crisis. "
"4","wild","Tm community composition by using seven wild-type isogenic tagged S. "
"5","wild","The ‘‘1:70’’, 1:700’’ and ‘‘1:7000’’ inocula were generated by diluting the original WITS mixture with an untagged, isogenic wild type strain (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000, respectively). "
"6","wild","Nevertheless, the WITS-diversity was only slightly reduced by day 4 p.i., suggesting that the tight bottleneck observed in wild type S. "
"7","wild","In line with earlier data, the mucosa featured a ‘‘patchy’’ distribution of inflammatory foci typical for the ‘‘SPI-2 mediated’’ disease [19,36] which was even at day 4 p.i. significantly less pronounced than the inflammation elicited by wild type S. "
"8","wild","Here, inflammation was much milder than the pathology elicited by wild type S. "
"9","wild","The inflammation elicited by wild type S. "
"10","wild","Tm will affect all bacteria present in the gut lumen (i.e. wild type and mutant [20,38–42]). "
"11","wild","In particular, we wanted to assess the evenness index of WITSSPI-2 in the face of full blown mucosal inflammation elicited by wild type S. "
"12","wild","To this end, we mixed WITSSPI-2 with an excess of wild type S. "
"13","wild","TmWT) and cecum pathological scoring confirmed an overall ‘‘wild type’’-like intestinal disease progression during this mixed infection experiment (Fig. "
"14","wild","In fact, the evenness index at day 4 p.i. was strikingly similar to that of wild type WITS (median = 0.033 and 0.044; see Fig. "
"15","wild","Typhimurium loads as efficiently as the wild type animals. "
"16","wild","In the case of wild type S. "
"17","wild","Materials and Methods Bacterial strains The wild type strain SB300 is a clone of S. "
"18","wild","Tm strains (WITS = wild type isogenic tagged strains) in equal proportions. "
"19","wild","Selective sweep by such mutants with higher fitness than wild type S. "
"20","wild","Five out of six re-isolates had competitive index (C.I.) values of 1, indicating that they featured equivalent fitness than the wild type strain (and a naı̈ve ‘‘control’’ WITS strain). "
"21","fitness","These observations provided additional evidence that all WITS had equivalent fitness in our model and suggested that the diversity is reduced by a stochastic process. "
"22","fitness","These control experiments verified that (in general), the dominant WITS-isolates retained the fitness of the original strain (S3 Figure). "
"23","fitness","This model assumes that there are no fitness differences between WITS and that the population bottleneck is effective for only a short time. "
"24","fitness","Competitive infection experiments to test for increased fitness of re-isolated strains were performed by infecting streptomycin-pretreated mice with equal amounts of S. "
"25","fitness","To exclude that fitness-enhancing mutants might confound our analysis, we performed competitive infection experiments with clones re-isolated at day 4 p.i. "
"26","fitness","Selective sweep by such mutants with higher fitness than wild type S. "
"27","fitness","Tm mutants with increased fitness can indeed be selected during within-host evolution [39]. "
"28","fitness","To test their relative fitness, streptomycin pretreated C57BL/6 mice were infected with a 1:1 mixture of the re-isolate and of the isogenic original S. "
"29","fitness","We compared the fitness of the isolate to a ‘‘control’’ strain, i.e. a naı̈ve WITS strain as used for inoculum preparation in our infection experiments. "
"30","fitness","Five out of six re-isolates had competitive index (C.I.) values of 1, indicating that they featured equivalent fitness than the wild type strain (and a naı̈ve ‘‘control’’ WITS strain). "
"31","fitness","Andersson DI, Hughes D (1996) Muller’s ratchet decreases fitness of a DNAbased microbe. "
"32","adaptation","(2014) The first steps of adaptation of Escherichia coli to the gut are dominated by soft sweeps. "
