"1","wild","Three of the species—L. animalis, L. reuteri, and provisionally-named species “L. peromysci”—were identified in fecal metagenomes of wild P. leucopus but not discernibly in samples from M. musculus. "
"2","wild","L. johnsonii, the fourth species, was common in M. musculus but absent or sparse in wild P. leucopus. "
"3","wild","René Dubos, 1981 [1, 2] Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed deermouse, is one of the most abundant wild mammals in central and eastern United States and adjacent regions of Canada and Mexico [3, 4]. "
"4","wild","Its wide geographic range extends from rural areas to suburbs and even cities, and it is especially common in areas where humans and wildland areas interface [5]. "
"5","wild","Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. and the stock colony animals revealed several species in common, albeit with larger variance among the wild animals. "
"6","wild","MIT 05–5293 (accession JROZ02000000), which had been cultivated from a wild P. leucopus captured in Massachusetts ([48]; J.G. "
"7","wild","Baxter et al. reported “abundant representatives” of the genus Helicobacter in wild P. maniculatus and P. leucopus captured in Michigan [22]. "
"8","wild","Intestinal flagellated protozoa named “Trichomonas muris” or “Tritrichomonas muris” had previously been identified in wild P. leucopus and P. maniculatus [56]. "
"9","wild","As related below, there is sequence evidence of the same or related organism in several wild animals. "
"10","wild","The LL stock P. leucopus were outbred but the effective population size was small compared to a wild population [18]. "
"11","wild","An example would be the Helicobacter species that was highly variable in prevalence in both the wild animals and the stock colony animals. "
"12","wild","Draft genome sequences of eight enterohepatic Helicobacter species isolated from both laboratory and wild rodents. "
"13","fitness","Wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. "
"14","adaptation","This adaptation and its susceptibilities to commonly-used antibiotics may make it a candidate as a vector for delivering oral vaccines to this species [30]. "
"15","adaptation","Whether this is an indication of a restricted host range or a specific adaptation for this Table 2. "
"16","adaptation","Hydrogenosomes: eukaryotic adaptations to anaerobic environments. "
"17","inbred","To further understanding of P. leucopus’ total genomic content, we investigated gut microbiomes of an outbred colony of P. leucopus, inbred M. musculus, and a natural population of P. leucopus. "
"18","inbred","A limitation to the study was that the LL stock animals were outbred, and the BALB/c mice were inbred. "
"19","inbred","An inbred lineage derived from the LL stock population was not available. "
"20","inbred","On the other hand, this distinction provided a comparison of microbiome diversities between an outbred and inbred population. "
"21","inbred","As expected, there was greater alpha diversity among the outbred samples than the inbred (Fig 10). "
"22","inbred","Alpha diversity (left) and beta diversity (right) of gut metagenomes of outbred Peromyscus leucopus (green), a natural population of P. leucopus (blue), and inbredMus musculus (red). "
"23","inbred","Fig 10 compares the alpha diversity by Shannon index and beta diversity by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of the inbred BALB/c M. musculus, outbred LL stock P. leucopus, and the natural population of P. leucopus of Block Island. "
"24","model","P. leucopus differs in its social behavior and reproductive physiology from rodents that are traditional experimental models [13, 14]. "
"25","model","P. leucopus’ importance as a pathogen reservoir, its resilience in the face of infection, and its appealing features as an animal model [6, 16], prompted our genetic characterization of this species, beginning with sequencing and annotating its nuclear and mitochondrial genomes [17, 18]. "
