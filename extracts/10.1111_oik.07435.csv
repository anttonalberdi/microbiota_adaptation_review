"1","wild","Here, we used 265 published diets from 87 European studies to investigate patterns of resource use by four common deer species (moose Alces alces, red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and fallow deer Dama dama), and wild boar Sus scrofa at the continental scale. "
"2","wild","The European moose Alces alces population, for example, increased by approximately 200% from 1960 to 2005, roe deer Capreolus capreolus by 250%, and that of red deer Cervus elaphus and wild boar Sus scrofa by 400% (Deinet et al. "
"3","wild","Under such novel conditions, balancing the ecosystem services provided by ungulates (e.g. meat provision, hunting opportunities, or rooting/forest pest reduction by wild boar) with adverse socio-economic impacts (e.g. damage to crops and forests (Bleier et al. 2012), and traffic collisions (Björnstig et al. 1986)), poses an enormous challenge (Linnell  et  al. "
"4","wild","The degree to which browse and grasses are utilized by wild herbivores is of particular interest since these food groups often represent shared resources with humans. "
"5","wild","In this study, we therefore aim to assess the applicability of feeding types across large spatio–temporal gradients by using published diets of four ruminants (moose, roe deer, red deer and fallow deer Dama dama) and one hindgut fermenter (wild boar) to characterize species-level diet 1670 composition. "
"6","wild","We chose these species because they occur widely throughout the continent and are driving most of the human–wildlife conflicts mentioned earlier. "
"7","wild","Although the omnivorous wild boar does not fit within the classification of ruminant feeding types, we included it in our analyses because it is a key component of the current European ungulate community and utilizes many of the same plant food resources as ruminants (Genov 1981). "
"8","wild","The diet of hindgut-fermenting, omnivorous wild boar should be distant from the ruminant deer even within the context of shared food categories, but the directionality of diet changes from the growing season to winter should be the same for all five ungulate species, i.e. towards woody browse. "
"9","wild","Consumption of animal matter by wild boar should be a major distinguishing factor from deer species. "
"10","wild","Material and methods Diet composition data set We searched the Web of Science Core Collection for publications from 1965 to 2016 using the Boolean search terms: Topic: (moose OR ‘red deer’ OR ‘roe deer’ OR ‘fallow deer’ OR ‘wild boar’) AND (diet* OR food* OR forage*). "
"11","wild","To investigate the separation of the deer species and wild boar in terms of their use of grasses, woody browse and other food items, we used equilateral mixture triangles (EMT, Raubenheimer 2011). "
"12","wild","Finally, we assessed the difference between ruminants and non-ruminants as 3 (cervids – wild boar). "
"13","wild","Grass consumption by wild boar was in between roe deer and red deer (~ 20% during the growing season and winter) but utilization of browse was generally much lower than for any of the cervids. "
"14","wild","The feeding niche of wild boar separated from the cervids during the growing season and only minimally overlapped in winter. "
"15","wild","The omnivorous, hindgut-fermenting wild boar Figure 4. "
"16","wild","There was a negative correlation between difference in feeding type and diet similarity during the growing season (rp = −0.45, < 0.001) and winter (rp = −0.46, p < 0.001), i.e. the greater the difference between species (e.g. ruminant deer and non-ruminant wild boar) the less similar their diets. "
"17","wild","Although wild boar frequently consumed grasses in proportions similar to those of red deer, their diets contained very little browse and instead higher amounts of fruits, seeds and crops. "
"18","wild","The reported proportions of non-plant foods in wild boar diets were typically less than 10%, and thus a less important differentiator than we expected (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A1). "
"19","wild","Season Species Mean diet similarity (95% CI) Growing season moose 0.76 (0.72–0.80) fallow deer 0.68 (0.61–0.75) red deer 0.58 (0.57–0.60) roe deer 0.53 (0.52–0.54) wild boar 0.49 (0.34–0.63) Winter fallow deer 0.74 (0.65–0.83) moose 0.70 (0.63–0.77) red deer 0.56 (0.54–0.57) roe deer 0.53 (0.51–0.55) wild boar 0.30 (0.14–0.46) 1676 farmlands and deciduous forests. "
"20","wild","Our review confirmed this relatively high use of agricultural crop plants, in farmland habitats, by roe deer and wild boar. "
"21","wild","These may be biased towards habitats in which a given species of interest is most common such as wild boar in agricultural areas in the context of crop damage. "
"22","wild","Roe deer, on the contrary, utilized all the food categories even more variably than red deer and thus had the lowest intraspecific values for Pianka’s index (diet similarity) of all cervids but still higher than for the omnivorous wild boar. "
"23","wild","As these tree species form a shared resource between humans and ungulates, it might be advisable to evaluate limits in their availability to ungulates not only in terms of natural constraints (e.g. site productivity, growth rate, tolerance to damage and regenerative capacity) but also from the angle of wildlife acceptance capacity (Decker and Purdy 1988), i.e. the level of ungulate damage that is acceptable before ungulates are either reduced in number through hunting or their access to forage artificially restricted through measures such as fencing.

"34","adaptation","Confusion over feeding types can arise if it is unclear whether classifications are meant to refer to the botanical composition of diets or the morphophysiological adaptations of ruminant species. "
"35","adaptation","It has been well established that relationships between morphophysiological traits and the efficacy of utilizing grass and browse exist (for comprehensive reviews see Clauss et al. 2008 and Codron et al. 2019) but such relationships should not be interpreted in the sense that a given adaptation is exclusively suitable for a specific diet (Clauss and Hofmann 2014). "
"36","adaptation","This result supports the view that ruminants with a ‘moose-type’ digestion have a low threshold in % grass intake above which their digestion is less efficient, due to the morphophysiological adaptations of the digestive tract (Codron et al. "
