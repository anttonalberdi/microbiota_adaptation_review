"1","wild","(2019) 53: 1–11 DOI:10.1111/izy.12230 Skin bacterial microflora of two closely related mountain newts (Salamandridae) – the Yellowspotted mountain newt Neurergus derjugini and the Kaiser’s mountain newt Neurergus kaiseri – in the wild and in a breeding facility highlight new conservation perspectives S. "
"2","wild","In this study, skin bacterial microbiota of wild adults and individuals of both species from a captive-breeding facility (CBF) were compared. "
"3","wild","Four bacteria that naturally occur on the skin of wild adult N. derjugini were identified (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli). "
"4","wild","Six bacteria were positively detected on the skin of wild adult N. kaiseri [S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. cereus, E. coli, Rhodococcus equi, Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes]. "
"5","wild","Our results indicate that the skin microbiota of F1 offspring (≤ 2 months of age) from the CBF did not correspond exactly to the microbial community identified in wild adult N. derjugini. "
"6","wild","However, ≥ 75% of the bacteria found in older individuals (≥ 1 year of age) living at the CBF over the long term corresponded to those of their wild counterparts. "
"7","wild","INTRODUCTION Since the 1980s, the global decline of wildlife populations has occurred at an astounding rate, with a significant rate of extinction in amphibian communities (Stuart et al., 2004; MacCulloch, 2008; Hernandez, 2016). "
"8","wild","Further studies are needed to identify variations in skin and gut microbiota on ex situ individuals and how these differ from conspecifics living in the wild, as well as what impact these variations have on long-term conservation of species (Woodworth et al., 2002; Becker et al., 2014; Jimenez & Sommer, 2017). "
"9","wild","The latter study confirmed significant seasonal changes in skin microbial communities of adult Lowland leopard frogs Lithobates (Rana) yavapaiensis in the wild, which had higher richness and abundance in winter when the amphibians were more susceptible to infection by Batrachochytrium spp (Longo et al., 2015). "
"10","wild","In all these studies, the amphibians developed a reduced diversity of skin bacteria in contrast with specimens studied in the wild. "
"11","wild","However, the Panamanian golden frog Atelopus zeteki has been also kept in captivity for conservation purposes and revealed a higher bacterial alpha diversity than wild individuals (Becker et al., 2014). "
"12","wild","Yellow-spotted mountain newt Neurergus derjugini in the wild at Kavat, Kermanshah, Iran. "
"13","wild","Kaiser's mountain newt Neurergus kaiseri in the wild at LabSefid, Khuzestan, Iran. "
"14","wild","In this study, for the first time, we assess the microorganisms that naturally occur on the skin of N. derjugini living in the wild and compare them with microorganisms found on the skin of F1 offspring reared at the CBF. "
"15","wild","Additionally, the natural bacterial microflora of the N. kaiseri was identified in adults from the wild and compared with those maintained at the breeding facility. "
"16","wild","Sampling for bacterial isolation For bacterial identification of wild newts, 50 adult N. derjugini [19.31 (♂♂.♀♀)] were collected from Kavat stream (34°520N, 046°300E) during the breeding season (spring 2017) in Kermanshah province, Iran. "
"17","wild","After swabbing, animals were returned to their site of capture if they had been wild caught or to their enclosures at the CBF. "
"18","wild","RESULTS Table 1 shows the individual bacterial species isolated from the 19.31 wild adult N. derjugini, as well as the Mannitol Salt Agar results for 115 larvae and newts in different age groups originating from the CBF (i.e. 2 month-old larvae, and newts of 1, 3, 5 and 7 years). "
"19","wild","Positive identifications were made for four bacteria that naturally occur on the skin in the wild: that is, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. "
"20","wild","For N. kaiseri, five bacterial species were isolated from both the 23.27 wild adults and 12.13 adults (> 7 years of age) originating from the CBF (i.e. "
"21","wild","Another bacteria, Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes, was positively identified in the wild individuals but not found on those from the CBF, while S. arizonae was isolated only from CBF adults (Table 1). "
"22","wild","Despite a widely recognized need for microbiome research to be placed in a more ecological context – especially as it applies to wildlife conservation – few efforts have been made to integrate these fields, especially in a way that might actually address current management practices (Trevelline et al., 2019). "
"23","wild","Therefore, the proper functioning of this symbiotic interaction between bacteria and amphibians is vital for amphibians in human care, especially those that are destined to be released into the wild (Passos et al., 2018). "
"24","wild","Comparing the skin microbiota of wild and captive newts of the same species should provide a better understanding of whether captive-bred newts are fit for reintroduction. "
"25","wild","In this study, we investigated and compared the bacterial microbiota on the skin of wild and captive-bred individuals of two threatened species of Neurergus. "
"26","wild","However, it is worth noting that wild larvae of these species were not tested for skin bacterial microbiota. "
"27","wild","If wild larvae had been tested there may have been different results. "
"28","wild","One species of bacteria (B. cereus) was present in almost all age classes of newts originating from the CBF and was also found in wild individuals. "
"29","wild","Positively identified skin microflora isolated from the skin of Yellow-spotted mountain newt Neurergus derjugini and Kaiser's mountain newt Neurergus kaiseri in the wild and at the captive-breeding facility (CBF) at Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran. "
"30","wild","Neurergus derjugini: natural habitat (wild), n = 19.31 (♂.♀) adults; CBF, n = 20 2 month-old larvae, n = 15 1 year-old newts, n = 20 3 year-old newts, n = 20 5 year-old newts, n = 40 7 year-old newts. "
"31","wild","Neurergus kaiseri: natural habitat (wild), n = 23.27 adults; CBF, n = 12.13 adults (> 7 years of age). "
"32","wild","(2019) 53: 1–11 © 2019 The Zoological Society of London 6 THE DEVELOPING ZOO WORLD Various age cohorts of newts from the CBF (i.e. 1, 3 and 5 year-old newts) shared ≥ 75% of the bacteria present in the wild individuals. "
"33","wild","However, in the Bataille et al. (2016) study, levels of bacterial richness and diversity, and bacterial-community composition, were more similar among the captive populations compared to the wild population sampled. "
"34","wild","According to Becker et al. (2014), the species richness, phylogenetic diversity and community structure of the skin microbiota were significantly different between wild and captive golden frogs. "
"35","wild","However, after living c. 8 years in human care, the offspring of the original captive golden frogs still shared 70% of their microbial community with wild frogs (Becker et al., 2014). "
"36","wild","(2019) 53: 1–11 © 2019 The Zoological Society of London MOUNTAIN NEWTS: SKIN BACTERIAL MICROFLORA 7 studies of marine sponges maintained in facilities for short periods of time (> 6 months) had very similar surface microbial communities to wild-caught sponges (Gerce et al., 2009; Webster et al., 2011). "
"37","wild","However, after 12 months in human care, sponges had a very different symbiotic community structure when compared with wild-caught sponges, whereby many wildassociated microbes had been lost altogether and new or rare microbes had become dominant (Webster et al., 2011). "
"38","wild","Our study shows that during short periods of time (≤ 2 months) only 25% of the microbial community had similar surface microbial communities to wild-caught newts (B. cereus) but in the long term (≥ 12 months) the microbial community had very similar surface microbial communities to wild-caught newts (S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. cereus and E. coli). "
"39","wild","Furthermore, Culp et al. (2007) isolated the natural bacterial flora on the skin of apparently healthy wild adult Eastern newts Notophthalmus viridescens, larval American bullfrogs Lithobates catesbeianus and Eastern red-back salamanders P. cinereus living in their natural habitats within Virginia, USA. "
"40","wild","This study has identified four species of microflora that routinely occur on the skin of wild N. derjugini (S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. cereus and E. coli) and six on the skin of wild N. kaiseri (S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. cereus, R. equi, E. coli and K. aerogenes). "
