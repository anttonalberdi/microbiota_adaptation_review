"8","wild","Total SCFA levels were similar in fecal samples from wild-caught and captiveborn Gorilla gorilla (Tables IX and X), although concentrations of acetate were significantly greater (p=0.002, F=48.72) in fecal samples from wild-caught gorillas. "

"10","wild","An evaluation of the data presented here in light of information stemming from the literature on wild and captive catarrhines (with domesticated cattle and one platyrrhine species for comparison) suggests that fecal samples from colobine and cercopithecine species produce relatively high total SCFA concentrations in vitro, even when compared to in vitro samples from the much larger-bodied pongid species (Table XI).
