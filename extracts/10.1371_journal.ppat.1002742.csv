"1","wild","A. gambiae mosquitoes collected in natural breeding sites from Cameroon were experimentally challenged with a wild P. falciparum isolate, and their gut bacterial content was submitted for pyrosequencing analysis. "
"2","wild","Interestingly, Cirimotich et al. [24] recently described an Enterobacter bacterium isolated from wild mosquitoes in Zambia that confers refractoriness to P. falciparum infection. "
"3","wild","Here, we challenged wild female mosquitoes with a natural isolate of P. falciparum, thereby offering an opportunity to examine natural bacteria/parasite associations. "
"4","wild","For mosquito NKD97, S2 and S3 primer sets only allowed the identification at the Enterobacteriaceae family level, whereas S1 reached the assignment at the genus level, Serratia. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002742.g001 Anopheles gambiae Midgut Microbiota PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002742 Anopheles gambiae Midgut Microbiota PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002742 microbiota in laboratory-reared mosquitoes as compared with mosquitoes from the wild. "
"5","wild","Proteobacteria represented more than 90% of the bacterial gut content in the mosquitoes from the wild, whereas in laboratoryreared mosquitoes, more than 95% of sequence tags belonged to the Flavobacteria Elizabethkingia spp. "
"6","wild","The drastic loss of microbial diversity from the wild to laboratory conditions may have important consequences on mosquito fitness and on the gut immune system. "
"7","wild","Despite a larger diversity of the gut microbiota in wild mosquitoes, most bacteria species are sparsely distributed between individual mosquitoes. "
"8","wild","This Enterobacter strain was isolated in Zambia from wild-caught A. arabiensis mosquitoes, and differences in the mosquito species, as well as differences between the study areas, may explain why we did not find this bacterium in our material. "
"9","wild","Therefore, it would be of interest to examine the presence/abundance of Esp_Z in wild-caught Zambian A. arabiensis using the methodologies described here. "
"10","fitness","The drastic loss of microbial diversity from the wild to laboratory conditions may have important consequences on mosquito fitness and on the gut immune system. "
"11","fitness","We identified Asaia spp. as a predominant component of the gut microbiota in the mosquitoes from Nkolondom, representing more than 60% of sequence tags, but these bacteria also were found at lower abundance in all other mosquitoes even in those from the laboratory colony, which is indicative of a positive effect of this bacteria on mosquito fitness. "
"12","fitness","Studies on the association between Burkholderia and the insect midgut revealed mutualistic relationships, where the symbiont presence increases the insect fitness or protects the insect from entomopathogenic fungi [54,55]. "
