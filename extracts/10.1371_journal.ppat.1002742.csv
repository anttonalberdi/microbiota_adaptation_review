"1","wild","A. gambiae mosquitoes collected in natural breeding sites from Cameroon were experimentally challenged with a wild P. falciparum isolate, and their gut bacterial content was submitted for pyrosequencing analysis. "
"2","wild","Interestingly, Cirimotich et al. [24] recently described an Enterobacter bacterium isolated from wild mosquitoes in Zambia that confers refractoriness to P. falciparum infection. "
"3","wild","Here, we challenged wild female mosquitoes with a natural isolate of P. falciparum, thereby offering an opportunity to examine natural bacteria/parasite associations. "
"4","wild","For mosquito NKD97, S2 and S3 primer sets only allowed the identification at the Enterobacteriaceae family level, whereas S1 reached the assignment at the genus level, Serratia. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002742.g001 Anopheles gambiae Midgut Microbiota PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002742 Anopheles gambiae Midgut Microbiota PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002742 microbiota in laboratory-reared mosquitoes as compared with mosquitoes from the wild. "
"5","wild","Proteobacteria represented more than 90% of the bacterial gut content in the mosquitoes from the wild, whereas in laboratoryreared mosquitoes, more than 95% of sequence tags belonged to the Flavobacteria Elizabethkingia spp. "
"6","wild","The drastic loss of microbial diversity from the wild to laboratory conditions may have important consequences on mosquito fitness and on the gut immune system. "
"7","wild","Despite a larger diversity of the gut microbiota in wild mosquitoes, most bacteria species are sparsely distributed between individual mosquitoes. "
"8","wild","This Enterobacter strain was isolated in Zambia from wild-caught A. arabiensis mosquitoes, and differences in the mosquito species, as well as differences between the study areas, may explain why we did not find this bacterium in our material. "
"9","wild","Therefore, it would be of interest to examine the presence/abundance of Esp_Z in wild-caught Zambian A. arabiensis using the methodologies described here. "
"10","fitness","The drastic loss of microbial diversity from the wild to laboratory conditions may have important consequences on mosquito fitness and on the gut immune system. "
"11","fitness","We identified Asaia spp. as a predominant component of the gut microbiota in the mosquitoes from Nkolondom, representing more than 60% of sequence tags, but these bacteria also were found at lower abundance in all other mosquitoes even in those from the laboratory colony, which is indicative of a positive effect of this bacteria on mosquito fitness. "
"12","fitness","Studies on the association between Burkholderia and the insect midgut revealed mutualistic relationships, where the symbiont presence increases the insect fitness or protects the insect from entomopathogenic fungi [54,55]. "
"13","adaptat","Hooper LV, Macpherson AJ (2010) Immune adaptations that maintain homeostasis with the intestinal microbiota. "
"14","model","This undoubtedly explains the higher prevalence and intensity of P. falciparum infections in laboratory colonies of A. gambiae as compared with field-derived mosquitoes and pinpoints the limitations of using laboratory models to study host-pathogens interactions (Morlais and Cohuet, unpublished). "
"15","model","For the mosquito, as described for the insect model Drosophila [73], gut homeostasis could be maintained through the renewal of the intestinal epithelial layer that can be altered upon bacterial killing or through immune regulation. "
"16","disease","Deciphering microbe-pathogen interactions offers new perspectives to control disease transmission. "
"17","disease","However, the recent deployment of next generation DNA sequencing technologies has provided new opportunities to explore microbial diversity of complex environments [28–31] as well as to further investigate disease susceptibilities and host-bacteria-pathogen interactions [32–34]. "
"18","disease","Because alteration of the microbiota composition has been related to the development of diseases or health disorders, the next challenge is to define members of the microbial community and/or the metabolic interdependencies essential to preserve optimal gut homeostasis [34,63]. "
"19","disease","Pathogens and microbes likely depend on similar mechanisms for interacting with their hosts, and a better knowledge of the mosquitomicrobiota interactions would open new avenues for vector disease control through manipulation of gut microbial communities. "
"20","environment","A number of studies have shown that the mosquito innate immune responses play an important role in controlling the malaria infection and that the strength of parasite clearance is under genetic control, but little is known about the influence of environmental factors on the transmission success. "
"21","environment","This striking relationship highlights the role of natural gut environment in parasite transmission. "
"22","environment","The susceptibility of Anopheles mosquitoes to Plasmodium infection is under genetic control [11–13], but the large variability in oocyst number among closely related mosquitoes indicates that environmental factors also play a role. "
"23","environment","These bacteria were acquired from the aquatic environment during immature stage development [25,26], although vertical transmission (from mother to offspring) also has been documented [14,16,25,27]. "
"24","environment","However, the recent deployment of next generation DNA sequencing technologies has provided new opportunities to explore microbial diversity of complex environments [28–31] as well as to further investigate disease susceptibilities and host-bacteria-pathogen interactions [32–34]. "
"25","environment","Variability in P. falciparum infection levels indicates that parasite transmission is the result of complex interactions between vectors and parasites, which rely on both genetic and environmental factors. "
"26","environment","However, in contrast to genetically encoded factors, the role of environmental factors in parasite transmission has received little attention. "
"27","environment","The first two constrained axes explained around 50% of the total variance in the bacterial community and 100% of the species-environment relationship. "
"28","environment","The unrestricted Monte Carlo permutation test (n = 499) indicated that all environmental variables were significant (Nkolondom variable: F = 10.99, P = 0.002; Mvan: F = 13.26, P = 0.004; Mvan and laboratory variables fit collinearly). "
"29","environment","The first and second constrained axes corresponded to 35% and 7% of the total variance in the bacterial community, respectively, and explained all the cumulative percentage variance of the family-environment relationship. "
"30","environment","Blue arrow: bacterial classes, green arrow: environmental variables. "
"31","environment","The Monte Carlo permutation test was used to test the statistical significance of the relationship between environmental variables and the bacterial classes. "
"32","environment","The ‘‘Flavo’’ (Flavobacteriaceae) segregates with ‘‘labo’’ environmental variable, ‘‘Alpha’’ (Alphabacteriaceae) with the ‘‘NKD’’ environmental variable (P,0.05). "
"33","environment","All other bacterial classes segregate along the second axis, with the ‘‘Mvan’’ environmental variable. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002742.g003 Anopheles gambiae Midgut Microbiota PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002742 environmental variables were significant (Monte Carlo test, Nkolondom: F = 14.02, P = 0.002; collinearity detected with Mvan variables; infection variable F = 3.00, P = 0.042). "
"34","environment","The first axis alone explained 84.1% of the variance of the family environment relationship and was related to the mosquito origin (Mvan and Nkolondom). "
"35","environment","Using pyrosequencing, we explored individual midgut samples from adult female mosquitoes collected at the larval stage in different natural environments, exposed to P. falciparum infection at day 5 after emergence and dissected 8 days after the infectious blood meal. "
"36","environment","The predominance of Elizabethkingia spp. in the midguts of the insectary-reared mosquitoes reflects that the bacterium has found a thriving niche in this environment where competition with other bacterial species is limited. "
"37","environment","The aquatic environment of the larval stages presented striking differences: larvae of the Ngousso strain were grown in clean spring water, whereas the immature stages of field mosquitoes were collected in natural breeding sites, water puddles, and flooded areas rich in biotic and abiotic components. "
"38","environment","Thus, our results indicate that the environmental conditions of the vectors are key determinants in shaping midgut microbiota. "
"39","environment","The great difference in the composition of gut bacteria between laboratory and field-collected mosquitoes as well as between mosquitoes originating from distinct breeding sites shows that most bacteria are commensally acquired from the environment. "
"40","environment","We propose that the acquisition of endobacteria occurred from the aquatic environment, and possibly by vertical transmission routes. "
"41","environment","Several strains of Asaia colonize mosquito populations, including symbiotic and environmental isolates that follow distinct routes of transmission [35]. "
"42","environment","The difference of Asaia abundance in mosquitoes sampled in our two study sites, Nkolondom and Mvan, possibly underlies a genetic heterogeneity of the bacterium in the different environmental settings. "
"43","environment","In the latter case, the Burkholderia symbiont is environmentally acquired by the nymphs [54]. "
"44","environment","Cirimotich et al. [24] recovered the Esp_Z on LB media, and culturing methods can lead to the artificial amplification of a bacterial strain present in minute amounts in an environmental sample. "
"45","environment","We propose that the composition of the gut microbiota may influence parasite transmission, which would explain the difference in infection levels between mosquito populations from diverse environments [9,74]. "
"46","environment","Association between microbiota and environmental variables was assessed using a multivariate ordination test. "
"47","environment","We defined the different taxa present in the data set as ‘‘species variables’’ and the origin of the mosquitoes and the P. falciparum infection status as ‘‘environmental variables’’ for each individual. "
"48","environment","The environmental variables were set as dummy variables (0 or 1 values). "
"49","environment","RDA and associated Monte Carlo permutation tests (n = 499) were used to identify the measured environmental variable that contributed most significantly to the variation in the bacterial community data. "

"79","laboratory","Bacterial richness and diversity seem to be particularly poor in the laboratory mosquitoes. "
"80","laboratory","Bacteroidetes are known as glucose degraders, and the large dominance of Elizabethkingia spp. in laboratory-reared mosquitoes is probably due to the mosquito food source [46]. "
