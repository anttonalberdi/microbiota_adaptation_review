"1","wild","To address this question, we used 16S metagenomics to compare the midgut bacterial microbiome of six laboratory colonies of Aedes aegypti recently derived from wild populations representing the geographical range and genetic diversity of the species. "
"2","wild","To address this question, we used a targeted metagenomics approach to compare the gut microbiome between six recent colonies of Ae. aegypti derived from wild populations representing the geographical range and genetic diversity of the species. "
"3","wild","The six colonies originated from wild populations that represent the geographical range and genetic diversity of the species (Fig. 1) and had Table 1 Aedes aegypti colonies included in this study. "
"4","wild","The six colonies were chosen to maximize their genetic differences based on the geographical distribution of their wild populations of origin. "
"5","wild","It is likely that founder effects and adaptation to laboratory conditions modified the genetic composition of the colonies relative to their wild populations of origin. "
"6","wild","Deep sequencing reveals extensive variation in the gut microbiota of wild mosquitoes from Kenya. "
"7","adaptation","It is likely that founder effects and adaptation to laboratory conditions modified the genetic composition of the colonies relative to their wild populations of origin. "
"8","model","In SHAMAN, a generalized linear model (GLM) was fitted and vectors of contrasts were defined to determine the significance in abundance variation between sample types. "
