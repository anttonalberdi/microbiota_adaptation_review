"1","wild","Strikingly, CD8mediated and CD4-mediated GVHD were similar whether host APCs were wild-type or deficient in MyD88, TRIF, or MyD88 and TRIF, which excludes essential roles for TLRs and IL-1b, the key product of inflammasome activation. "
"2","wild","Consistent with this, in an MHC-mismatched allogenic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) model, infusing wild-type (wt) recipient splenic or plasmacytoid DCs can partially restore GVHD to mice with MHC-deficient hematopoietic cells (3, 4). "
"3","wild","Abbreviations used in this paper: alloBMT, allogenic bone marrow transplantation; alloSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; BM, bone marrow; BMT, bone marrow transplantation; DC, dendritic cell; DKO, double knockout; GVHD, graft-versus-host disease; LN, lymph node; MHC-II, MHC class II; miHA, minor histocompatibility Ag; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; Treg, regulatory T cell; wt, wild-type. "
"4","model","To investigate APC activation in GVHD, we used recipient mice with hematopoietic cells genetically deficient in pathways critical for APC maturation in models in which host APCs are absolutely required. "
"5","model","Consistent with this, in an MHC-mismatched allogenic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) model, infusing wild-type (wt) recipient splenic or plasmacytoid DCs can partially restore GVHD to mice with MHC-deficient hematopoietic cells (3, 4). "
"6","model","Such a model would predict that without functional receptors for detecting these bacteria, GVHD would be ameliorated, as is the case for responses against bacteria themselves. "
"7","model","In this study,we report our findings from a comprehensivegenetic approach to assessing these modes of immune recognition using recipient mice with APCs genetically deficient in subsets of the aforementioned pathways in GVHDmodels in which host APCs are absolutely required (2, 8). "
"8","model","Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that GVHD is fundamentally different from most antipathogen responses, tend to counter the prevailing models for GVHD initiation (15), and have implications for strategies to prevent GVHD in the clinic. "
"9","model","In the B6bm12→B6 model, GVHD was induced by splenocytes containing 106 CD4 cells or sorted naive CD4 cells as specified in the text. "
"10","model","We used the C3H.SW (H-2b)→B10 (H-2b) CD8-mediated GVHD model in which host APCs are absolutely required for GVHD. "
"11","model","GVHD in CD402/2 mice We also determined whether host CD40 contributed to GVHD in the C3H.SW→B6 model. "
"12","model","Thus, in this CD8-dependent GVHD model wherein host APCs are essential, signaling via MyD88 and/or TRIF in host APCs was not required. "
"13","model","We therefore determined whether CD8-mediated GVHD in the C3H.SW→B6 model is reduced in B71/B722/2 or IL-122/2 hosts. "
"14","model","236 PRRs in GVHD by guest on January 21, 2022 http://w w w .jim m unol.org/ D ow nloaded from Discussion In pathogen models, optimal adaptive immune responses require APCs to be activated by pathogen-derived molecules that engage PRRs (12, 13). "
"15","model","We studied both CD4-mediated and CD8-mediated GVHD in an independent model with concordant results. "
"16","model","This was surprising as TLR ligation promotes Th1 polarization of naive CD4 cells in a variety of experimental models (68, 72–74). "
"17","model","Host B71/B72 or IL-12 are not required for CD8-mediated GVHD in the C3H.SW→B6 model. "
"18","model","Stimulation through TLRs has been previously examined in alloBMT models. "
"19","model","Less GVHD was also observed in an MHCmismatched GVHD model when donor BM cells were TLR4 deficient (78). "
"20","model","If radiation-resistant host Tregs modify GVHD in the models we employed (which has not been tested), the absence of TLR stimulation could have diminished their activity thereby augmenting GVHD. "
"21","model","In summary, these studies demonstrate that APC activation pathways that contribute to T cell responses in pathogen models are not required for GVHD induction by host APCs. "
"22","model","TLR9 regulates TLR7and MyD88-dependent autoantibody production and disease in a murine model of lupus. "
"23","model","Toll-like receptor 7 and TLR9 dictate autoantibody specificity and have opposing inflammatory and regulatory roles in a murine model of lupus. "
"24","model","MyD88 is pivotal for the early inflammatory response and subsequent bacterial clearance and survival in a mouse model of Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia. "
"25","model","MyD88-dependent responses involving tolllike receptor 2 are important for protection and clearance of Legionella pneumophila in a mouse model of Legionnaires’ disease. "
"26","model","Cooperative interactions between TLR4 and TLR9 regulate interleukin 23 and 17 production in a murine model of gram negative bacterial pneumonia. "
"27","knockout","Abbreviations used in this paper: alloBMT, allogenic bone marrow transplantation; alloSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; BM, bone marrow; BMT, bone marrow transplantation; DC, dendritic cell; DKO, double knockout; GVHD, graft-versus-host disease; LN, lymph node; MHC-II, MHC class II; miHA, minor histocompatibility Ag; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; Treg, regulatory T cell; wt, wild-type. "
"28","knockout","MyD88/TRIF2/2 (double knockout; DKO) mice were generated by crossing MyD882/2 and LPS2 mice. "
"29","knockout","It would not have been surprising to find organ-specific differences inGVHD in at least someof the knockout recipients. "
"30","knockout","Yet, other than decreased liver GVHD in IFNAR12/2 mice, decreased skin and increased small bowel GVHD in IFNAR12/2→wt recipients, and increased skin disease in B71/ B722/2 mice, we did not detect organ-specific differences in GVHD histopathology between any knockout mice and wt controls. "
"31","knockout","To address this would require crossing the knockouts we employed to RAG2/2 or TCR-deficient backgrounds or breeding them to equivalent knockouts on another background, such as BALB/c, to allow parent→F1 GVHDinducing transplants without conditioning. "
"32","knockout","At a practical level, it will be difficult to study yet further compound “knockout” mice to test for multilayered redundancy. "
