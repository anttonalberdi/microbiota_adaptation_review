"1","wild","Strikingly, CD8mediated and CD4-mediated GVHD were similar whether host APCs were wild-type or deficient in MyD88, TRIF, or MyD88 and TRIF, which excludes essential roles for TLRs and IL-1b, the key product of inflammasome activation. "
"2","wild","Consistent with this, in an MHC-mismatched allogenic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) model, infusing wild-type (wt) recipient splenic or plasmacytoid DCs can partially restore GVHD to mice with MHC-deficient hematopoietic cells (3, 4). "
"3","wild","Abbreviations used in this paper: alloBMT, allogenic bone marrow transplantation; alloSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; BM, bone marrow; BMT, bone marrow transplantation; DC, dendritic cell; DKO, double knockout; GVHD, graft-versus-host disease; LN, lymph node; MHC-II, MHC class II; miHA, minor histocompatibility Ag; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; Treg, regulatory T cell; wt, wild-type.
