"1","wild","The present study evaluated the metabolic outcomes of VSG in Fgf15-deficient (KO) mice. 6to 8-wk-old male wild-type (WT) and KO mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk. "
"2","wild","The research objective of this controlled laboratory experiment was to elucidate whether genetically modified Fgf15 knockout (KO) mice would develop the same metabolic improvements after VSG as their wild-type (WT) littermates. "
"3","wild","A: presurgery body weight dynamics in wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice. "
"4","wild","A: 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining of wild-type (WT)and knockout (KO)derived cholic acid (CA)-treated intestinal organoids. "
"5","wild","Enterohepatic bile acid (BA) circulation in wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). "
"6","wild","Liver triglyceride levels were much lower in both VSG groups compared with their respective Sham controls; n: wild-type (WT) Sham=6, WT VSG=6, knockout (KO) Sham=5, KO VSG=7. "
"7","wild","No inflammation was observed in KO Sham liver sections; therefore, no inflammation score was plotted for same; n: wild-type (WT) Sham=6, WT VSG=6, KO Sham=5, KO VSG=7. "
"8","adaptation","Intestinal adaptation after ileal interposition surgery increases bile acid recycling and protects FGF15 UNCOUPLES BILE ACID PHYSIOLOGY FROM SIGNALING G683 AJP-Gastrointest Liver Physiol  doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00175.2020  www.ajpgi.org Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/ajpgi (005.186.121.128) on January 22, 2022. against obesity-related comorbidities. "
"9","adaptation","The role of gut adaptation in the potent effects of multiple bariatric surgeries on obesity and diabetes. "
"10","model","Bile acid metabolism was not impacted by the Fgf15 deficiency in a murine VSG model, which points to the fact that this molecule is not crucial for its regulation. "
"11","model","We utilized a murine model of VSG in our study, and our data indicate that the bile acid-FXR-Fgf15 axis provides beneficial metabolic outcomes after this complex procedure. "
"12","model","The impact of Fgf15 and FGF19 on bile acid metabolism was comparable in this model. "
"13","model","Considering these differences described in the murine models, and the fact that potentially only FGF19 may be administered in clinical settings, we summarize that our data provide only preliminary insight and that subsequent clinical studies are needed to evaluate the effect of FGF19 on glucose metabolism after VSG. "
"14","model","Consequently, one may speculate that Fgf15 deficiency in a VSG model may contribute toward an unfavorable shift of bacterial taxa in the gut, which would result in undesired metabolic phenotypes. "
"15","model","While it is known that the proportion of tenericutes is significantly reduced in a mouse model of obesity and NAFLD (42), patients with hypercholesterolemia have lower abundance of anaeroplasma and mollicutes (17). "
"16","model","Another limitation of our study was that the experiments were performed in a total body Fgf15-KO mouse model; thus, we could not distinguish which location of Fgf15 expression was responsible for each specific effect that was observed in this study. "
"17","model","Diet1, bile acid diarrhea, and FGF15/19: mouse model and human genetic variants. "
"18","model","Farnesoid X receptor deficiency improves glucose homeostasis in mouse models of obesity. "
"19","knockout","The research objective of this controlled laboratory experiment was to elucidate whether genetically modified Fgf15 knockout (KO) mice would develop the same metabolic improvements after VSG as their wild-type (WT) littermates. "
"20","knockout","A: presurgery body weight dynamics in wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice. "
"21","knockout","A: 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining of wild-type (WT)and knockout (KO)derived cholic acid (CA)-treated intestinal organoids. "
"22","knockout","Fgf21 elevation in the knockout mice post-VSG appeared to be a putative adaptive response to ER stress to prevent liver damage; however, it was not sufficient to provide hepatic protection and avert accumulation of cholesterol, DAGs, and its intermediates in the liver. "
"23","knockout","Enterohepatic bile acid (BA) circulation in wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). "
"24","knockout","Liver triglyceride levels were much lower in both VSG groups compared with their respective Sham controls; n: wild-type (WT) Sham=6, WT VSG=6, knockout (KO) Sham=5, KO VSG=7. "
"25","knockout","Future experiments with intestine-specific Fgf15 knockout mice and TGR5 knockout mice will be important to understand this key observation. "
"26","knockout","In knockout (KO) VSG mice, we observed inflammation foci in liver parenchyma (red arrow). "
