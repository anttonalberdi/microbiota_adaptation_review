"9","adaptat","The role of gut adaptation in the potent effects of multiple bariatric surgeries on obesity and diabetes. "
"10","model","Bile acid metabolism was not impacted by the Fgf15 deficiency in a murine VSG model, which points to the fact that this molecule is not crucial for its regulation. "
"11","model","We utilized a murine model of VSG in our study, and our data indicate that the bile acid-FXR-Fgf15 axis provides beneficial metabolic outcomes after this complex procedure. "
"12","model","The impact of Fgf15 and FGF19 on bile acid metabolism was comparable in this model. "
"13","model","Considering these differences described in the murine models, and the fact that potentially only FGF19 may be administered in clinical settings, we summarize that our data provide only preliminary insight and that subsequent clinical studies are needed to evaluate the effect of FGF19 on glucose metabolism after VSG. "
"14","model","Consequently, one may speculate that Fgf15 deficiency in a VSG model may contribute toward an unfavorable shift of bacterial taxa in the gut, which would result in undesired metabolic phenotypes. "
"15","model","While it is known that the proportion of tenericutes is significantly reduced in a mouse model of obesity and NAFLD (42), patients with hypercholesterolemia have lower abundance of anaeroplasma and mollicutes (17). "
"16","model","Another limitation of our study was that the experiments were performed in a total body Fgf15-KO mouse model; thus, we could not distinguish which location of Fgf15 expression was responsible for each specific effect that was observed in this study. "

"22","knockout","Fgf21 elevation in the knockout mice post-VSG appeared to be a putative adaptive response to ER stress to prevent liver damage; however, it was not sufficient to provide hepatic protection and avert accumulation of cholesterol, DAGs, and its intermediates in the liver. "

"29","disease","In the absence of an intact FGF15 signaling pathway, vertical sleeve gastrectomy results in increased intestinal bile acid levels and hepatolipotoxicity. cholesterol metabolism; glucose tolerance; hepatic lipid metabolomics; liver injury; serum bile acid composition INTRODUCTION The prevalence of obesity in the world had doubled since the 1980s (11), and with that the incidence of its comorbidities including but not limited to type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have also increased exponentially (33).

"41","human","Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in humans and its murine ortholog Fgf15 play a pivotal role in this bile acid-driven enterohepatic signaling. "
"42","human","Murine fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) and its human ortholog fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) are both secreted from the distal small intestine (ileum) in response to FXR activation by bile acids (35). "
"43","human","It has been previously reported that reduced expression of Fgf15 in mice leads to increased gastrointestinal motility and increased luminal bile acid content similar to a human bile acid diarrhea phenotype (34). "
"44","human","It was shown that Fgf15, introduced by adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery, failed to correct hyperglycemia and HbA1c levels and did not improve b-cell mass in diabetic db/dbmice despite its high circulating levels, contrary to its human ortholog FGF19 (59). "
"45","human","While recombinant human FGF19 was able to bind with FGFR1c and FGFR4 in complex with both human and mouse b-Klotho, recombinant murine Fgf15 bound the FGFRs only when combined with mouse b-Klotho. "
