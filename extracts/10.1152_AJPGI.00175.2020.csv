"1","wild","The present study evaluated the metabolic outcomes of VSG in Fgf15-deficient (KO) mice. 6to 8-wk-old male wild-type (WT) and KO mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk. "
"2","wild","The research objective of this controlled laboratory experiment was to elucidate whether genetically modified Fgf15 knockout (KO) mice would develop the same metabolic improvements after VSG as their wild-type (WT) littermates. "
"3","wild","A: presurgery body weight dynamics in wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice. "
"4","wild","A: 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining of wild-type (WT)and knockout (KO)derived cholic acid (CA)-treated intestinal organoids. "
"5","wild","Enterohepatic bile acid (BA) circulation in wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). "
"6","wild","Liver triglyceride levels were much lower in both VSG groups compared with their respective Sham controls; n: wild-type (WT) Sham=6, WT VSG=6, knockout (KO) Sham=5, KO VSG=7. "
"7","wild","No inflammation was observed in KO Sham liver sections; therefore, no inflammation score was plotted for same; n: wild-type (WT) Sham=6, WT VSG=6, KO Sham=5, KO VSG=7. "
