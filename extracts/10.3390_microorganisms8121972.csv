"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","The study applied a novel approach of raising Drosophila melanogaster, from ten wild-derived genetic lines on naturally fermented peaches, preserving genuine microbial conditions. "
"2","wild","However, the microbiota of wild fly populations may differ in the diversity and the abundance of dominant species [24]. "
"3","wild","Bacteria of the Larvae Raised on PR Food Exhibit a Distinct Community Structure Multiple studies were performed to evaluate the gut microbiota composition of lab and wild populations of Drosophila [24,57,60–62]. "
"4","wild","Although most of them consistently report the prevalence of different members of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, or Gammaproteobacteria in lab and wild populations, the relative abundance of the taxa, especially at lower taxonomic levels, often varies between studies [61]. "
"5","wild","However, it is difficult to judge how well the microbial community of our experimental larvae represents the microbial community of wild population, as a variety of factors could influence gut microbiota composition in flies, which certainly complicates comparisons between studies [56,61,64]. "
"6","wild","The wild populations of gut microbiota in Drosophila were shown to vary with collection location and diet [56,60,62,67]. "
"7","wild","In other insects and wild populations of vertebrates, gut microbiota was shown to change even with seasonality [68–71]. "
"8","wild","Systems genomics of metabolic phenotypes in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. "
"9","wild","Evolutionary responses of the life history of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster to two standard methods of laboratory culture. "
"10","wild","Microbial community assembly in wild populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. "
"11","wild","Marked seasonal variation in the wild mouse gut microbiota. "
"12","fitness","In addition, using PCA, we observed that correlational effects microbial abundance (as an example at the family level) produced on measured metabolic (Supplementary Figure S10) and fitness phenotypes (development rate and survival; Supplementary Figure S10) varied between the diets. "
"13","fitness","The correlation coefficients between bacteria abundances and fitness phenotypes clustered for all but PA diets (Supplementary Figure S10). "
"14","adaptation","In addition, the adaptation of Drosophila to the lab environment was connected to increased weight and reduced stress tolerance [53–55]. "
"15","adaptation","Rapid loss of stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster under adaptation to laboratory culture. "
"16","adaptation","Differential adaptation of human gut microbiota to bariatric surgery–induced weight loss. "
