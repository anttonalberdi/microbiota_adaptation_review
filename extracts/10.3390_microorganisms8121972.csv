"1","wild","The study applied a novel approach of raising Drosophila melanogaster, from ten wild-derived genetic lines on naturally fermented peaches, preserving genuine microbial conditions. "
"2","wild","However, the microbiota of wild fly populations may differ in the diversity and the abundance of dominant species [24]. "
"3","wild","Bacteria of the Larvae Raised on PR Food Exhibit a Distinct Community Structure Multiple studies were performed to evaluate the gut microbiota composition of lab and wild populations of Drosophila [24,57,60–62]. "
"4","wild","Although most of them consistently report the prevalence of different members of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, or Gammaproteobacteria in lab and wild populations, the relative abundance of the taxa, especially at lower taxonomic levels, often varies between studies [61]. "
"5","wild","However, it is difficult to judge how well the microbial community of our experimental larvae represents the microbial community of wild population, as a variety of factors could influence gut microbiota composition in flies, which certainly complicates comparisons between studies [56,61,64]. "
"6","wild","The wild populations of gut microbiota in Drosophila were shown to vary with collection location and diet [56,60,62,67]. "
"7","wild","In other insects and wild populations of vertebrates, gut microbiota was shown to change even with seasonality [68–71]. "
"8","wild","Systems genomics of metabolic phenotypes in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. "
"9","wild","Evolutionary responses of the life history of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster to two standard methods of laboratory culture. "
"10","wild","Microbial community assembly in wild populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. "
"11","wild","Marked seasonal variation in the wild mouse gut microbiota. "
"12","fitness","In addition, using PCA, we observed that correlational effects microbial abundance (as an example at the family level) produced on measured metabolic (Supplementary Figure S10) and fitness phenotypes (development rate and survival; Supplementary Figure S10) varied between the diets. "
"13","fitness","The correlation coefficients between bacteria abundances and fitness phenotypes clustered for all but PA diets (Supplementary Figure S10). "
"14","adaptation","In addition, the adaptation of Drosophila to the lab environment was connected to increased weight and reduced stress tolerance [53–55]. "
"15","adaptation","Rapid loss of stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster under adaptation to laboratory culture. "
"16","adaptation","Differential adaptation of human gut microbiota to bariatric surgery–induced weight loss. "
"17","model","Normality tests, data transformations, and statistical models were done with JMP Pro 14.0. "
"18","model","Statistical modeling: In order to evaluate the contribution of each variable and their interactive effect to each phenotypic development, we used standard least squares model with model effects to include diet (D), genotype (G), sterilization treatment (T), and their specific interactive effect: D × G (diet-by-genotype), D × T (diet-by-treatment), G × T (genotype-by-treatment), and D × G × T (diet-by-genotype-by-treatment). "
"19","model","In order to verify that the built model fits the data, a lack of fit test was performed. "
"20","model","If the time period of the experiment (Ro) and/or the variance between the colorimetric assay runs (triglyceride, protein, and glucose) (P) produced a significant effect, these variables were included in the model’s effects, unless their addition caused the model to fail the lack of fit test. "
"21","model","Thus, the models for larvae survival, development time, and weight were the following: yi = β0 + β1D1i + β2G2i + β3T3i + β4(D ∗G)4i + β5(D ∗ T)5i + β6(G ∗ T)6i + β7(D ∗G ∗ T)i7 + εi For triglyceride by weight: yi = β0 + β1D1i + β2G2i + β3T3i + β4(D ∗G)4i + β5(D ∗ T)5i + β6(G ∗ T)6i + β7(D ∗G ∗ T)i7 + β8 P8i + εi Additionally, for protein and glucose by weight: yi = β0 + β1D1i + β2G2i + β3T3i + β4(D ∗G)4i + β5(D ∗ T)5i + β6(G ∗ T)6i + β7(D ∗G ∗ T)i7 + β8 P8i + β9R9i + εi where yi is the response, β values are constants, and εi is a random error term. "
"22","model","All models for interactive effects of diet, genotype, and treatment were done with all 10 genetic lines, with the exception of glucose, which was done without 861 due to the low survival rate of this genetic line. "
"23","model","In order to verify that the built model fits the data, a lack of fit test was performed. "
"24","model","Only the models with non-significant lack of fit p-value were kept. "
"25","model","S), we used the least square model with one main explanatory variable of interest (diet or treatment). "
"26","model","To evaluate the interactive effect of the variables on the abundance of each identified bacterial taxa, we used the three-way linear interaction model. yi = β0 + β1D1i + β2G2i + β3T3i + β4(D ∗G)4i + β5(D ∗ T)5i + β6(G ∗ T)6i + β7(D ∗G ∗ T)i7 + β8R8i + εi In order to identify the correlations between larvae phenotypes and bacterial abundances, we found the mean phenotype for each combination of diet, genetic line, treatment, and round. "
"27","model","Evaluating the Contribution of Tested Independent Variables on Larvae Phenotypes, We Observed a Genetic Variation in Most of the Tested Life History Traits and Phenotypes that Interacted with the Dietary Conditions and the Availability of Maternally Transmitted Microbiota Survival: All of the independent variables included in the model produced a significant effect on larval survival until the late third instar stage. "
"28","model","Protein: In contrast with other measured phenotypes, the variance explained by the model was predominantly evenly distributed across the independent variables, with genotype having the highest predicting power followed by the D × G interactive effect (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1.5). "
"29","model","The challenges of using a mouse model involve relatively high expenses for husbandry and logistics [75–77]. "
"30","model","Drosophila melanogaster is an exceptional model to study the effect of genotype on the phenotype formation, due to the variety of established tools such as Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel and The Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource. "
