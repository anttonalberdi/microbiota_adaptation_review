"
"4","wild","A study of wild mice has also observed an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in helminth-infected individuals (Kreisinger et al., 2015) whereas mice experimentally infected with the small intestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis showed a decrease of Firmicutes while increasing Bacteroidetes (Fricke et al., 2015). "
"5","wild","In contrast, wild mice infected with helminths showed mixed effects with respect to metabolomic shifts (Kreisinger et al., 2015). "
"6","wild","Notably, wild mice with H. p. bakeri appeared to have an increased capacity to metabolize carbohydrates; however, metabolites were not measured and mouse weights were not reported. "
"7","wild","C. elegans nematodes isolated from the wild are observed to harbor live bacteria in their intestine which may exist as commensals or which may proliferate and cause obstruction and pathology of the worm gut (Félix and Duveau, 2012). "
"8","wild","Worms isolated from the wild also carry a distinct and diverse microbiota when compared to other nematode species in the same environment (Dirksen et al., 2016). "
"9","wild","In the same study, a subset of 14 bacterial isolates were chosen in order to cultivate nematodes on an experimental microbiota with bacterial frequencies mirroring the nematodeassociated microbiota of worms isolated from the wild. "
"10","wild","The digested remains of yeasts can be found in the intestines of C. elegans isolated from the wild, demonstrating the capability of these nematodes to use eukaryotic cells as a food source in addition to bacteria (Félix and Duveau, 2012). "
"11","wild","In addition to clec-50, clec-49 is also upregulated in response to S. marcescens (Engelmann et al., 2011) and mutants deficient in this protein and another CTL, clec39, have increased susceptibility to, and reduced survival and fecundity during, S. marcescens infection compared to wild-type worms (Miltsch et al., 2014). "
"12","wild","A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type. "
"13","wild","Interactions between multiple helminths and the gut microbiota in wild rodents. "
"14","wild","The gut microbiota of wild mice. "
"15","fitness","This bacterial strain may be a prominent symbiont for C. elegans as it seems to use the nematode as an environmental niche in the absence of apparent fitness costs to the worm. "
