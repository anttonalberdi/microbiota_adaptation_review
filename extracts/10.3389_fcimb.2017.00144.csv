"55","environment","This review will summarize current knowledge regarding how parasitic nematodes and their microbial environments may influence each other, supplemented with insights from work in C. elegans. "
"56","environment","Trichurids inhabit the most dense and diverse microbial environments of their hosts: the cecum and colon (Klementowicz et al., 2012). "
"57","environment","Additionally, worms can be found in states of starvation or constipation in their natural environments (Barrière and Félix, 2005). "
"58","environment","Many studies have now shown that intestinal nematodes influence their microbial niches as they establish themselves as part of their wider environment within the host; therefore, the role of helminths in dysbiosis is an area of active investigation (Figure 1). "
"59","environment","In contrast, proliferating populations of nematodes can be found in microbe-dense environments, particularly rotting fruits or vegetation. "
"60","environment","A study by Samuel et al. characterized the natural bacterial microenvironment of C. elegans (Samuel et al., 2016). "

"62","environment","Experiments assessing the effect of C. elegans on an experimental microbiota could be designed, whereby the nematodes are introduced into a defined microbial environment and followed over time to assess changes to bacterial constituents. "
"63","environment","In addition to influencing the rich and diverse microbial environments that they inhabit, nematodes inevitably also harbor their own microbiota that is likely essential for normal development and physiology, as is the case for other organisms. "
"64","environment","The authors reported retrieval of one hookworm which also revealed two colonies of bacteria whichwere notV. cholerae.The authors reasoned that pathogenic bacteria may survive inside parasites when parasites are passed in the stool, as happens commonly during a cholera infection, thereby contributing to environmental spread of microbial pathogens. "
"65","environment","Taken together, these findings highlight the clinical relevance of understanding interactions between intestinal nematodes and environmental microbes. "
"66","environment","As H. p. bakeri hatch outside of the host, they likely enter their hosts with a distinct microbiota which changes over time in the new environment. "

"68","environment","This bacterial strain may be a prominent symbiont for C. elegans as it seems to use the nematode as an environmental niche in the absence of apparent fitness costs to the worm. "
"69","environment","Beneficial effects of microbes on nematodes may include nutrition, promotion of longevity, protection from infection by other microbes, and contributions to a hospitable environment (Cabreiro and Gems, 2013; MacNeil and Walhout, 2013). "
"70","environment","From the perspective of mammalian hosts, the question arises whether a specific microbial environment might significantly influence susceptibility to helminth infection. "
"71","environment","The microbial environment can profoundly impact establishment and propagation of parasitic nematode infections by influencing egg hatching and reproductive success. "
"72","environment","Similar to T. muris infections discussed above, studies in germfree mice revealed higher H. p. bakeri worm burdens in conventionally raised mice, implicating the host microbiota as a key part of the parasite’s environmental niche (Wescott, 1968). "
"73","environment","Bacterial populations also influence the host’s immune status which can have a profound influence on the intestinal environment for parasite establishment, though Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2017 | Volume 7 | Article 144 Midha et al.

"74","environment","SENSING THE MICROBIAL ENVIRONMENT Nematodes are confronted with a tremendous and highly diverse microbial environment, presenting many infectious challenges. "
"75","environment","Alterations in the intestinal microbiota during helminth infection, coupled with studies demonstrating distinctly beneficial or harmful outcomes to C. elegans physiology in response to various bacteria, illustrate the ability of nematodes to sense their microbial environments and possibly discriminate between microbial species. "
"76","environment","Consequently, sensing of the microbial environment might follow conserved or comparable mechanisms in parasitic nematodes as well. "
"77","environment","Microbial infection can often lead to mitochondrial stress; a survey of C. elegans responses to bacteria isolated from the nematode’s natural environment found that 101 strains of the >550 isolates tested induced the mitochondrial stress reporter promoter hsp-6::GFP (Samuel et al., 2016). "
"78","environment","Interestingly, the free-living soil bacteria B. megaterium and M. luteus are both frequently found with Rhabditid nematodes (Coolon et al., 2009) and may be present in the environment of C. elegans. "
