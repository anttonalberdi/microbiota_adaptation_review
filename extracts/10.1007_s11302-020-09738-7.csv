"1","wild","To determine the potential role of P2rx7 under metabolic and thermogenic stress conditions, we performed comparative studies using male P2rx7 knockout (KO) and respective wild-type controls on both BALB/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds. "
"2","wild","Compared with the wild-type allele 451P, the 451L allele is reported to have lower sensitivity to ATP in T cells [20]. "
"3","wild","We used agematched male BALB/c and C57BL/6J wild-type mice and P2rx7 KO mice. "
"4","wild","High-fat diet experiments in BALB/c and C57BL/6J wild-type and P2rx7KO mice were performed by feeding 6-week-old male mice a high-fat diet (20% protein, 35.6% fat, 0.3% fiber, 23.2% sugar, from ssniff Spezialitäten GmbH, Germany) for 16 weeks in a humidity-controlled climate chamber at thermoneutral (30 °C) or room temperature (22 °C) conditions. "
"5","wild","In order to determine thermogenic capacity in P2rx7 KO and wild-type mice, the temperature was gradually decreased by 4–5 °C (from 3 to 6 °C) at 7 a.m. each day. "
"6","wild","C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice were fed a normal chow (lean) or a diabetogenic high-fat diet for 16 weeks to generate lean or dietinduced obese (DIO) mice. "
"7","wild","Protein expression analyses of interscapular BAT and inguinal and gonadal WAT from wild-type and P2xr7 KO male mice that were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks showed the presence of P2X7 in all adipose tissue depots in both strains (Fig. 3a). "
"8","wild","However, no significant differences were observed between wild-type and P2rx7KOmale mice on the BALB/c background regarding O2 consumption, CO2 consumption, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER; Fig. 3b–d). "
"9","wild","Also, other metabolic parameters including food and water intake, and locomotor activity showed no significant differences between wild-type and P2rx7 KO mice in both mouse strains studied (Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). "
"10","wild","Effect of P2X7 deficiency on adiposity & In order to determine the effect of P2X7 deficiency on adiposity, we subjected P2rx7 KO and wild-type control male mice on the BALB/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds to a HFD feeding regimen. "
"11","wild","Consistently, we observed a modest reduction in macrophage infiltration in gonadal and inguinal WAT of P2rx7 KO compared with wild-type control mice by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against the macrophage marker Galectin-3 (Mac-2) (Fig. 5e, f). "
"12","wild","Compared with wild-type mice, we found reduced gene expression of Tnf and Ccl2 in liver of P2rx7KO BALB/c mice (Fig. 7e). "
"13","adaptat","The aim of this study was to determine the expression of purinergic receptors (P2rx4, P2rx5, P2rx7) in adipose tissue of obese mice and in isolated adipocytes, endothelial cells, and tissue-resident macrophages of adipose tissue under normal and cold adaptation housing condition. "
"14","adaptat","After adaptation to thermoneutral conditions (30 °C), we measured energy expenditure during the gradual decrease of the ambient temperature (5–6 °C each day) to 6 °C (Fig. 3b–g). "
"15","adaptat","Taken together, these results indicate a minor role for P2X7 in regulating energy expenditure during cold adaptation. "
"16","adaptat","Probably, also aging-relatedmetabolic adaptationmay play a role in manifesting metabolic dysfunctional processes. "
