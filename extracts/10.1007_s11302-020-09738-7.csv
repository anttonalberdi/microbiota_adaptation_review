"1","wild","To determine the potential role of P2rx7 under metabolic and thermogenic stress conditions, we performed comparative studies using male P2rx7 knockout (KO) and respective wild-type controls on both BALB/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds. "
"2","wild","Compared with the wild-type allele 451P, the 451L allele is reported to have lower sensitivity to ATP in T cells [20]. "
"3","wild","We used agematched male BALB/c and C57BL/6J wild-type mice and P2rx7 KO mice. "
"4","wild","High-fat diet experiments in BALB/c and C57BL/6J wild-type and P2rx7KO mice were performed by feeding 6-week-old male mice a high-fat diet (20% protein, 35.6% fat, 0.3% fiber, 23.2% sugar, from ssniff Spezialitäten GmbH, Germany) for 16 weeks in a humidity-controlled climate chamber at thermoneutral (30 °C) or room temperature (22 °C) conditions. "
"5","wild","In order to determine thermogenic capacity in P2rx7 KO and wild-type mice, the temperature was gradually decreased by 4–5 °C (from 3 to 6 °C) at 7 a.m. each day. "
"6","wild","C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice were fed a normal chow (lean) or a diabetogenic high-fat diet for 16 weeks to generate lean or dietinduced obese (DIO) mice. "
"7","wild","Protein expression analyses of interscapular BAT and inguinal and gonadal WAT from wild-type and P2xr7 KO male mice that were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks showed the presence of P2X7 in all adipose tissue depots in both strains (Fig. 3a). "
"8","wild","However, no significant differences were observed between wild-type and P2rx7KOmale mice on the BALB/c background regarding O2 consumption, CO2 consumption, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER; Fig. 3b–d). "
"9","wild","Also, other metabolic parameters including food and water intake, and locomotor activity showed no significant differences between wild-type and P2rx7 KO mice in both mouse strains studied (Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). "
"10","wild","Effect of P2X7 deficiency on adiposity & In order to determine the effect of P2X7 deficiency on adiposity, we subjected P2rx7 KO and wild-type control male mice on the BALB/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds to a HFD feeding regimen. "
"11","wild","Consistently, we observed a modest reduction in macrophage infiltration in gonadal and inguinal WAT of P2rx7 KO compared with wild-type control mice by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against the macrophage marker Galectin-3 (Mac-2) (Fig. 5e, f). "
"12","wild","Compared with wild-type mice, we found reduced gene expression of Tnf and Ccl2 in liver of P2rx7KO BALB/c mice (Fig. 7e). "
"13","adaptation","The aim of this study was to determine the expression of purinergic receptors (P2rx4, P2rx5, P2rx7) in adipose tissue of obese mice and in isolated adipocytes, endothelial cells, and tissue-resident macrophages of adipose tissue under normal and cold adaptation housing condition. "
"14","adaptation","After adaptation to thermoneutral conditions (30 °C), we measured energy expenditure during the gradual decrease of the ambient temperature (5–6 °C each day) to 6 °C (Fig. 3b–g). "
"15","adaptation","Taken together, these results indicate a minor role for P2X7 in regulating energy expenditure during cold adaptation. "
"16","adaptation","Probably, also aging-relatedmetabolic adaptationmay play a role in manifesting metabolic dysfunctional processes. "

"18","model","In line, we detected increased expression of Emr1 in WAT of both dietary (dietinduced obesity: DIO) and genetic (ob/ob) models of obesity (Fig. 1a). "
"19","model","Cold exposure leads to a catabolic condition to promote energy combustion and heat production, which is associated with tissue remodeling of WAT and BAT [2, 28]. "
"20","model","Taken together, these data support the notion that purinergic P2X receptors could play a role in WAT and BAT remodeling in response to dietary or cold stress. "

"24","model","Here we show that both nutritional stress and genetic model of obesity result in increased expression of P2X7 which is associated with increased macrophage infiltration within adipose tissue and also increased expression of CD39 and CD73. "
"25","model","We sought to ascertain the role of P2X7 in the diet-induced obese mouse model. "
"26","model","Taken together, these data suggest that P2rx7 may play only a minor role if any in insulin resistance caused by overnutrition in mouse models. "
