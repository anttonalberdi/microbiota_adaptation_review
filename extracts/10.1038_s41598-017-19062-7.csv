"1","wild","After monoassociation, EcN was detected in spleens and livers of TLR4−/− and CD14−/− but not wildtype mice. "
"2","wild","In contrast to wildtype (WT) mice, EcN monoassociation resulted in increased bacterial invasion in TLR4−/− mice to liver and spleen 3 days after inoculation (Fig. 1a). "

"4","model","In animal models of experimental colitis Cd14 has been identified as a promising candidate gene21, which plays a protective role in experimental IBD18,22. "
"5","model","Therefore, in the present study EcN monoassociation was utilized in a CD14−/− mouse model to reveal alterations of the intestinal mucosa and the influence of CD14 on the intestinal homeostasis. "
"6","model","Thus, increased cell death and reduced EJ expression point towards epithelial barrier impairment in this model. "
"7","model","Together these findings indicate the importance of the hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell compartment to reduce bacterial invasion and maintain the intestinal barrier in this model. "
"8","model","Values are shown as fold induction (n = 5). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 7Scientific RepoRts | (2018) 8:719 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-19062-7 The level of EcN colonization was comparable among these two models (Supplementary Fig. 1d). "
"9","model","Activation of the TLR2 pathway has been shown to strengthen the intestinal barrier by enhancing the TJ formation41,42, e.g. in a Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis model43. "
"10","model","Neither the hematopoietic nor the non-hematopoietic cell compartment could completely prevent bacterial translocation in this model. "
"11","model","Therefore, B cell function was further assessed in this model. "
"12","model","To provide evidence regarding the protective role of B cells in this model, the CD20 antibody was utilized to deplete B cells in WT mice. "
"13","model","Additionally, WT recipients of CD14−/− BM did not show dysregulated EJ expression, strengthening the hypothesis of a CD14-dependent communication pathway between B cells and epithelial cells, likely involving the soluble form. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 1 0Scientific RepoRts | (2018) 8:719 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-19062-7 To further support the role of B cells in this model, GF CXCR5−/− and CCR7−/− mice were colonized with EcN. "
"14","model","It is intriguing to speculate that innate-like immune cells (B-1 and marginal zone B cells) contribute to the maintenance of the intestinal homeostasis in this model. "
"15","disease","This delicate system can be disrupted by bacterial imbalance, defects in the epithelial barrier or/and immune regulation mechanisms and subsequently lead to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)12–14. "
"16","disease","IBD, with the two main forms Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic multifactorial gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder. "
