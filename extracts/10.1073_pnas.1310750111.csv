"1","wild","Supplementation of wild-type animals with L. johnsonii protected them against both airway allergen challenge or infection with respiratory syncytial virus. "
"2","wild","(2009) Selective progressive response of soil microbial community to wild oat roots. "
"3","model","Here, we demonstrate, using murine models, that exposure of mice to dog-associated house dust protects against ovalbumin or cockroach allergen-mediated airway pathology. "
"4","model","S2A] were used in a CRA airway challenge model described in SI Materials and Methods. "
"5","model","To determine whether the alteration of pulmonary immunity in D dust-exposed animals extended to other allergens, we used an antigen-specific ovalbumin (OVA) murine model that involves transfer of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)stained splenic na√Øve T cells from DO.11 OVA protein-specific animals before airway OVA challenge (detailed in SI Materials and Methods; Fig. "
"6","model","Hence, to determine as proof of principle whether this member of the protective microbiome played a role in modulating adaptive immune responses associated with airway protection, we generated standardized supplements of this species that were used to gavage animals in a similar experimental design as the CRA airway challenge model. "
"7","model","To further examine whether this protective effect was more generalized, we used a primary viral infection model. "
"8","model","Similar to observations made in the allergen model, a significant reduction in draining lymph node T-cell production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17 was also observed in only the live L. johnsonii-supplemented animals (Fig. "
"9","model","To determine whether supplementation of animals with L. johnsonii impacted the microbiome, cecal contents of animals in each treatment group from the CRA challenge model were subjected to microbiome profiling. "
"10","model","The change in the immune environment observed in these studies may be due directly to the specific supplemented bacterial species, the ancillary species that are enriched because of the presence of the supplemented species, or the depletion of organisms outcompeted in this remodeled assemblage, that differentially program host immune responses. "
"11","model","Although the fundamental mechanisms that govern this phenomenon remain unclear, the studies reported here provide proof-of-principle that differential environmental exposures result in GI microbiome remodeling that impacts host immune responses associated with both allergic airway response and respiratory viral infection.
