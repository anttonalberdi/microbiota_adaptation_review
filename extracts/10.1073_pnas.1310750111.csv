"1","wild","Supplementation of wild-type animals with L. johnsonii protected them against both airway allergen challenge or infection with respiratory syncytial virus. "

"3","model","Here, we demonstrate, using murine models, that exposure of mice to dog-associated house dust protects against ovalbumin or cockroach allergen-mediated airway pathology. "
"4","model","S2A] were used in a CRA airway challenge model described in SI Materials and Methods. "
"5","model","To determine whether the alteration of pulmonary immunity in D dust-exposed animals extended to other allergens, we used an antigen-specific ovalbumin (OVA) murine model that involves transfer of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)stained splenic naïve T cells from DO.11 OVA protein-specific animals before airway OVA challenge (detailed in SI Materials and Methods; Fig. "
"6","model","Hence, to determine as proof of principle whether this member of the protective microbiome played a role in modulating adaptive immune responses associated with airway protection, we generated standardized supplements of this species that were used to gavage animals in a similar experimental design as the CRA airway challenge model. "
"7","model","To further examine whether this protective effect was more generalized, we used a primary viral infection model. "
"8","model","Similar to observations made in the allergen model, a significant reduction in draining lymph node T-cell production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17 was also observed in only the live L. johnsonii-supplemented animals (Fig. "
"9","model","To determine whether supplementation of animals with L. johnsonii impacted the microbiome, cecal contents of animals in each treatment group from the CRA challenge model were subjected to microbiome profiling. "
"10","model","The change in the immune environment observed in these studies may be due directly to the specific supplemented bacterial species, the ancillary species that are enriched because of the presence of the supplemented species, or the depletion of organisms outcompeted in this remodeled assemblage, that differentially program host immune responses. "
"11","model","Although the fundamental mechanisms that govern this phenomenon remain unclear, the studies reported here provide proof-of-principle that differential environmental exposures result in GI microbiome remodeling that impacts host immune responses associated with both allergic airway response and respiratory viral infection.

"12","disease","Isberg, Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, and approved November 19, 2013 (received for review June 6, 2013) Exposure to dogs in early infancy has been shown to reduce the risk of childhood allergic disease development, and dog ownership is associated with a distinct house dust microbial exposure. "
"13","disease","A large European birth cohort study demonstrated that a significant increase in the number of Escherichia coli or Clostridium difficile in fecal samples from 3-wk-old infants was associated with a greater risk of developing a spectrum of childhood allergic diseases (7), commonly characterized by overactive Th2 adaptive immune response. "
"14","disease","Conversely, exposure to livestock or pets, particularly dogs during this early-life period, significantly decreases the risk for disease development (10, 11). "
"15","disease","Because GI microbiome composition clearly impacts immune function, and early GI colonization patterns are linked to allergic disease development, it is necessary to understand whether and how distinct environmental microbial exposures associated with allergy-protective factors influence GI microbiome composition and airway disease outcomes. "
"16","disease","DNA extraction of 0.1 g of Significance Early-life exposure to dogs is protective against allergic disease development, and dog ownership is associated with a distinct milieu of house dust microbial exposures. "
"17","disease","This study supports the possibility that host–environment interactions that govern allergic or infectious airway disease may be mediated, at least in part, by the impact of environmental exposures on the gastrointestinal microbiome composition and, by extension, its impact on the host immune response. "
"18","disease","Exposure of animals to dust from homes with dogs attenuates the development of allergen-induced airways disease and serum IgE. "
"19","disease","Supplementation of mice with L. johnsonii attenuates the development of allergic airways disease. "
"20","disease","In Western nations, the burden of chronic inflammatory disease, including allergic asthma, have increased dramatically over the past several decades and humans spend ∼92% of their time indoors (22), therefore a large portion of environmental microbial exposure originates from the household living environment. "
"21","disease","Hence this study was devised to test the hypothesis that distinct indoor microbial exposures impact allergic airway disease outcomes in mice and that outcome is predicated on GI microbiome composition. "
"22","disease","These studies suggest that GI microbiome manipulation represents a promising and efficacious therapeutic strategy to protect individuals against both pulmonary infection and allergic airway disease. "
"23","disease","(2012) Differences in faecal bacteria populations and faecal bacteria metabolism in healthy adults and celiac disease patients. "
"24","environment","Moreover, the study identifies L. johnsonii as a pivotal species within the gastrointestinal tract capable of influencing adaptive immunity at remote mucosal surfaces in a manner that is protective against a variety of respiratory insults. house environment | airway adaptive immunity | gastrointestinal bacterial community | Lactobacilliaceae The emerging field of human microbiome research has dem-onstrated the key role microbial communities play in a variety of critical mammalian processes including ancillary mucosal barrier function (1) and metabolism (2, 3), as well as development and modulation of host immune responses (4, 5). "
"25","environment","These studies demonstrate that despite the complexity of the GI microbiome, the presence or absence of specific bacterial species can dramatically alter the adaptive immune environment. "
"26","environment","Conceivably, the mechanism by which animal exposures mediate their protective effect is through their impact on local environmental microbial exposures, which in turn influence microbiome membership and the immune response of the human host. "

"30","environment","(E) Serum IgE levels reflected the reduction in the development of the Th2 environment in the D dust-supplemented animals. "
"31","environment","Discussion Humans are constantly exposed to environmental microbes, a salient point given recent microbiome studies that have underscored the reliance of mammalian systems on appropriate microbial colonization to support metabolic and immune homeostasis. "
"32","environment","In Western nations, the burden of chronic inflammatory disease, including allergic asthma, have increased dramatically over the past several decades and humans spend ∼92% of their time indoors (22), therefore a large portion of environmental microbial exposure originates from the household living environment. "
"33","environment","The importance of the GI microbiome in defining both the local and systemic immune environment has been demonstrated in a number of recent studies, indicating that strategies to manipulate gut microbiome membership and function may have farreaching implications for extraintestinal niches, such as the skin or joints (23). "
"34","environment","Multiple phylogenetically distinct species significantly enriched in these animals were not enriched in L. johnsonii-supplemented animals, implicating these species in enhanced airway protection, and indicating that GI species that contribute to airway protection originate from environmental sources.
