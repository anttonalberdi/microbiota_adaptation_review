"1","wild","Akita and wild-type (C57BL/6J) male mice, 24 to 26 weeks old, were treated with or without a selective inhibitor of NF-kB, 4-methyl-N1-(3-phenyl-propyl) benzene-1,2-diamine (JSH-23), for 4 weeks. "
"2","wild","Electroretinogram demonstrated that Aand B-waves in Akita were significantly smaller than in wild type mice, indicating that JSH-23 intervention prevented loss of retinal function. "
"3","wild","To maintain a consistent background, wildtype (WT) littermate male mice that lack the Ins2Akita mutation were used as control. "
"4","wild","A: Genotyping of Akita (AK) and wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) mice. "
"5","wild","A: There is no change in the systemic blood pressure in wild-type (WT) and Akita mice before and after treatment with JSH-23. "
"6","wild","A: Fluorescein angiography (FA) in wild-type (WT) and Akita mice treated with JSH-23 compared with untreated mice. "
"7","wild","The A-wave amplitude in the retinae of Akita mice decreased (P < 0.0001; n Z 6 per group); however, the treatment with JSH-23 prevented a decrease in the A-wave amplitude in Akita mice (P < 0.0001)Figure 4 A: Electroretinograms (ERGs) of wild-type (WT) and Akita (AK) mice tr when superimposed on top of each other mark the relative differences in amplitude and WT mice with or without JSH-23 n Z 6 (B and C).

"9","wild","JSH-23 treatment decreased the expression of both casp1 (P < 0.0001; nZ 6 per group) and IL-1B (P < 0.0001; nZ 6 per group) (Figure 9, D and E).ajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Figure 6 A: Western blotting depicting protein levels of key inflammatory molecules in wild-type (WT) and Akita (AK) mice treated with JSH-23 (J).
