"1","wild","Akita and wild-type (C57BL/6J) male mice, 24 to 26 weeks old, were treated with or without a selective inhibitor of NF-kB, 4-methyl-N1-(3-phenyl-propyl) benzene-1,2-diamine (JSH-23), for 4 weeks. "

"
"18","model","It also mitigated vascular remodeling and microaneurysms significantly. "
"19","model","Recently, 4-methyl-N1-(3-phenyl-propyl) benzene-1,2-diamine (known as JSH-23) was used to inhibit the nuclear translocation of the p65/p50 heterodimer.16 JSH-23 inhibits translocation of NF-kB in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharides.14,17 JSH-23 is cell permeable and is also effective in mitigating microvascular complications (eg, neuropathy).13,14 This study aimed to determine the role of inflammation in remodeling of retinal structure and function in the Akita mouse strain and investigate whether JSH-23 can protect the diabetic retina. "
"20","model","It is characterized as a T1D model because of its fertility, stable insulin-deficient diabetes, and no systemic immune modulation.23 Akita harbors a missense mutation in the insulin 2 gene, leading to a conformational change in the insulin protein, causing its accumulation in the pancreatic b cells. "
"21","model","Overall, JSH-23 alleviated retinovascular remodeling, including permeability, indicating that inhibition of inflammation via NF-kB helps protect the diabetic retina.23,25e27,57e62 Activation of NF-kB and its subsequent nuclear translocation can be separated from other biological processes, thus allowing an opportunity to test its targeting, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. "
"22","model","The current study used a T1D model that shows degenerative changes in the955 Figure 7 Immunoblotting of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 proteins. "
"23","model","Chi et al66 showed that JSH-23 injected into the vitreous inhibited phosphorylated NF-kB p65 and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a glaucoma mouse model. "
"24","model","The structural and physiological alterations in the retinal vasculature result in a corresponding decrease in the contents responsible for retinovascular junction integrity, encompassing junctional molecules (connexin-43 and occludin), leading to retinal remodeling. "
"25","model","This study showed that inhibition of NF-kB significantly diminished cell-junctional molecule degradation in the retinae of Akita mice, thereby decreasing vascular permeability and retinal remodeling (Figure 12). "
"26","model","It is notable that JSH-23 treatment has been shown to abate the inflammatory response to injuryajp.amjpathol.org The American Journal of Pathology Treating Diabetes via NF-kB Inhibitionin other model systems.103 It is also worth mentioning that various types of both steroidal and nonsteroidal (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) agents have been demonstrated to inhibit NF-kB, but their actions are highly pleiotropic.104,105 Therefore, one of the major challenges facing scientists is to develop NF-kB inhibitor(s) aimed at treating different diseases based on their ability to target specific pathway(s) in specific disease condition(s) such as DR, with small molecules like JSH-23, thereby avoiding the risk of undesired clinical adverse effects.
