"1","wild","Reactivation of TNFRI on intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased intestinal permeability and liver disease that is similar to wild type mice after alcohol feeding, suggesting that enteric TNFRI promotes intestinal barrier dysfunction. "
"2","wild","Levels of LPS in the portal vein of mice with a non-functional TLR4 expression are similar to wild type mice, indicating that TLR4 does not control intestinal permeability and that protection from disease occurs at the level of the liver. "
"3","wild","C57BL/6 wild type mice were bred in the same room of our vivarium and used as controls for experiments involving TNFRIflxneo/flxneo and VillinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice. "
"4","wild","Heterozygous long MLCK-/mice17 were crossed, and wild type and knockout littermates were used for all experiments. "
"5","wild","TNFRI mutant (TNFRIflxneo/flxneo) mice were protected from an increase in intestinal permeability following alcohol feeding for 8 weeks compared with wild type mice as measured by fecal albumin. "
"6","wild","Levels of fecal albumin were significantly higher in mice with a selective reactivation of TNFRI on intestinal epithelial cells (VillinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo) as compared with TNFRI mutant (TNFRIflxneo/flxneo), but similar to C57BL/6 wild type mice (Fig. "
"7","wild","Coli proteins as compared with wild type mice. "
"8","wild","5A, B) and decreased hepatic triglyceride contents after alcohol feeding compared with wild type mice (Fig. "
"9","wild","5C, D) than TNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice, but comparable with wild type mice after chronic alcohol feeding. "
"10","wild","There is no significant difference in alcohol-induced liver injury and hepatic steatosis between VillinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo and wild type mice. "
"11","wild","Jejunal epithelial cells isolated from wild type mice that were administered alcohol by oral gavage once showed higher levels of phosphorylated MLCK (long isoform) than wild type mice gavaged with dextrose as control. "
"12","wild","Reactivation of TNFRI selectively on intestinal epithelial cells restored MLCK phosphorylation to a level similar to that of wild type mice after alcohol administration (Fig. "
"13","wild","However, MLCK phosphorylation is comparable between wild type and TNFR2 deficient enterocytes after ethanol administration (Suppl. "
"14","wild","To dissect the functional role of MLCK in increasing intestinal permeability following chronic alcohol feeding, MLCK deficient and wild type littermate mice were subjected to the Lieber-DeCarli alcohol feeding model for 8 weeks. "
"15","wild","Alcohol feeding increased intestinal permeability in wild type mice as compared with isocaloric diet fed wild type mice. "
"16","wild","Intestinal permeability is significantly lower in MLCK-/than wild type mice following alcohol administration. "
"17","wild","Coli proteins in the liver but significant lower LPS plasma level as compared with wild type littermates after alcohol feeding (Fig. "
"18","wild","Expression of occludin protein was diminished in the jejunum of alcohol-fed wild type mice, but not of alcohol-fed MLCK-/mice (Fig. "
"19","wild","Administration of ethanol lead to an increase of liver weight to body weight ratio in wild type, but not MLCK-/mice (Suppl. "
"20","wild","Plasma ALT levels as measures for liver injury were reduced in alcohol-fed MLCK-/mice compared with wild type littermates, but there was no significant difference (Fig. "
"21","wild","Hepatic chemokine expression such as Ccl2 (also known as MCP-1) and Ccl3 (MIP-1Î±) was increased after ethanol treatment in wild type mice but showed comparable level between alcohol fed wild type and MLCK-/mice (Suppl. "
"22","wild","Hepatic fat accumulation was significantly lower in MLCK deficient mice as compared with wild type mice following 8 weeks of ethanol feeding (Fig. "
"23","wild","However, reactivation of TNFRI specifically on enterocytes increased liver fibrosis as compared with TNFRI mutant mice, but the degree of fibrosis is still lower compared with wild type mice16 suggesting that liver TNFRI (e.g. on hepatic stellate cells and/or Kupffer cells) might account for differences in the fibrogenic response30. "
"24","wild","In contrast, reactivation of TNFRI on intestinal epithelial cells increased intestinal permeability and liver disease similar to wild type mice after alcohol feeding. "
"25","wild","Indeed, intestinal iNOS expression was lower in TNFRI mutant mice after chronic alcohol feeding, while iNOS protein was similarly in MLCK deficient compared with wild type mice (Suppl. "
"26","wild","TNFRI protein expression was measured in isolated epithelial cells of the jejunum (A) and in the liver (B) of wild type (WT), TNFRIflxneo/flxneo and VillinCre TNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice. "
