"1","wild","Iap-deficient zebrafish are hypersensitive to LPS toxicity and exhibit the excessive intestinal neutrophil influx characteristic of wild-type zebrafish exposed to LPS. "
"2","wild","However, TNF is not the only mediator of LPS toxicity, as indicated by the fact that mice deficient for TNFa (Pasparakis et al., 1996), its major receptor TNFRp55 (Pfeffer et al., 1993), or both its 75 and 55 kD receptors (Rothe et al., 1993) are as sensitive as wild-type mice to interperitoneal injection with high doses of LPS, although they are more resistant to low doses of LPS administered along with the hepatocyte toxin D-galactosamine. "
"3","wild","When reared to 8 dpf, the intestines of iap-MO injected animals displayed significantly reduced AP activity as compared to wild-type (WT) intestines (Figure 1D). "
"4","wild","LPS Toxicity in Zebrafish (A) Dose-dependent killing of wild-type animals exposed to LPS at 6 dpf. "
"5","wild","Ten wildtype or myd88-MO-injected larvae were each placed in 100 ml sterile water, homogenized, diluted, and cultured on tryptic soy agar to count CFU and examine colony morphologies. "
