"1","wild","Iap-deficient zebrafish are hypersensitive to LPS toxicity and exhibit the excessive intestinal neutrophil influx characteristic of wild-type zebrafish exposed to LPS. "
"2","wild","However, TNF is not the only mediator of LPS toxicity, as indicated by the fact that mice deficient for TNFa (Pasparakis et al., 1996), its major receptor TNFRp55 (Pfeffer et al., 1993), or both its 75 and 55 kD receptors (Rothe et al., 1993) are as sensitive as wild-type mice to interperitoneal injection with high doses of LPS, although they are more resistant to low doses of LPS administered along with the hepatocyte toxin D-galactosamine. "
"3","wild","When reared to 8 dpf, the intestines of iap-MO injected animals displayed significantly reduced AP activity as compared to wild-type (WT) intestines (Figure 1D). "
"4","wild","LPS Toxicity in Zebrafish (A) Dose-dependent killing of wild-type animals exposed to LPS at 6 dpf. "
"5","wild","Ten wildtype or myd88-MO-injected larvae were each placed in 100 ml sterile water, homogenized, diluted, and cultured on tryptic soy agar to count CFU and examine colony morphologies. "
"6","mutant","Both of these Iap mutant phenotypes are dependent on Myd88 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (Tnfr), proteins also involved in LPS sensitivity in mammals. "
"7","model","We tested this idea using a zebrafish model because of the ease with which we could manipulate both bacterial associations, using gnotobiology, and host gene expression, using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs). "
"8","model","A similar transient Tnf induction was observed in a LPS induced rat model of bacteremia (Xuan et al., 2001) and in zebrafish embryos in a bacteremia model of infection with the Gram-negative fish pathogen Edwardsiella tarda (Pressley et al., 2005). "
"9","model","DISCUSSION Using a GF zebrafish model, we showed that LPS induces Iap activity during bacterial colonization of the gut (Bates et al., 2006). "
"10","model","In mouse models of septic shock, LPS is typically administered intraperitoneally at doses of approximately 50 mg/kg body weight to achieve 100% lethality and is approximately 10-fold less toxic when administered orallyMicrobe 2, 371–382, December 2007 ª2007 Elsevier Inc. "
"11","model","Together our results suggest the model that Iap, which is upregulated by the378 Cell Host & Microbe 2, 371–382, December 2007 ª2007 Emicrobiota during colonization, functions to detoxify microbiota-associated LPS, thereby establishing a homeostatic negative feedback loop that prevents excessive Tlr and Tnf signaling and intestinal inflammation (Figure 5). "
"12","model","A transgenic zebrafish model of neutrophilic inflammation. "
"13","model","MyD88 innate immune function in a zebrafish embryo infection model. "
"14","knockout","Accelerated fat absorption in intestinal alkaline phosphatase knockout mice. "
