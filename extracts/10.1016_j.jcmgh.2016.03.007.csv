"3","model","Herein, we investigated the extent to which Lcn2 regulates inflammation and gut bacterial dysbiosis in mouse models of IBD. "
"4","model","METHODS: Lcn2 expression was monitored in murine colitis models and upon microbiota ablation/restoration. "
"5","model","In addition, Lcn2 facilitates mucosal regeneration25,26 by promoting cell migration29 and by forming heterodimers with matrix metalloproteinase-9, a metalloproteinase involved in tissue repair.30 Although it is known that Lcn2 levels increased by several log orders of magnitude in various models of inflammation,11,23 including murine colitis7,8,31 and human IBD,6,32,33 the role of Lcn2 in such inflammatory states is not known. "

"8","model","The gut bacterial dysbiosis and increased bacterial burden in Lcn2KO mice did not result in spontaneous gut inflammation but, rather, eventuated in increased expression of Paneth cell–specific antimicrobial proteins Ang4 and RegIII-g54 (Figure 3F), possibly to compensate for Lcn2 deficiency.Lcn2-Deficient Mice Are Susceptible to DSS-Induced Acute Colitis and Display Colitogenic T Cells Lcn2 prevents mucosal damage by promoting mucosal regeneration in an experimental model of gastric damage.29 However, mice lacking lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase, a member of the lipocalin family of proteins, are protected from DSS-induced colitis.55 However, it still is unclear whether Lcn2 show procolitogenic or anticolitogenic properties during IBD. "

"12","knockout","Among environmental factors, gut microbiotal dysbiosis has been associated strongly with human IBD,2 underscoring the involvement of host–microbe interactions.3 Furthermore, IBD is associated with increased levels of a number of acute phase proteins (APPs) that drive or dampen the inflammatory response.4 One such APP is lipocalin 2 (Lcn2, human ortholog, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL]; also known as siderocalin, 24p3), a multifaceted July 2016 Microbiota-Dependent Colitis in Lcn2KO Mice 483antimicrobial innate immune protein whose expression is increased markedly in inflammatory diseases in both mice and human beings.5–7 Accordingly, we have shown that fecal Lcn2 is a sensitive, broadly dynamic, noninvasive biomarker of intestinal inflammation.8 However, several studies have shown that Lcn2 is not a mere bystander, but actively involved in several physiological and pathophysiological functions in IBD, renal diseases,9–11 and cancer.12,13 Among its diverse functions, one well-established role of Lcn2 is to inhibit bacterial proliferation by chelating bacterial siderophores such as enterobactin, thus limiting iron acquisition.14 However, Lcn2 alone cannot bind to ferric (Feþ3) iron; instead, it requires the aid of small chemical molecules such as mammalian siderophore 2,5 dihyoxybenzoic acid or catechol to bind and transport iron in and outside of the cell.15–17 A recent report showed that Lcn2 also can complex with Feþ3-bound epigallocatechin gallate, a polyphenol from green tea.16 Aside from its role in iron homeostasis, Lcn2 also is involved in establishing systemic hypoferremia during inflammation,13,18 inducing epithelial cell secretion of chemokine interleukin (IL)8,19,20 mediating tolerance to cellular iron overload,21 and, furthermore, serves as a survival factor for epithelial cells.22 Previously, we and Flo et al23 have shown that Lcn2-knockout (Lcn2KO) mice are highly susceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)and bacterial-induced sepsis, respectively.18 More recently, Allred et al24 showed that Lcn2 limits the deleterious health effects induced by synthetic radionuclides by mediating their physiological transport via secondary ligand-based sequestration mechanisms.
