"8","fitness","Mucosal glycan foraging enhances fitness and transmission of a saccharolytic human gut bacterial symbiont. "
"9","mutant","To determine whether a greater defect in the distal colonic mucus layer contributes to the earlier disease onset in DKO mice, we analyzed mucus layer structure in P7 WT and mutant mice, prior to colitis (Figure 1b and see Supplementary Figure S1c). "
"10","mutant","For each time point, the mean absolute value from each mutant mouse was divided by that of each WT mouse and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage of thickness relative toWTmice, and then an average percentage of thickness was obtained for each mutant mouse. "
"11","mutant","The final values are themean percentage of thickness ofmutant vs.WT mice, which are assigned a value of ‘‘100%’’. "
"12","model","To address these questions, we generated a newmousemodel that lacks both intestinal core 1– and 3–derived O-glycans (DKO). "
"13","model","In addition, compared with other colitis mouse models, the DKO develop reproducible colitis on either C57BL/6J or mixed B6/129Sv. "
"14","model","Therefore, it provides not only a more clinically relevant opportunity to dissect how components of the microbiota or the immune system contribute to each stage of colitis pathogenesis but also a valuable model to test pharmacological interventions. "
"15","model","Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host. "
"16","model","Discordance between changes in the gut microbiota and pathogenicity in a mouse model of spontaneous colitis. "
