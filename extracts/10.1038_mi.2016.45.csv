"17","disease","INTRODUCTION Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a major form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon.1 The etiology of UC remains unclear, but mounting evidence suggests it is initiated and promoted by abnormal interactions of epithelial and immune cells with the intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals.2 Defective barrier function of colonmucus has emerged as a significant factor contributing to UC pathogenesis.3 The colon is colonized by a dense, complex microbiota primarily composed of bacteria (B1012ml 1).4 These microbiota are normally sequestered from the mucosa by a mucus layer overlying the intestinal epithelium.3,5 The structural basis of the mucus layer is a polymeric network primarily comprised of the MUC2 mucin, which forms an inner stratified layer attached to the mucosal wall that is bacteria free, and a loosely attached outer layer that is colonized by the microbiota.6–8 MUC2 is extensively glycosylated with mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides (O-glycans) that make up 480% of its total mass.9 In UC patients, reduced mucus thickness and impaired O-glycosylation are reported.10,11 Muc2-deficient mice that lack amucus layer develop spontaneous colitis,8,12 indicating an important role of Muc2 in mucus function and homeostasis. "
"18","disease","To determine whether a greater defect in the distal colonic mucus layer contributes to the earlier disease onset in DKO mice, we analyzed mucus layer structure in P7 WT and mutant mice, prior to colitis (Figure 1b and see Supplementary Figure S1c). "
"19","disease","To address this, we compared disease and O-glycosylation status in the proximal colon of WT and IEC C1galt1 / mice. "
"20","disease","We therefore hypothesized that core 3–derived O-glycans protect IEC C1galt1 / proximal colon from spontaneous disease. "
"21","disease","To show that both core 1– and3–derivedO-glycans contribute to mucus layer integrity in the proximal colon, we compared glycosylation, mucus layer, and disease status of this region between 3-month-old WT, C3GnT / , IEC C1galt1 / , and DKO mice. "
"22","disease","We treated 10–12-week-old littermate WT, TM-IEC C1galt1 / , and TM-DKO with TM for 5 consecutive days and killed all mice 5 and 10 days after final TM treatment for mucus and disease analysis (Figure 3b). "
"23","disease","Antibiotic treatment rescues the mucus layer and reduces severity of colitis in DKO mice To address whether an inner mucus defect leads to increased bacterial interactions with the epithelium and subsequently contributes to colitis, WT and DKO mice were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (neomycin sulfate, metronidazole, vancomycin, ampicillin (NMVA)) for 4 weeks (Figure 4a),10,18 followed by mucus layer structure and disease analysis. "
"24","disease","Recent studies have shown that O-glycans influence microbiota composition; for example, induced loss of C1GalT1 alters microbial communities in the distal colon.34,35 Similar findings were reported with mice deficient in fucosyltransferase 2 (Fut2) responsible for terminal fucosylaton of glycans and the galactosyltransferase b4GalnT2 that forms the terminal Sd(a)/Cad carbohydrate antigen.36,37 The basis for this selection and whether glycan-mediated influences on microbiota composition reflect a dysbiotic community that potentiates colitis is unclear, although Fut2 deficiency has recently been linked to Crohn’s disease.37,38 However, it is notable among genetic studies with targeted deletion of glycosyltransferases that, to our knowledge, only lack of C1GalT1 has been shown to overtly impact mucus layer structure and elicit spontaneous colitis. "
"25","disease","Several mucindeficient mouse lines have been reported (e.g., Muc1, Muc13), but only deletion ofMuc2 results in spontaneous disease similar to DKO mice.12,39 The dynamics of disease progression differ between DKO and Muc2 / mice: colitis is evident between 1 and 2 weeks in DKO (on a C57BL/6J or mixed B6/129Sv background) mice, but only by 8 weeks inMuc2 / mice on a B6 background.39 This difference may be due to the fact that loss of core 1 and 3 O-glycans in DKO causes defects in many mucins, including Muc2. "
"26","disease","Indeed, membrane-bound mucins such as Muc1 andMuc13 have been shown to be important for intestinal barrier function during pathogen infection.40,41 However, environmental influences (e.g., facility-dependent microbial communities) may also readily explain the differences in Muc2 and intestinal O-glycan-deficient mice, as disease dynamics in Muc2 / and DKO mice from the same facility have not yet been compared side by side. "
"27","disease","The innate immune system directly responds to microbialderived signals through pattern-recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors, although their roles in microbiota-induced disease appears contingent upon the genetic defect predisposing to colitis.
