"1","wild","Furthermore, deletion of acs-yjcH-actP operon in APEC decreased its cytotoxic level to macrophages. qRT-PCR results showed that the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12β, and TNF-α) and iNOS in FY26∆acs-yjcH-actP infected macrophages were obviously down-regulated compared to that in wild-type FY26 infected cells. "
"2","wild","The construction of the single acs, actP, satP, and acs-yjcH-actP operon mutants in wild-type FY26 was based on the Red recombinase method as the previously described [32]. "
"3","wild","Growth curve For the growth experiments in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, wild-type FY26, mutants, and complemented strains were cultured over a course of 12 h at 37  °C, starting at 1.0 × 107  CFU/mL. "
"4","wild","Cells infection assays Replication rates during wild-type FY26 and its variants were measured according to the described previously [40–42]. "
"5","wild","Briefly, the monolayer HD11 cells were infected with wild-type FY26 and its variants at a MOI of 5. "
"6","wild","The duck groups (20 ducks for each group) were challenged intratracheally with bacteria at 5.0 × 105  CFU/duck (dose/duck similar to LD50 of wild-type FY26). "
"7","wild","The duck groups were challenged intratracheally with bacteria at 2.0 × 106 CFU/duck (dose/duck similar to LD90 of wild-type FY26). 15 ducks for each group were euthanized and dissected at 24 hpi to conduct systemic infection experiment. "
"8","wild","To assess survival/mortality rates were challenged intratracheally with bacteria at 5.5 × 105  CFU/ chick (dose/chick similar to LD50 of wild-type FY26). "
"9","wild","For systemic infection experiment of chick colibacillosis model, the chick groups were challenged intratracheally with bacteria at 3.0 × 106  CFU/chick (dose/ chick similar to LD90 of wild-type FY26). "
"10","wild","When wild-type FY26 was survived in HD11 macrophages, the transcription levels of acs, yjcH, and actP were obviously enhanced about 84.3-fold, 81.0-fold, and 78.2-fold at 4  hpi, respectively, compared to those under the routine culture condition (long logarithmic phase, LB broth for 6 h at 41 °C) (P < 0.01) (Figure 1A). "
"11","wild","Acetate assimilation system encoded by acs‑yjcH‑actP operon was essential for APEC growth under acetic acid as the sole carbon source To clarify the roles of this acetate assimilation system during APEC infection, the whole acs-yjcH-actP operon was deleted in wild-type FY26, and the single deletion mutants of acs, actP or satP gene were also constructed on strain FY26 (Additional file  1). "
"12","wild","Similarly, there was no difference among the growth curves of wildtype FY26, mutants FY26Δacs-yjcH-actP, FY26Δacs, FY26ΔactP, and FY26ΔsatP in M9 minimal medium without acetic acid (Figure  2B). "

"32","wild","Similarly, the cytotoxicity on RAW264.7 exposed to the complemented FY26Cacs-yjcH-actP was restored to the similar level of the wild-type FY26 (P > 0.05). "
"33","wild","Mitochondrion toxicity was also conducted in this study, but there were no differences on mitochondrion toxicity for macrophages exposed to between wild-type FY26 and mutants (data not shown). "
"34","wild","To investigate whether the over-expression of acetate assimilation system could induce inflammatory responses of APEC infected macrophages, we determined the cytokine responses between wild-type FY26 and FY26Δacs-yjcH-actP infected HD11 macrophages at 4  hpi by qRT-PCR. "
"35","wild","However, deletion of acs-yjcH-actP genes in FY26 had obvious effects on the transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in infected HD11 macrophages. qRT-PCR results showed that the transcription of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12β, TNF-α, and iNOS was obviously down-regulated in FY26ΔacsyjcH-actP infected macrophages compared to that in wild-type FY26 infected cultures at 4 hpi (P < 0.01) (Figure  5B).

"
"41","wild","Transcriptional differences of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12β, TNF-α, and iNOS among wild-type FY26, FY26Δacs-yjcH-actP, and FY26Cacs-yjcH-actP infected HD11 cells at 4 hpi were analyzed by qRT-PCR relative to that of uninfected HD11 cells. "
