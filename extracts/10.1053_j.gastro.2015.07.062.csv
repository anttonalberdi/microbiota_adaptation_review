"1","wild","Genes differentially expressed in Duoxa-/mice compared to co-housed wild type littermates were correlated with gene expression changes in early-stage IBD using gene set enrichment analysis. "
"2","wild","M AN US CR IP T AC CE PT ED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5 Materials and Methods Animals Duoxa-/and gender-matched wild type (wt) littermates in 129S6 genetic background were cohoused (3-5 animals/cage) in microisolator cages under SPF conditions 6. "
"3","mutant","B6 Duoxa-/and wt littermates (10 generation of backcrossing onto C57BL/6 background; all homozygous for the G169D Slc11a1 mutant) were orally infected with 1.5x107 cfu ST without antibiotic conditioning. "
"4","model","Detailed methods for tissue collection, mono-association of mice with SFB, human-flora associated mouse model, enteric Salmonella Typhimurium infection, dextran sodium sulfate challenge, intestinal permeability assay, microarray-based gene expression profiling, histology and morphometric analysis, 16S rRNA in situ hybridization and immunostaining, DNA and RNA extraction, realtime reverse transcription PCR (rt-qPCR), Western blotting and ileal enteroid culture are available in the Supplementary materials and methods. "
"5","model","Interestingly, induction of Duox2 in these IL-22 deficient models was associated with higher level of mucosa-adherent SFB (Figure 3F), further corroborating the concept that increased commensal-epithelial interaction can trigger Duox2 expression independently of IL-22. "
"6","model","The genes most specifically associated with CD are crucial for epithelial containment of intracellular commensals 32 and invasive pathogens, such as, Salmonella in animal models 32,33,38. "
"7","model","The mild phenotype observed in these models is not unlike the phenotype of Duoxa-/mice (Figure 7B). "
"8","model","Enteric Salmonella Typhimurium infection model Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (strain SL1344) was grown at 37°C with shaking (150 rpm) in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 100 µg/ml streptomycin. "
"9","model","In the streptomycinpretreated model 17, mice in 129S6 background were given 20 mg streptomycin orally followed 24 hours later by oral gavage with 107 cfu S. "
"10","model","In the thyphoid model, mice in C57BL6 background received 107 cfu S. "
"11","model","DSS-induced intestinal inflammation model To induce intestinal inflammation by dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS), cohoused Duoxa-/and wt littermates received drinking water with 3% DSS (36–50 kDa; MP Biomedicals) (refreshed daily). "
"12","model","To test whether DUOX status affects the extent of epithelial damage and/or epithelial wound healing in this model, mice were exposed to DSS for seven days, followed by one day on regular drinking water to initiate epithelial restitution. "
"13","model","Topology model of the DUOX/DUOXA complex and gene targeting strategy in Duoxa-deficient mice. "
"14","model","(A) Topology model depicting the heterodimeric structure of a functional DUOX enzyme complex. "
"15","model","Body weight change and survival in the DSS-induced intestinal inflammation model. "
"16","model","Acute enteral Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) infection model. "
"17","model","Typhoid model of acute enteral Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) infection. "
