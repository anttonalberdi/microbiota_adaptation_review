"3","mutant","B6 Duoxa-/and wt littermates (10 generation of backcrossing onto C57BL/6 background; all homozygous for the G169D Slc11a1 mutant) were orally infected with 1.5x107 cfu ST without antibiotic conditioning. "

"
"5","model","Interestingly, induction of Duox2 in these IL-22 deficient models was associated with higher level of mucosa-adherent SFB (Figure 3F), further corroborating the concept that increased commensal-epithelial interaction can trigger Duox2 expression independently of IL-22. "
"6","model","The genes most specifically associated with CD are crucial for epithelial containment of intracellular commensals 32 and invasive pathogens, such as, Salmonella in animal models 32,33,38. "
"7","model","The mild phenotype observed in these models is not unlike the phenotype of Duoxa-/mice (Figure 7B). "
"8","model","Enteric Salmonella Typhimurium infection model Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (strain SL1344) was grown at 37°C with shaking (150 rpm) in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 100 µg/ml streptomycin. "

"
"19","disease","M AN US CR IP T AC CE PT ED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 2 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), a hydrogen-peroxide generator at the apical membrane of gastrointestinal epithelia, is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) before the onset of inflammation, but little is known about its effects. "
"20","disease","KEYWORDS: intestine, gastroenterology, microbial dysbiosis, inflammatory bowel disease M AN US CR IP T AC CE PT ED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3 A single layer of epithelial cells constitutes a physical and immune barrier between the gutassociated lymphatic tissue (GALT) and >1013 commensal microbes in the intestinal lumen. "
"21","disease","For instance, DUOX2 is markedly upregulated in the intestine of patients with irritable bowel syndrome 7, in the normal appearing proximal small intestine after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 8, and in noninflamed ilea of patients with colon-only Crohn's disease (cCD) 9. "
"22","disease","Accordingly, the upregulation of DUOX2 in patients with quiescent ileal disease can be interpreted as a sentinel response against increased commensalepithelial interaction reflecting a defective host defense mechanism that normally keeps commensals at bay. "

"31","environment","M AN US CR IP T AC CE PT ED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6 Results Intestinal expression of DUOX2 in response to microbial colonization We initially analyzed longitudinal DUOX2 expression profiles in the gut of mice kept in our specific pathogen-free (SPF) or germfree (GF) environment. "
"32","environment","We compared mice maintained in either an SFBneg SPF environment (Jackson Laboratories; B6-Jax) with those housed in SFBpos SPF environment (Taconic Farms (B6-Tac)15 or our own SFBpos SPF animal facilities). "
"33","environment","SPF mice from these different environments had indistinguishable Duox2 expression profiles except that B6-Jax mice lacked the peak ileal expression (Figure 2A and B; Supplementary Figure S2). "
"34","environment","As expected, IL22-/-, IL23R-/and RORgt-/ (deficient in both TH17 and ILC development) mice all lacked ileal IL22 expression compared to wt controls sharing the same environment (Figure 3E). "
"35","environment","MLN-to-mucosa ratios for γ−Proteobacteria and SFB were significantly elevated in Duoxa-/mice compared to littermate controls sharing the same environment (Figure 4C; Supplementary Figure S9). "
"36","environment","In fact, even in an SPF environment (SFBpos), Duoxa-/displayed a trend towards higher ileal expression of IL-17/22 cytokines (Figure 7B; Supplementary Figure S14). "
"37","environment","One potential mechanism is the suppression of bacterial virulence within an oxidative microenvironment. "
"38","human","METHODS: We analyzed the regulation of DUOX2 in intestinal tissues of germ-free vs conventional mice, mice given antibiotics or colonized with only segmented filamentous bacteria, mice associated with human microbiota, and mice with deficiencies in interleukin (IL)23 and 22 signaling. "
"39","human","Dysbiotic, but not healthy human microbiota, activated a DUOX2 response in recipient germfree mice that corresponded to abnormal colonization of the mucosa with distinct populations of microbes. "
"40","human","Detailed methods for tissue collection, mono-association of mice with SFB, human-flora associated mouse model, enteric Salmonella Typhimurium infection, dextran sodium sulfate challenge, intestinal permeability assay, microarray-based gene expression profiling, histology and morphometric analysis, 16S rRNA in situ hybridization and immunostaining, DNA and RNA extraction, realtime reverse transcription PCR (rt-qPCR), Western blotting and ileal enteroid culture are available in the Supplementary materials and methods. "
"41","human","Dysbiotic microbiota from IBD patients confers Duox2 induction in human-microbiota associated mice M AN US CR IP T AC CE PT ED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11 Our findings above indicate that murine DUOX2 functions as an epithelial first-line defense system affecting normal mucosal immune homeostasis. "
"42","human","In humans, DUOX2 and DUOXA2 have been identified among the top upregulated genes in the ilea of IBD patients 9 including those without ileal inflammation, suggesting a role in abnormal immune homeostasis preceding the manifestation of histological lesions. "
"43","human","To explore whether abnormal microbiota is sufficient to explain overexpression of DUOX2 in the pre-clinical stage of IBD, we analyzed Duox2 expression in GF mice following association with human microbiota from IBD patients or healthy donors. "
"44","human","As observed previously 25, association of mice with normal human microbiota has little or no effect on the expression of host defense genes highly responsive to mouse microbiota (Figure 6A). "
"45","human","Although intestinal samples from mice colonized with healthy or dysbiotic human microbiota did not differ in the overall mucosa-adherent eubacterial load, there was higher mucosal association with members of the family of Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 6B). "
"46","human","Colonization of mice with healthy and dysbiotic human fecal microbiota Since mucosal dysbiosis in CD patients is not typically reflected by pronounced shifts in the microbial composition in the lumen 24, dysbiotic fecal samples were obtained from patients with active ulcerative colitis (dysbiosis at the family/phylum level confirmed by Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing; data not shown).
