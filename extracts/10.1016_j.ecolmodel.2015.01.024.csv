"1","wild","The model is compared to relevant data compiled from four published studies, which shows it reproduces the main patterns observed, including intracellular localization and inheritance of DPAs, their effect on growth rate, differences in growth rate between sibling pairs, under unstressed and heat shock conditions, for wild type and a mutant that partitions DPAs symmetrically. "
"2","wild","The model is used to estimate population growth rates of the wildtype and mutant, which shows a statistically significant benefit of aging by asymmetric DPA segregation. "
"3","wild","Specifically, we simulate colonies of aging wild-type and non-aging mutant strains and estimate their population growth rates. "
"4","wild","We quantify the effect by comparing the population growth rate of the wildtype and the mutant that partitions DPAs symmetrically (see above). "
"5","wild","From an evolutionary perspective and time scale (bacteria have een evolving for billions of years), even a small fitness benefit is elevant and can support the selection of an aging mutant over non-aging wild-type. "

"7","fitness","Is there a fitness benefit to asymmetric inheritance of DPAs? "
"8","fitness","Does it constitute a fitness benefit or cost? "
"9","fitness","Further, there is increasing realization of the importance of intestinal bacteria (including E. coli) to human health, and understanding the fitness and ecology of the gut microbiome is an important contemporary problem (Consortium, 2012; Stein et al., 2013). "
"10","fitness","Ackermann t al. (2007) presented an ABM of individual cells that accumulate nd degrade damage, which affects the survival and/or fertility (i.e. rowth rate) and is inherited with variable degree of symmetry. hese models support a fitness benefit of asymmetric damage segegation under a wide range of conditions. "
"11","fitness","Question and overview of approach Here we aim to explore and quantify the ecological fitness benefit of DPA-related aging in E. coli growing on agar plates. "
"12","fitness","For this specific case, ecological fitness can be quantified as the population growth rate. "
"13","fitness","Then we use the model to explore he role of asymmetric DPA segregation in the fitness (i.e. popuation growth rate) of the bacteria. "
"14","fitness","Asymmetric DPA segregation enhances ecological fitness We next use the model to explore the ecological role (cost or benefit) of aging, specifically asymmetric inheritance of DPAs since that is the mechanism the model explicitly resolves. "
"15","fitness","The difference between the growth rates (selection rate constant (Lenski et al., 1994)) is 0.013 day−1 and their ratio (relative fitness (Lenski and Travisano, 1994)) is 1.00026. "

"17","fitness","(2005), Chao (2010) also found a benefit to aging, but the ifference in relative fitness was only 0.00003. "
"18","fitness","Another factor to onsider is that the outcome of such a long competition experient would likely be determined by other mutations that convey stronger fitness effect. "
"19","fitness","The relative fitness in the long-term E. coli volution experiment increased to about 1.3 in the first 2000 genertions (Lenski and Travisano, 1994). "
"20","fitness","Therefore, it is unlikely that e will be able to observe the fitness benefit of aging in this case. his is a bit disheartening, but it also highlights the utility of the odel. "
"21","fitness","From an evolutionary perspective and time scale (bacteria have een evolving for billions of years), even a small fitness benefit is elevant and can support the selection of an aging mutant over non-aging wild-type. "
"22","fitness","At the low fitness advantage predicted by ur model, the fate of an aging mutant would be subject to chance genetic drift). "
"23","fitness","Did he fitness advantage of this mechanism drive its evolution or is itl Modelling 301 (2015) 62–71 69 simply a side effect (“inevitable outcome” (Lele et al., 2011; Watve et al., 2006)) of some other more significant adaptation? "
"24","fitness","For an active, energy-consuming mechanism we would expect it to have evolved as a result of the fitness benefit associated with it. "
"25","fitness","For asymmetric DPA segregation, the small effect on fitness and the passive nature of the mechanisms underlying DPA aging suggest that it is a side effect. "
"26","fitness","However, experimental evolution experiments suggest that the degree of division asymmetry (in this case observed as differences in offspring generation times) evolves towards increasing fitness, as predicted by a model (Lele et al., 2011; Watve et al., 2006). "
"27","fitness","This is in agreement with theory and other models that show a fitness benefit to asymmetric segregation of damage (but see Clegg et al. "
"28","fitness","Our conclusion about the fitness benefit emerge from a model designed consistent with the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms and parameterized consistent with the literature; and the model produces patterns consistent with observations. "
"29","fitness","However, we cannot rule out that there is not another model formulation (i.e. different equations) or parameter set that produces an equal-quality calibration (Figs. 2 and 3) but a different result or conclusion about the fitness benefit of asymmetric damage partitioning (Fig. "
