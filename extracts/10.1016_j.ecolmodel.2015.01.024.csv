"
"11","fitness","Question and overview of approach Here we aim to explore and quantify the ecological fitness benefit of DPA-related aging in E. coli growing on agar plates. "
"12","fitness","For this specific case, ecological fitness can be quantified as the population growth rate. "
"13","fitness","Then we use the model to explore he role of asymmetric DPA segregation in the fitness (i.e. popuation growth rate) of the bacteria. "

"17","fitness","(2005), Chao (2010) also found a benefit to aging, but the ifference in relative fitness was only 0.00003. "
"18","fitness","Another factor to onsider is that the outcome of such a long competition experient would likely be determined by other mutations that convey stronger fitness effect. "
"19","fitness","The relative fitness in the long-term E. coli volution experiment increased to about 1.3 in the first 2000 genertions (Lenski and Travisano, 1994). "

"24","fitness","For an active, energy-consuming mechanism we would expect it to have evolved as a result of the fitness benefit associated with it. "
"25","fitness","For asymmetric DPA segregation, the small effect on fitness and the passive nature of the mechanisms underlying DPA aging suggest that it is a side effect. "
"26","fitness","However, experimental evolution experiments suggest that the degree of division asymmetry (in this case observed as differences in offspring generation times) evolves towards increasing fitness, as predicted by a model (Lele et al., 2011; Watve et al., 2006). "

"52","model","An individual-based model (IBM, aka agentased model, ABM) of DPAs, with passive diffusion and nucleoid cclusion processes was able to reproduce the polar localization. aberi and Emberly (2010) also present an ABM that can explain olar localization of DPAs by aggregation and nucleoid occlusion. ost recently, Coquel et al. (2013) used time-lapse fluorescence icroscopy, automated image analysis and ABM to track individual PAs and established that their transport is by diffusion. "
"53","model","Modeling aging of microbes Several models have been developed and used to investigate the cological role of aging in microbes (Ackermann et al., 2007; Chao, 010; Johnson and Mangel, 2006; Rang et al., 2011; Watve et al., 006). "
"54","model","For example, Watve et al. (2006) developed a matrix model hat simulates cells with a number of growth-limiting components hat are subject to aging, affect the cell growth rate and are segreated in a symmetric or asymmetric manner at division. "

"
"56","model","Most recently, Clegg t al. (2014) presents a model that includes repair of damaged proeins to functional proteins, and that model suggests that repair (vs. symmetric inheritance) of damage is the better strategy.locations are not shown. "
"57","model","These models are all relatively simple and describe the underlying mechanisms in general terms (e.g. damage accumulation), which means they are easy to understand and can be used to reach general conclusions. "
"58","model","For example, none of the existing models explicitly considers the aggregation of damage and heterogeneity of DPA sizes. "
"59","model","A number of more mechanistically detailed models of DPA aggregation and localization in E. coli have recently been developed, but they do not extend beyond the cell level and cannot be used to estimate population growth rates (Coquel et al., 2013; Saberi and Emberly, 2010; Winkler et al., 2010). "
"60","model","Our strategy is to develop a model of E. coli including the mechanisms needed to reproduce relevant observed patterns (e.g. growth rate differences between sibling pairs, DPA localization the cell). "
"61","model","This general approach for the analysis of complex systems has been referred to as pattern-oriented modeling (Grimm et al., 2005). "
"62","model","Then we use the model as an experimental system to quantify the benefit of this trait. "
"63","model","Compared to most previous models of aging in microbes, our model is relatively specific (i.e. "
"64","model","E. coli, on agar plates, DPA-related aging) and can be considered a “tactical” model (sensu (Evans et al., 2013)). "
"65","model","The problem at hand is challenging from a modeling perspective, because it involves the role of intracellular mechanisms in 6 logica t b r f h ( 2 c i o d a a w t 2 s i t t t l a n e H t p 2 2 g u g a b ( 2 d r R ( r e i b a e p e m e o S t n t 4 K.Z. "

"68","model","Previous models of his process were built using agent-based methods (Coquel et al., 013; Saberi and Emberly, 2010; Winkler et al., 2010). "
"69","model","We present the model and compare it to relevant experimenal data from the literature, which shows that it is consistent with he main observed patterns. "
"70","model","Then we use the model to explore he role of asymmetric DPA segregation in the fitness (i.e. popuation growth rate) of the bacteria. "
"71","model","Overview The model simulates individual cells as spherocylinders that row, divide and shove each other. "
"72","model","Inside the cells, the model simlates the nucleoid and a number of DPAs. "
"73","model","A number of different formulations, including making he effect a function of the mass of DPAs, were evaluated but could ot reproduce the observed pattern using our model. "
"74","model","Therefore, he DPA effect is modeled as a function of the total surface area ofl Modelling 301 (2015) 62–71 DPAs in the cell (fd = Kd aa), where Kd (m−2) is the damage effect constant and aa (m2) is the DPA surface area. "
"75","model","Previous models of aging use different formulations for damage effect, including a saturating equation (Erjavec et al., 2008). "
"76","model","This approach to modeling aging is simplified and the actual mechanisms are undoubtedly much more complex. "
"77","model","However it allows us to simulate colony growth on a petri dish and generate pictures and movies of the spatial configuration of cells and DPAs, which help understand the behavior of the model (e.g. diffusion of DPAs of different sizes, see Section 3.2) and can be compared to observations (see Fig. "

"79","model","Left = data, right = model. "
"80","model","Top = data, bottom = model. "
"81","model","Symbols are data and lines are model. "
"82","model","Nucleoid Various approaches have been used to model the nucleoid, ncluding specifying a repulsive velocity potential (Winkler et al., 010), immobile obstacles (Coquel et al., 2013) and dynamically imulating the DNA molecule as a circular polymer (Saberi and mberly, 2010). "
"83","model","Here, the nucleoid is modeled as one or two spheocylinders. "
"84","model","Damaged protein aggregates (DPAs) Past microbe aging models use varying approaches to simulate damaged proteins (for a more thorough review, see Clegg et al. "

"91","model","Parameter values The model includes 21 parameters, which were assigned vales consistent with the literature (where available, Table S1). everal parameters are not constrained well by the available iterature and they were calibrated to match the observations Figs. 2 and 3, discussed later). "
"92","model","The protein damage and removal parameters (kd, kr,p) were adjusted so that the model produces an average maximum DPA size of about 1 × 104 proteins DPA−1, which seems a reasonable value. "
"93","model","The model is applied to a number of datasets from experiments with different strains and experimental conditions. "
"94","model","Statistical significance testing To test if asymmetric DPA inheritance is beneficial, we compare the mean growth rate from the model with asymmetric DPA inheritance to that from the model with symmetric DPA inheritance. "
"95","model","The model is stochastic and we base the statistical significance of the results on a two-sample, one-tailed t-test. "
"96","model","The modelpredicted growth rates are normally distributed (see Fig. "
"97","model","Model is consistent with observed patterns The model was compared to relevant data compiled from four published studies (Coquel et al., 2013; Lindner et al., 2008; Stewart et al., 2005; Winkler et al., 2010). "
"98","model","The comparison shows that the model reproduces the main observed patterns qualitatively and quantitatively (Figs. 2 and 3). "
"99","model","The higher number of DPAs under heat shock is reproduced by the model using a higher protein damage rate (see above). "
"100","model","The model also captures the distribution of DPAs along the cell axis at various times, including the symmetric initial position and asymmetric, old-pole localization after divisions and over the entire experiment (Fig. "
"101","model","Consistent with observations, the model shows DPAs along the entire cell axis with a minor peak at the center. "
"102","model","In the model this feature is due to the larger nucleoid-free volume at the cell center when the nucleoid divides prior to division (see Fig. "
"103","model","However, the model underestimates the magnitude of this peak, which may be due to the simplified representation of the nucleoid (see above). "
"104","model","There is a correlation between damage and growth rate, with old-pole cells having higher damage and lower growth rates, a pattern that is reproduced by the model (Fig. "
