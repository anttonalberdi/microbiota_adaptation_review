"1","wild","While the overall diversity of the microbiota of both wild type and IL-10-/were similar in young mice, the latter failed to increase in complexity as the mice matured and experienced changes in abundance of specific bacterial taxa that are associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans. "
"2","wild","These results build upon prior work evaluating the C3Bir IL-10-/mouse model and reveals a strong correlation between levels of inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and chemokines) and the failure to develop a diverse and rich microbial community that otherwise occurs in wildtype mice (4, 38, 39)."
"3","wild","Concentrations of KC (A) and IL-17 (B) were measured in the serum of wild type (white bars) an IL-10-/mice. "
"4","adaptation","These differences likely represent adaptations in the functions of the microbial community in the C3Bir IL-10-/mice in response to the chronic gastrointestinal inflammation and the use of metabolic biomarkers may represent useful biomarkers to better understand the role of inflammation in shaping the gut microbiota. "
"5","model","Studies using rodent models as well as characterization of IBD patients, strongly implicate the gut microbiota as having a significant impact on the pathogenesis of colitis (5–8). "
"6","model","While IL-10-/mouse models have been used to correlate differences in bacterial taxa present with the severity of inflammation (38–41), we reasoned that additional insights into the disease process can be gained from a longitudinalFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2study that describe the dynamic changes in the microbiota over multiple time points as inflammation progresses (11, 42). "
"7","model","To address this unknown, we used C3Bir.129P2(B6)-Il10tm1Cgn/Lt (C3Bir IL-10-/-) mice as a genetic model of gastrointestinal inflammation (28, 30, 43–45). "
"8","model","These results build upon prior work evaluating the C3Bir IL-10-/mouse model and reveals a strong correlation between levels of inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and chemokines) and the failure to develop a diverse and rich microbial community that otherwise occurs in wildtype mice (4, 38, 39)."
"9","model","A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used for the previously mentioned data, with treatment group, time and their interaction as fixed effects. "
"10","model","The 454 pyrosequencing data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model, with the same fixed effects structure. "
"11","model","This is consistent with previous studies using this IL-10-/mouse model (3, 4). "
"12","model","Work by Matharu et al. also implicate the secretion of both IL-17 and IFN-g from dysregulated CD4+ regulatory T cells (TREG) in their model of IL-10 -/colitis where the mice were deficient in both IL-10 and TLR4 (58). "
"13","model","Using a model of Helicobacter-induced IL-10-/mouse of colitis, Yang and colleagues demonstrated that mice housed within different facilities developed colitis with characteristically different levels of inflammation. "
"14","model","Using a 129/ SvEv IL-10-/mouse model of colorectal cancer, there is evidence that the nature of intestinal inflammation elicits changes in the microbiota (61). "
"15","model","IL-17 is increased in humans with IBD and has been associated with intestinal inflammation in several animal models (42, 71, 72). "
"16","model","Previous studies using the IL10-/model of colitis have either used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for their analysis of microbial compositional (40, 42) or have only collected fecal pellets for 4 weeks post-colonization of germ-free mice with a SPF microbiota or at 8 and 10 weeks of age (39). "
"17","model","The gut microbiota in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. "
"18","model","A multihit model: Colitis lessons from the Interleukin-10-deficient mouse. "
"19","model","Lessons from genetically engineered animal models. "
"20","model","Differing complex microbiota alter disease severity of the IL-10-/mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. "
"21","model","Mapping colitis susceptibility in mouse models: distal chromosome 3 contains major loci related to Cdcs1. "
"22","model","Decreased colonization of fecal Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment. "
"23","knockout","In contrast, when Redhu et al. compared the fecal microbiota in IL-10 receptor knockout mice, they observed no differences in microbial diversity between the WT and IL-10R-/mice over time (41). "
