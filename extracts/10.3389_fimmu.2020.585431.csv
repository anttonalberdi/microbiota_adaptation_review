"1","wild","While the overall diversity of the microbiota of both wild type and IL-10-/were similar in young mice, the latter failed to increase in complexity as the mice matured and experienced changes in abundance of specific bacterial taxa that are associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans. "
"2","wild","These results build upon prior work evaluating the C3Bir IL-10-/mouse model and reveals a strong correlation between levels of inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and chemokines) and the failure to develop a diverse and rich microbial community that otherwise occurs in wildtype mice (4, 38, 39)."
"3","wild","Concentrations of KC (A) and IL-17 (B) were measured in the serum of wild type (white bars) an IL-10-/mice. "
"4","adaptation","These differences likely represent adaptations in the functions of the microbial community in the C3Bir IL-10-/mice in response to the chronic gastrointestinal inflammation and the use of metabolic biomarkers may represent useful biomarkers to better understand the role of inflammation in shaping the gut microbiota.
