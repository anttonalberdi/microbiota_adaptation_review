"1","wild","A recent study in 10 wild American black bears demonstrated that normal wound healing was maintained in hibernation, despite reduced skin temperatures, which were 4 – 6 °C lower than the hibernation body temperature (28). "
"2","wild","Increased levels of A2M protein in hibernating brown bears was also found by Mominoki et al. (26); and Sheikh et al. (29) demonstrated similar increases in serum A2M from wild black bears using anti-bear A2M rabbit polyclonal antibodies. "
"3","wild","Recently, Sommer et al. (21) analyzed metabolites by mass spectrometry in serum from 12 to 15 wild brown bears and confirmed the presence of significantly increased levels of free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides in hibernation, and they also determined the levels of various bile salts, which decreased in hibernation.

"7","adaptat","We quantified the biochemical adaptations for hibernation by comparing the proteome, metabolome, and hematological features of blood from hibernating and active free-ranging subadult brown bears with a focus on conservation of health and energy. "
"8","adaptat","The comprehensive global data identified novel biochemical strategies for bear adaptations to the extreme condition of hibernation and have implications for our understanding of physiology in general. "
"9","adaptat","The ability to hibernate is an old evolutionary adaptation used by very different families of mammals. "
"10","adaptat","Despite a wealth of information on hibernation and torpor physiology, the trigger of the physiological adaptations remains elusive (1–3). "
"11","adaptat","Nitrogen Metabolism—It is a major challenge to the physiological adaptations for hibernation in bears to conserve and recycle nitrogen in protein metabolism within the metabolic energy available in this condition, while avoiding intoxication. "
"12","adaptat","We discovered a number of specific adaptations to hibernation involving defense against pathogens, lipid transport and metabolism, iron and nitrogen conservation, total protein levels, and half-lives. "
"13","adaptat","The biochemical data have been interpreted in the context of known physiological adaptations. "
"14","adaptat","Therefore, we conclude that decreased levels of the majority of blood plasma proteins and the maintenance or increase of levels of just a few key proteins in blood plasma by liver protein synthesis are the principal energy savers in bear hibernation adaptation, due to dehydration, a lowered temperature, a general downregulation of translation, and a balanced translation of effector and regulator proteins in the complement and blood clotting pathways.

"18","model","For these reasons, the hibernating bear is a fascinating model in the biological and medical science fields. "
"19","model","However, our molecular modeling of this C3-like domain was inconclusive in this respect and further analysis will be needed. "
"20","model","Schwanhäusser et al. (38) quantified mRNA and protein levels and their half-lives globally in pulse-labeled mouse fibroblast cultures, and they derived a model predicting protein abundance in cells. "
"21","model","Our results reveal a number of unexpected changes in protein concentration in hibernation, some expanding fundamental physiological understanding derived from human and non-hibernating animal models. "

"28","human","The bear protein database we used (supplemental file bear-protein-db-Febr2013.txt) was derived from the genome sequence of polar bear Ursus maritimus (17) and annotated by BlastP against the non-redundant human NCBI Reference Sequence Database. "
"29","human","The natural hemoglobin concentration in bear plasma therefore remains unknown and might be like that in healthy humans, in whom the range is 0.01–0.04 g liter1. "

"33","human","In addition to the well studied human complement components, we found a C3-like component (W/S ratio 0.45), which is 40% identical in amino acid sequence to human C3. "
"34","human","This component is present also in giant panda, dog, and pig but not in human or mouse. "
"35","human","In human C3, C4, and A2M proteins, the active site thiol ester-forming sequences linking Cys and Gln are Cys-Gly-Glu-Gln. "
"36","human","However, the role of F12, if any, in normal hemostasis is unclear as humans and animals totally deficient in F12 have no bleeding tendency. "
"37","human","The human chromosome 11q23 contains a gene cluster that encodes apolipoproteins APOA1 (W/S ratio 0.60), APOC3 (W/S ratio 0.75, p  0.11), and APOA4 (W/S ratio 0.04). "
"38","human","We characterized the extreme changes in metabolic conditions in hibernation by targeted mass spectrometry quantifying 40 carnitines, 90 phosphatidylcholines, including lyso-PC with one acyl group, PCaa with two acyl groups, and PCae with one acyl and one alkyl ether group, 15 sphingomyelins, 21 amino acids, 19 biogenic amines, and hexose sugars in plasma of hibernating and active bears and a human plasma reference sample (supplemental Table S2; and Fig. "
"39","human","The mean hexose levels in winter and summer bear samples and in the human reference were 10.0, 8.9, and 8.2 mM, respectively. "
"40","human","The sum concentrations of all carnitines in winter and summer bear samples and in human samples were 95, 56, and 61 M, respectively. "
"41","human","The sum concentrations of lyso-PC of hibernating bears and human were similar, 265 and 251 M, respectively. "
"42","human","Concentrations of individual PCaa and PCae in bear followed the pattern of the corresponding concentrations of these products in the human sample. "
"43","human","However, the total concentrations in bear plasma were 2.6 – 4.6-fold those in human. "
"44","human","The concentrations of total PCaa in hibernation, summer, and human samples were 4.3, 3.6, and 1.4 mM, respectively. "
"45","human","The total PCae concentrations in winter, summer, and human were lower, 664, 846, and 185 M, respectively. "
"46","human","However, they were 2–5-fold higher than the levels of these metabolites in human plasma. "
"47","human","Total sphingomyelin concentrations in winter, summer, and in the human sample were 745, 710, and 257 M, respectively. "
"48","human","We analyzed amino acids and biogenic amines as phenylisothiocyanate derivatives by targeted mass spectrometry and found the plasma concentrations of these factors in bear were mostly within 50% of the reference range for humans (supplemental Table S2). "
"49","human","Our analysis of the human reference plasma sample did not reveal any SHBG immunoreactive bands, suggesting that the SHBG levels in hibernating bears are markedly higher than the average human plasma levels (normal range 20 –120 nM in adults). "
"50","human","The high hibernation levels of total protein were similar among all bears and similar to the normal human levels, whereas the lower summer levels showed considerable variance, because blood plasma concentration depends on the changing water content of available summer forage. "
"51","human","Most studies have applied anti-human antibodies, which in many cases have borderline cross-reactivity with bear proteins in our experience, due to limited amino acid sequence identity (supplemental Table S1). "
"52","human","Bear and human A2M are 81% identical in sequence and do cross-react, because of their large 180-kDa subunit sizes, which increase the probability of conserved immunogenic epitopes. "
"53","human","Hence, humans seem to tolerate increased A2M levels well, like bears in hibernation, which on average benefit from a 1.7-fold increase in A2M levels. "
"54","human","The similar concentrations of sphingomyelins in winter and summer plasma were 2–5-fold greater than the concentrations in human plasma (supplemental Table S2), and they may protect bear cell membranes against degradation and rupture. "
"55","human","Arinell et al. (14) reported increases in the levels of total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides in hibernating brown bears and showed that none of the 12 examined bears exhibited signs of atherosclerosis, unlike humans with similarly elevated plasma lipid levels. "
"56","human","Intracellular proteins have short half-lives, minutes to days, whereas circulating ALB and IGG can last for months in humans (35). "
"57","human","In fact, high circulating SHBG levels in humans protect against metabolic syndrome and increase insulin sensitivity independent of sex hormone concentrations (44). "

"
"64","human","Peptides were adsorbed to 1 mg of washed R3 Poros beads (Applied Biosystems) in a 20-l suspension of 5% formic acid added to the collection tube, together with 5 pmol of human [Glu1]fibrinopeptide B for internal MS standard (Sigma) just before the final peptide extraction by water. "
"65","human","The genome sequences of polar bear and brown bear are similar, showing, on average, two substitutions per 1000 bp (48). 93% could be annotated by homology using a BLASTP search against the human RefSeq database (E-value 1 105). "
"66","human","This Uma db contained 21,143 entries; 42% showed 90% identity to the human homolog. "
"67","human","W/S ratios of proteins identified by two unique peptides and seen in at least four of seven bears were saved in Proteins.xlsx (supplemental Table S1) using the gene names of human homologs, together with their Uma and Uniprot ID, fold change and log2 fold change, paired t test p values, and Uniprot function descriptions.
