"1","wild","A recent study in 10 wild American black bears demonstrated that normal wound healing was maintained in hibernation, despite reduced skin temperatures, which were 4 – 6 °C lower than the hibernation body temperature (28). "
"2","wild","Increased levels of A2M protein in hibernating brown bears was also found by Mominoki et al. (26); and Sheikh et al. (29) demonstrated similar increases in serum A2M from wild black bears using anti-bear A2M rabbit polyclonal antibodies. "
"3","wild","Recently, Sommer et al. (21) analyzed metabolites by mass spectrometry in serum from 12 to 15 wild brown bears and confirmed the presence of significantly increased levels of free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides in hibernation, and they also determined the levels of various bile salts, which decreased in hibernation.

"6","wild","(2003) Elevated levels of serum 2-macroglobulin in wild black bears during hibernation. "
"7","adaptation","We quantified the biochemical adaptations for hibernation by comparing the proteome, metabolome, and hematological features of blood from hibernating and active free-ranging subadult brown bears with a focus on conservation of health and energy. "
"8","adaptation","The comprehensive global data identified novel biochemical strategies for bear adaptations to the extreme condition of hibernation and have implications for our understanding of physiology in general. "
"9","adaptation","The ability to hibernate is an old evolutionary adaptation used by very different families of mammals. "
"10","adaptation","Despite a wealth of information on hibernation and torpor physiology, the trigger of the physiological adaptations remains elusive (1–3). "
"11","adaptation","Nitrogen Metabolism—It is a major challenge to the physiological adaptations for hibernation in bears to conserve and recycle nitrogen in protein metabolism within the metabolic energy available in this condition, while avoiding intoxication. "
"12","adaptation","We discovered a number of specific adaptations to hibernation involving defense against pathogens, lipid transport and metabolism, iron and nitrogen conservation, total protein levels, and half-lives. "
"13","adaptation","The biochemical data have been interpreted in the context of known physiological adaptations. "
"14","adaptation","Therefore, we conclude that decreased levels of the majority of blood plasma proteins and the maintenance or increase of levels of just a few key proteins in blood plasma by liver protein synthesis are the principal energy savers in bear hibernation adaptation, due to dehydration, a lowered temperature, a general downregulation of translation, and a balanced translation of effector and regulator proteins in the complement and blood clotting pathways.

"18","model","For these reasons, the hibernating bear is a fascinating model in the biological and medical science fields. "
"19","model","However, our molecular modeling of this C3-like domain was inconclusive in this respect and further analysis will be needed. "
"20","model","Schwanhäusser et al. (38) quantified mRNA and protein levels and their half-lives globally in pulse-labeled mouse fibroblast cultures, and they derived a model predicting protein abundance in cells. "
"21","model","Our results reveal a number of unexpected changes in protein concentration in hibernation, some expanding fundamental physiological understanding derived from human and non-hibernating animal models. "
