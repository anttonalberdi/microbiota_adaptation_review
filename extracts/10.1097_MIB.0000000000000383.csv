"1","wild","Methods: ICR was performed in 129S1/SvlmJ IL102/2 mice followed by FMT using stool from wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","As well, we performed a fecal microbial transplant (FMT) after ICR using stool from healthy wild-type donor animals to attempt to restore microbial diversity and composition. "
"3","wild","Stools were collected from healthy age-matched wild-type 129S1/SvlmJ mice (n ¼ 4) and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) reduced with 0.05% cysteine HCl (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co, Oakville, Canada) at a ratio of 1 fecal pellet/mL. "
"4","wild","Previous studies have shown that wild-type mice have significantly different microbial composition compared with IL-102/2 mice.11,14 The fecal slurry was passed through a 100 mm cell strainer and 200 mL delivered to the FMT group by oral gavage (FMT). "
"5","model","(Inflamm Bowel Dis 2015;21:1479–1490) Key Words: colitis, dysbiosis, metagenome, dendritic cells, Crohn’s disease S urgery remains a necessary treatment for most patients withCrohn’s disease (CD), with resection of the ileocecal region (ICR) being most common.1 However, rapid recurrence at the anastomosis commonly occurs, and it is believed that recurrence is due to loss of the ileocecal valve, thereby introducing colonic bacteria into the ileum.2 Studies in humans and animal models have highlighted the interaction of the gut immune system with its microbial inhabitants as central to CD pathogenesis,3 but little work has been performed to study this relationship in postoperative disease. "
"6","model","Mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) including macrophages (MF) and dendritic cells (DCs) are found in large numbers in the gut lamina propria (LP).4 Under steady-state conditions, intestinal macrophages clear antigens without evoking inflammatory responses whereas DCs promote tolerance by trafficking antigen to mesenteric lymph nodes and inducing T regulatory cells.5,6 After surgery, MP subsets undergo significant perturbations because of their recruitment and role in tissue repair and wound healing.7 IL-10 gene-deficient (IL-102/2) mice spontaneously develop a patchy chronic inflammation primarily in the ileum, cecum, and colon shortly after weaning.8,9 The development of colitis in this model is highly dependent on the environment, especially the composition of the gut microbiota, and treatment aimed at modulating the colonic microbiota has shown benefit.10,11 Recently, a surgical resection model was defined in IL-102/2 mice, whereby a severe ileitis developed after ICR, mimicking the human condition.12 In this study, we further refined this model of ileocecal resection in IL-102/2 mice analogous to the procedure commonly performed for ileocecal CD in humans and performed a metagenomic analysis of microbial changes related to surgery.

"7","model","Clostridium cluster IV is a major butyrate producer, and depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease microbiota has been shown.24 Butyrate is a major energy source for enterocytes, and lack of butyrate can lead to energy deprivation, reduced barrier function, and increased bacterial translocation.25 Overall, the microbiome in CD demonstrates a loss of numerous processes important for gut health including short chain fatty acid, vitamin, and amino acid biosynthesis, along with increased aerotolerance, nutrient import, and toxin secretion, similar to our animal model.26 Thus, it could be postulated that a reduction in butyrate production because of a decrease in Clostridium cluster IV could have played a role in the microbial and immunological changes observed after surgery. "
"8","model","The increased bacterial load in the neoterminal ileum seen in our model is similar to that seen in humans after resection.39 Results from this study may help explain the efficacy of early postoperative antibiotics in preventing postoperative recurrence, as the ileal segment is unable to appropriately deal with invading microbes in the postoperative period.40 Furthermore, the induction of a gut microbiome with low complexity because of oxidative stress could facilitate the overgrowth of pathogens and/or pathobionts, which may eventually colonize the vulnerable neoterminal ileum, providing an explanation for the occurrence of invasive Escherichia coli in postoperative CD lesions.41 In conclusion, we propose that surgery causes a loss of microbial diversity and induction of aerotolerant organisms that together with impaired microbial clearance because of immunosuppression results in bacterial overgrowth and increased translocation in the neoterminal ileum.
