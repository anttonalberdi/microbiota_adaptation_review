"1","wild","Methods: ICR was performed in 129S1/SvlmJ IL102/2 mice followed by FMT using stool from wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","As well, we performed a fecal microbial transplant (FMT) after ICR using stool from healthy wild-type donor animals to attempt to restore microbial diversity and composition. "
"3","wild","Stools were collected from healthy age-matched wild-type 129S1/SvlmJ mice (n Â¼ 4) and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) reduced with 0.05% cysteine HCl (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co, Oakville, Canada) at a ratio of 1 fecal pellet/mL. "
"4","wild","Previous studies have shown that wild-type mice have significantly different microbial composition compared with IL-102/2 mice.11,14 The fecal slurry was passed through a 100 mm cell strainer and 200 mL delivered to the FMT group by oral gavage (FMT). "
