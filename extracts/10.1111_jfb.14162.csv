"1","wild","We took 526 sub-adult captive-reared delta smelt and cultured them for 200 days without providing artificial food or water quality management to assess their performance once released in the wild. "
"2","wild","The results indicated captive-reared sub-adult delta smelt could survive in a semi-natural environment with uncontrolled water quality and naturally produced wild prey through spawning and into their post spawning phase. "
"3","wild","It is challenging to maintain a genetically sound population in captivity with the intention of releasing them into the wild (Crawford & Muir, 2008). "
"4","wild","Adults are genetically tested to create a pedigree to determine crossings of least related individuals and to keep equal representation among families with wildcaught delta smelt added into the breeding pool annually (Finger et al., 2018; Lindberg et al., 2013). "
"5","wild","However, all of these efforts to minimise kinship and keep the genetics of the cultured population as close as possible to the wild do not guarantee success as a recent study found the relative reproductive success of pair crosses with at least one wild delta smelt parent was lower than the ones with two cultured parents (Finger et al., 2017). "
"6","wild","Other problems may arise when trying to raise fish in a controlled system for future release into the wild. "
"7","wild","We used 526 sub-adult (297 days post hatch; dph) delta smelt that were the ninth generation (F9) removed from the wild at the FCCL. "
"8","wild","Previous studies have shown that cultured fish have a low return rate, meaning that they do not survive as well as their wild counterparts (Jonsson & Jonsson, 2014; Kallio-Nyberg et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2014). "
"9","wild","Since hatchery and wild fish grow up in very different environments, differential experience is likely to generate behavioural differences (Brown & Day, 2002). "
"10","wild","Releasing captive-reared delta smelt along with regulations that protect the fish species in the wild could help mitigate population decline in nature (Jutila et al., 2003) and this study demonstrated if delta smelt were raised in captivity to near-adulthood and then either fully liberated or released into field enclosures, the fish would learn to feed themselves and potentially survive in the wild. "
"11","wild","This study is one step in that direction providing information needed to proceed with studies and hopefully 1 day the release of cultured delta smelt into the wild and keep this species from extinction. "
