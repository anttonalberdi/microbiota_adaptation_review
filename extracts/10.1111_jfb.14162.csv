"1","wild","We took 526 sub-adult captive-reared delta smelt and cultured them for 200 days without providing artificial food or water quality management to assess their performance once released in the wild. "
"2","wild","The results indicated captive-reared sub-adult delta smelt could survive in a semi-natural environment with uncontrolled water quality and naturally produced wild prey through spawning and into their post spawning phase. "
"3","wild","It is challenging to maintain a genetically sound population in captivity with the intention of releasing them into the wild (Crawford & Muir, 2008). "
"4","wild","Adults are genetically tested to create a pedigree to determine crossings of least related individuals and to keep equal representation among families with wildcaught delta smelt added into the breeding pool annually (Finger et al., 2018; Lindberg et al., 2013). "
"5","wild","However, all of these efforts to minimise kinship and keep the genetics of the cultured population as close as possible to the wild do not guarantee success as a recent study found the relative reproductive success of pair crosses with at least one wild delta smelt parent was lower than the ones with two cultured parents (Finger et al., 2017). "
"6","wild","Other problems may arise when trying to raise fish in a controlled system for future release into the wild. "
"7","wild","We used 526 sub-adult (297 days post hatch; dph) delta smelt that were the ninth generation (F9) removed from the wild at the FCCL. "
"8","wild","Previous studies have shown that cultured fish have a low return rate, meaning that they do not survive as well as their wild counterparts (Jonsson & Jonsson, 2014; Kallio-Nyberg et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2014). "
"9","wild","Since hatchery and wild fish grow up in very different environments, differential experience is likely to generate behavioural differences (Brown & Day, 2002). "
"10","wild","Releasing captive-reared delta smelt along with regulations that protect the fish species in the wild could help mitigate population decline in nature (Jutila et al., 2003) and this study demonstrated if delta smelt were raised in captivity to near-adulthood and then either fully liberated or released into field enclosures, the fish would learn to feed themselves and potentially survive in the wild. "
"11","wild","This study is one step in that direction providing information needed to proceed with studies and hopefully 1 day the release of cultured delta smelt into the wild and keep this species from extinction. "

"21","adaptat","A conservation hatchery population of delta smelt shows evidence of genetic adaptation to captivity after 9 generations. "
"22","disease","In addition, on day 161, 11 of the 15 fish sampled showed signs of parasite infestation by whitespot disease Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. "
"23","disease","Based on the author's experience and previous studies, the females were usually weak and easily susceptible to disease after a spawning event (Bennett, 2005). "

"26","environment","K E YWORD S captive, delta smelt, refuge population, reintroduction, semi-natural environment Multiple factors have affected aquatic organisms in the San Francisco Estuary since the first European settlement, including habitat alteration, water diversions, flow regime alterations and introduction of exotic species (Bennett & Moyle, 1996; Brown & Moyle, 2005; Moyle et al., 2010; Moyle, Katz et al., 2011; Sommer et al., 2007). "
"27","environment","Fish reared and released for the purpose of rehabilitating populations have been housed in predator-free conventional hatchery environments with plenty of food, allowing better survival through the earliest life stages than nature does. "
"28","environment","Consequently, the main goals of this study were to see if captive-reared delta smelt can: (a) learn to find natural prey on their own; (b) forage on natural prey effectively enough to maintain a similar body condition to fish in captivity; (c) have similar survival foraging on natural prey as the control fish reared in the captive environment at the FCCL.

"
"30","environment","The survival trend for cultured fish in a semi-natural environment was similar to the survival of the control group, but a large die-off occurred in the trough between days 197 and 200, which led to the termination of the study. "
"31","environment","The condition factor of delta smelt fluctuated throughout the duration of the study, possibly due to being moved into a semi-natural environment instead of being in a stable laboratory environment. "
"32","environment","Changes in the environment (Hammock et al., 2017) due to temperature or turbidity could also be causes of the decline in body condition. "
"33","environment","There are various factors that can contribute to their survivability after release including predation (Jonsson & Jonsson, 2006), domestication (Huntingford, 2004), interspecific competition (Houde et al., 2017; Miyasaka et al., 2003; Mookerji et al., 2004), food availability (Kallio-Nyberg et al., 2011), health and composition of the environment (Crawford & Muir, 2008; Serrano et al., 2009), bodily makeup of the fish (Serrano et al., 2009), their athleticism (Zhang et al., 2016), size and age (Irvine et al., 2013). "
"34","environment","Since hatchery and wild fish grow up in very different environments, differential experience is likely to generate behavioural differences (Brown & Day, 2002). "
"35","environment","If we could increase the complexity of the captive environment for delta smelt, then they might have greater survival if released. "
"36","environment","There are studies illustrating how simple enrichment of the rearing environment affects learning ability, foraging skills, social behaviour, predator avoidance, aggression and reproductive success (Berejikian et al., 2000; Salvanes & Braithwaite, 2005; Brown et al., 2003; Fleming et al., 1997).
