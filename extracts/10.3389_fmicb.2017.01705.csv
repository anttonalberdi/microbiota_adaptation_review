"1","wild","Compared with captive forest musk deer, wild forest musk deer have a wider feeding range with no dietary limitations, and their gut microbiota are in a relatively natural state. "
"2","wild","However, no reports have compared the gut microbiota between wild and captive forest musk deer. "
"3","wild","To gain insight into the composition of gut microbiota in forest musk deer under different food-source conditions, we employed high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing technology to investigate differences in the gut microbiota occurring between captive and wild forest musk deer. "
"4","wild","Both captive and wild forest musk deer showed similar microbiota at the phylum level, which consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, although significant differences were found in their relative abundances between both groups. α-Diversity results showed that no significant differences occurred in the microbiota between both groups, while β-diversity results showed that significant differences did occur in their microbiota compositions. "
"5","wild","In summary, our results provide important information for improving feed preparation for captive forest musk deer and implementing projects where captive forest musk deer are released into the wild. "
"6","wild","However, the wild forest musk deer population has dropped sharply in the last 50 years, due to indiscriminate poaching and a reduction in natural habitat areas. "
"7","wild","To relieve resource pressure on wild forest musk deer, China has attempted artificial breeding of forest musk deer since the 1950s. "
"8","wild","However, to date, there has been a lack of studies comparing the gut microbiota between wild and captive forest musk deer. "
"9","wild","Forest musk deer are ruminants, and comparing the gut microbiota between wild and captive forest musk deer may reveal the effects of dietary factors on the physiological functions of the digestive tract. "
"10","wild","By comparison, in this study, we collected fresh fecal matters from wild and captive forest musk deer in the same period. "
"11","wild","This was the first time to compare differences in the compositions of gut microbiota between wild and captive forest musk deer under different food-source conditions. "
"12","wild","Collection of fecal samples from wild forest musk deer was performed at the Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve in the Sichuan province. "
"13","wild","In contrast, wild forest musk deer mainly consumed wild high-fiber plant leaves in their diets. "
"14","wild","Totally, nine wild forest musk deer feces samples were selected. "
"15","wild","Therefore, we can ensure that these wild samples were all from different individuals. "
"16","wild","RESULTS Analysis of rRNA Sequencing Results The Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform was used to amplify and detect 16S rRNA gene product sequences from fecal microbiota of 9 wild and 10 captive forest musk deer. "
"17","wild","Comparison of the Gut Microbiota between Captive and Wild Forest Musk Deer A Venn diagram was used to confirm the core gut microbiota present in wild and captive forest musk deer. "
"18","wild","In the wild forest musk deer group, the number of OTUs common to all forest musk deer individuals was 296. "
"19","wild","Red dots represent captive forest musk deer samples, and blue squares represent wild forest musk deer samples. "
"20","wild","Diversity Analysis of Microbiota in Captive and Wild Forest Musk Deer We calculated α-diversity (Ace, Chao 1, Shannon, and Simpson) and β-diversity indices of captive and wild forest musk deer (Table 1). "
"21","wild","The Ace values in captive and wild forest musk deer were 569.27 ± 35.37 and 557.89 ± 31.92, respectively (P > 0.05). "
"22","wild","PCoA demonstrated the differences of microbiota in the captive and wild samples (Figure 3), the ordination plot shows that the captive and wild samples are clearly separated, which means that the microbial communities in captive and wild samples have great differences. "
"23","wild","Analysis of Differences between the CMD and WMD Gut Microbiota Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) demonstrated the difference in the gut microbiota between captive and wild forest musk deer (R = 0.745, p = 0.001; Figure 4). "
"24","wild","Each color of the grid in the middle heatmap represents the value of the OTU relative abundance in each row after normalization processing. genus level of the top 10 bacterial communities in captive and wild forest musk deer. "
"25","wild","In wild forest musk deer, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly higher than that in captive forest musk deer (P < 0.05). "
"26","wild","In contrast, the relative abundances of the Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia phyla in wild forest musk deer were significantly lower in captive forest musk deer (P < 0.05). "
"27","wild","At the genus level, the relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 in wild forest musk deer were significantly higher compared with captive forest musk deer (P < 0.05), while the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Prevotellaceae_UCG004 was lower in wild forest musk deer than in captive forest musk deer (P < 0.05). "
"28","wild","DISCUSSION This study is the first to employ 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology to compare differences in the gut microbiota between captive and wild forest musk deer. "
"29","wild","While, wild forest musk deer mainly consumed wild high-fiber plant leaves. "
"30","wild","Thus, differences of microbiota between captive and wild musk deer might be strongly associated with the dietary differences. "
"31","wild","The results of this study revealed that the core microbiota in captive and wild forest musk deer are mainly classified into the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla (Figure 7A). "
"32","wild","In this study, we found that the abundance of Firmicutes in the gut of wild forest musk deer was significantly higher than in captive forest musk deer. "
"33","wild","However, the abundance of Bacteroidetes in the gut of captive forest musk deer was significantly higher than in wild forest musk deer. "
"34","wild","In addition, similar core bacterial species between captive and wild forest musk deer at the genus level. "
"35","wild","Among these species, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus was at a relatively high level, and the amount of Ruminococcus in wild Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1705 fmicb-08-01705 September 2, 2017 Time: 15:7 # 8 Li et al. "
"36","wild","This result was consistent with the differences in feeding habits observed between wild and captive forest musk deer. "
"37","wild","In addition, In Figures 5, 6, we can see that almost all captive musk deer have Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium, which are mostly absent from wild musk deer. "
"38","wild","The α-diversity and gut microbiota composition did not show significant differences in captive and wild forest musk deer. "
"39","wild","In this study, the captive and wild forest musk deer were genetically similar, and the relative abundances of various microbiota may only have been affected by food, while the main microbiota composition was unchanged. "
"40","wild","For forest musk deer that live in the wild and can feed freely, their gut microbiotas have been formed through hundreds of years of long-term evolutionary processes and are in a relatively normal state. "
"41","wild","As far as possible, this will cause the gut microbiota in captive forest musk deer to return to a natural state similar to that observed in wild forest musk deer. "
"42","wild","This is significant for improving the health of captive forest musk deer and implementation of projects where captive forest musk deer are released into the wild. "
