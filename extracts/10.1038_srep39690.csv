"1","wild","However, little is known about how changes in the bacterial community may be involved in the manipulation of induced defenses in wild and cultivated Solanum plants of CPB. "
"2","wild","Here, we examined suppression of JA-mediated defense in wild and cultivated hosts of CPB by chemical elicitors and their symbiotic bacteria. "
"3","wild","In wild and cultivated Solanum species, JA is known to induce defensive secondary metabolites and proteins10â€“12. "
"4","wild","In this study, we hypothesized that the gut symbiotic bacteria of CPB varies by host plant and that the symbionts differentially suppress induced defenses in wild and cultivated Solanum host plants. "
"5","wild","To investigate whether wild and cultivated Solanum plants displayed antagonistic interactions between JA and SA, we sprayed MeJA, SA or both chemical elicitors on plants and measured PPO activity 48 h after treatment. "
"6","wild","CPB larvae can successfully use wild and cultivated Solanum plants in their natural environment. "
"7","wild","However, little is known about crosstalk between JA and SA in wild and cultivated Solanum plants. "
"8","wild","It is possible that the association of defense-suppressing bacteria with CPBs helped them adapt to a diverse range of Solanum host plants in wild and agricultural systems. "
"9","wild","To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the effect of negative crosstalk between JA and SA on induced defenses and resistance in wild Solanum host plants to CPB. "
"10","wild","We demonstrated that antagonistic interactions between JA and SA occurs in wild hosts of CPB and that bacteria associated with CPB larvae are also capable of suppressing defenses in these wild hosts. "
"11","fitness","Antagonistic interactions between JA and SA are often involved in fine-tuning plant defenses and reducing the fitness costs associated with inducible defenses2. "
"12","adaptat","Herbivore-associated bacteria could have played a role in adaptation to new hosts and host range expansion20,33,54. "
"13","adaptat","Host plant adaptations among geographic populations of the Colorado potato beetle. "
"14","adaptat","Gut bacteria facilitate adaptation to crop rotation in the western corn rootworm. "
"15","model","To investigate whether the abundance of defense-suppressing bacteria differs in response to diet, a generalized linear model with negative binomial errors was employed in R. "
"16","model","Bacterial communities of diverse Drosophila species: ecological context of a host-microbe model system. "
"17","environment","Colorado potato beetles (CPB; Leptinotarsa decemlineata) use several Solanum plants as hosts in their natural environment. "
"18","environment","CPB larvae can successfully use wild and cultivated Solanum plants in their natural environment. "
"19","environment","Further, the extent to which defenses are induced by herbivory can differ depending on plant species and environmental conditions such as light intensity, temperature, and nutrient availability52. "
"20","environment","Evolution of plant defenses in nonindigenous environments. "
"21","laboratory","Bacterial communities associated with the digestive tract of the predatory ground beetle, Poecilus chalcites, and their modification by laboratory rearing and antibiotic treatment. "
