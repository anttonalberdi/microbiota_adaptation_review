"15","wild","It is noteworthy that 40% (19 out of 47) of bacterial OTUs identified in the wild Z. cucurbitae could potentially belong to new families (2 out of 19), genera (5 out of 19) or species (12 out of 19), suggesting that there is a large portion of unexplored Microorganisms 2021, 9, 659 10 of 17 diversity in these populations.

"16","wild","This knowledge could prove useful, especially when we want to reconstruct the bacterial community of wild populations that have been introduced to the lab for massrearing purposes, in order to improve fitness and mating success. "
"17","wild","The process of colony adaptation typically results in the development of distinct bacterial communities between wild and laboratory populations, with laboratory populations usually experiencing a loss in diversity [10,19,48,49]. "
