"3","wild","We investigated variation in body temperature of wild barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, exposed to radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine and Belarus. "
"4","wild","These results highlight the complex ways that the body temperature of a wild bird is impacted by exposure to increased radioactive contamination in natural habitats. "
"5","wild","Here, we tested if exposure to radioactive contamination correlated with body temperature of wild barn swallows breeding in the Chernobyl area. "
"6","wild","To test these hypotheses, we analyzed a very large dataset (1,246 records) collected over 12 years for 13 colonies of wild barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, in an area encompassing low, medium, and highly contaminated regions of Ukraine and Belarus (Figure 1; Bonisoli Alquati et al., 2010).
