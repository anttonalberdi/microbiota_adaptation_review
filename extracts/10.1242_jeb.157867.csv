"1","wild","Benoit3 ABSTRACT Starvation is common among wild animal populations, and many individuals experience repeated bouts of starvation over the course of their lives. "
"2","wild","Most laboratory studies of starvation (including those done by the authors) lack an important component of biological realism by ignoring the fact that rather than seeing a single starvation event, wild animals often cycle through multiple periods of food limitation over the course of their lives (Carey et al., 2005; Ng’oma et al., 2017). "
"3","wild","While obesity is perhaps not a common problem among wild animals (but see Schilder and Marden, 2006), it is instructive to use humans who routinely fast themselves (e.g. so-called ‘yo-yo dieters’; sensu Prentice et al., 1992) as a starting point to generate hypotheses about which responses we might expect to see in other animals. "
"4","fitness","Each of these avenues is significant for understanding the adaptive role of starvation and nutrient deprivation on animal performance and fitness. "
"5","fitness","Moreover, consideration of multiple performance traits is required as it has implications for understanding niche evolution and fitness trade-offs, and consequently the evolution of starvation resistance in heterogeneous environments. "

"8","adaptation","Evolutionary versus physiological adaptation to starvation Given the ubiquity of food limitation among heterotrophs, both short-term responses through shifts in physiology and behavior and long-term evolutionary adaptations through natural selection are crucial to animal survival. "
"9","adaptation","Quantitative physiology of human starvation: adaptations of energy expenditure, macronutrient metabolism and body composition. "
"10","adaptation","Thermoregulatory adaptations to starvation in birds. "
"11","adaptation","Evolutionary adaptation to environmental stressors: a common response at the proteomic level. "
"12","adaptation","Metabolic rate depression and biochemical adaptation in anaerobiosis, hibernation and estivation. "
"13","model","Collectively, they could provide a basis for developing general hypotheses about how non-model organisms might respond to repeated exposure to food limitation – but there are no substitutes for direct observations. "
"14","model","The results of either destructive or non-destructive approaches can then be used to inform quantitative models about the timing and extent of macronutrient mobilization (sensu Caloin, 2004; Hall, 2012). "
