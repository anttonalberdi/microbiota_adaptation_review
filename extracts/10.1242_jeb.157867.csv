"1","wild","Benoit3 ABSTRACT Starvation is common among wild animal populations, and many individuals experience repeated bouts of starvation over the course of their lives. "
"2","wild","Most laboratory studies of starvation (including those done by the authors) lack an important component of biological realism by ignoring the fact that rather than seeing a single starvation event, wild animals often cycle through multiple periods of food limitation over the course of their lives (Carey et al., 2005; Ng’oma et al., 2017). "
"3","wild","While obesity is perhaps not a common problem among wild animals (but see Schilder and Marden, 2006), it is instructive to use humans who routinely fast themselves (e.g. so-called ‘yo-yo dieters’; sensu Prentice et al., 1992) as a starting point to generate hypotheses about which responses we might expect to see in other animals. "
"4","fitness","Each of these avenues is significant for understanding the adaptive role of starvation and nutrient deprivation on animal performance and fitness. "
"5","fitness","Moreover, consideration of multiple performance traits is required as it has implications for understanding niche evolution and fitness trade-offs, and consequently the evolution of starvation resistance in heterogeneous environments. "

"8","adaptat","Evolutionary versus physiological adaptation to starvation Given the ubiquity of food limitation among heterotrophs, both short-term responses through shifts in physiology and behavior and long-term evolutionary adaptations through natural selection are crucial to animal survival. "

"13","model","Collectively, they could provide a basis for developing general hypotheses about how non-model organisms might respond to repeated exposure to food limitation – but there are no substitutes for direct observations. "
"14","model","The results of either destructive or non-destructive approaches can then be used to inform quantitative models about the timing and extent of macronutrient mobilization (sensu Caloin, 2004; Hall, 2012). "

"16","model","Insulin induces a shift in lipid and primary carbonmetabolites in amodel of fastinginduced insulin resistance. "
"17","disease","The speed and metabolic cost of digesting a blood meal depends on temperature in a major disease vector. "
"18","environment","Starvation occurs when no food can be found (perhaps because there is none to be found, or foraging attempts are unsuccessful) or when environmental conditions (e.g. acute cold exposure or drought) prevent the physiological processes responsible for ingestion or digestion. "
"19","environment","Some ectotherms can do this through behavioral means by moving to a cooler environment (McCue, 2004; Bicego et al., 2007), but the greatest absolute energy savings during periods of food limitation could be realized by endotherms (Geiser, 1988). "
"20","environment","Importantly, revealing the dynamics between stress exposure and food limitation is crucial to understanding the impact of single or multiple starvation bouts under field conditions as food limitation is often accompanied by other environmental stressors (Olson et al., 2017). "
"21","environment","Moreover, consideration of multiple performance traits is required as it has implications for understanding niche evolution and fitness trade-offs, and consequently the evolution of starvation resistance in heterogeneous environments. "

"27","human","Several reviews summarize the responses that humans and other animals have to fasting and/or starvation itself (Keys et al., 1950; Castellini and Rea, 1992; Wang et al., 2006; McCue, 2010, 2012; Secor and Carey, 2016), but we know much less about the responses and mechanisms involved during the refeeding and recovery phases. "
"28","human","Specific examples of humans and other animals cycled through repeated bouts of fasting or food limitation suggest that these protective responses may be progressively enhanced with ‘practice’ (i.e. prior stress exposure). "
"29","human","Persistent reductions in RMR that are greater than expected from mass loss (absolute or fat-free) alone are documented in formerly obese humans (Rosenbaum et al., 2008; MacLean et al., 2011; Sumithran and Proietto, 2013). "
"30","human","While obesity is perhaps not a common problem among wild animals (but see Schilder and Marden, 2006), it is instructive to use humans who routinely fast themselves (e.g. so-called ‘yo-yo dieters’; sensu Prentice et al., 1992) as a starting point to generate hypotheses about which responses we might expect to see in other animals. "
"31","human","A study of formerly obese humans in the recovery phase showed reduced activities of enzymes involved in the glycerophosphate cycle, which is known to enhance heat production in the body (Bray, 1969). "
"32","human","A study of humans reports that the SDA response can even remain diminished for a year after mass loss (Rosenbaum et al., 2008). "

"37","laboratory","Although much information has been gained through laboratory studies of acute starvation, little is known about how starvation affects an animal once food is again available (i.e. during the refeeding and recovery phases). "
"38","laboratory","Most laboratory studies of starvation (including those done by the authors) lack an important component of biological realism by ignoring the fact that rather than seeing a single starvation event, wild animals often cycle through multiple periods of food limitation over the course of their lives (Carey et al., 2005; Ng’oma et al., 2017).
