"
"2","wild","Because it is extremely difficult to find bat fecal pellets in the wild and to avoid contamination, we used hoop nets to trap bats when they flew out of the caves at nightfall. "
"3","wild","In the wild, the preference for fermented fruit may cause that more fungi thus easily access the digestive tract of phytophagous bats than that of insectivorous bats. "
"4","adaptat","C. albicans is the major pathogenic Candida species and with pathogenic determinants and adaptation mechanism. "

"
"6","model","Thus, bats with diverse diets can be ideal animal models for further studies of those interactions in gut microbiota. "
"7","disease","Furthermore, the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans infection is responsible for the lethal white-nose syndrome, a disease that has dramatically reduced the bat populations in Europe and American countries [31]. "
"8","disease","This lethal disease has recently been detected in bats in northeast China [31], but it is unclear whether this pathogen has spread to South China. "

"11","environment","The increase in this genus may be explained by food source, and their capacity to survive fructose-rich intestinal environments of phytophagous bats. "
"12","environment","Thus, humans are more likely to live in environments that were contaminated by the pathogens from bats. "

"15","human","Most of these fungi are foodborne and are also pathogens of humans and other animals. "
"16","human","It is noteworthy that in several previous studies, some human and other animals morbific fungi (Candida albicans, etc) were also isolated from bat excreta [3, 9, 10]. "
"17","human","Most of Cladosporium species are usually phytopathogens, some of which were also later discovered to be human pathogens [41, 46, 67]. "
"18","human","Fungal Pathogens from Bats Of note, many fungi detected at higher levels in plant-feeding bat feces have been reported to be also human pathogens [3, 9, 10, 25, 50, 58, 66]. "
"19","human","G. candidum, except as a plant pathogen, can infect pulmonary, bronchopulmonary, cutaneous and oral site, and blood of the humans and result in geotrichosis or fungemia [3]. "
"20","human","More crucially, the reduction of natural habitats of bats gradually causes the overlapping of human and bat living areas [2, 7, 48]. "
