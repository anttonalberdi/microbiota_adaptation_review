"
"2","wild","Because it is extremely difficult to find bat fecal pellets in the wild and to avoid contamination, we used hoop nets to trap bats when they flew out of the caves at nightfall. "
"3","wild","In the wild, the preference for fermented fruit may cause that more fungi thus easily access the digestive tract of phytophagous bats than that of insectivorous bats. "
"4","adaptation","C. albicans is the major pathogenic Candida species and with pathogenic determinants and adaptation mechanism. "
