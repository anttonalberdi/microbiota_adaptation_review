"1","wild","Quantitative RTPCR analysis indicated that expression of Atg7 mRNA in the colon was diminished by 84% compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. "
"2","mutant","Therefore, it is unlikely that previous studies using these mutant mice could have clarified the role of autophagy in the colon, which is a major affected area in IBDs. "
"3","mutant","By using these mutant mice, we analyzed the function of autophagy in the maintenance of gut commensal microflora and protection against UC-like colitis. "
"4","model","Intestinal epithelium-specific Atg7 deficiency in VillinCre transgenic mice (22–24) showed enhanced susceptibility against Citrobacter rodentium infection (used as murine models of EHEC and EPEC infection) (25). "
"5","model","In this study, we took advantage of the specific Cre recombinase expression in colonic epithelial cells in a GlcNAc6ST-2-Cre transgenic mouse model (26) to delete Atg7 in a colonic epithelial cell-specific manner. "
"6","model","DSS-induced Colitis—In acute colitis model, mice were given 3% (w/v) DSS (molecular mass  36,000 –50,000 Da; MP Biomedicals) in their drinking water for 7 days, which was then replaced with normal water. "
"7","model","In the chronic colitis model, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (Sigma) in saline at day 7, followed by the three cycles of 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days and regular water for 14 days. "
"8","model","A, schematic overview of the azoxymethane/DSS chronic colitis model. "
"9","model","We found that the Atg7 cKO mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, an experimental model of UC (Figs. "
"10","model","We believe that the animal model described herein may be useful for the determination of bacterial subgroups involved in the onset of colitis. "
"11","model","(2006) Absence of bacterially induced RELM reduces injury in the dextran sodium sulfate model of colitis. "
"12","knockout","2 The abbreviations used are: IBD, inflammatory bowel diseases; CD, Crohn disease; UC, ulcerative colitis; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; DAI, disease activity index; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; cKO, conditional knockout; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; DAI, disease activity index.
