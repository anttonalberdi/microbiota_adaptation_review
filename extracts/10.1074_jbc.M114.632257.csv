"1","wild","Quantitative RTPCR analysis indicated that expression of Atg7 mRNA in the colon was diminished by 84% compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. "
"2","mutant","Therefore, it is unlikely that previous studies using these mutant mice could have clarified the role of autophagy in the colon, which is a major affected area in IBDs. "
"3","mutant","By using these mutant mice, we analyzed the function of autophagy in the maintenance of gut commensal microflora and protection against UC-like colitis. "
"4","model","Intestinal epithelium-specific Atg7 deficiency in VillinCre transgenic mice (22–24) showed enhanced susceptibility against Citrobacter rodentium infection (used as murine models of EHEC and EPEC infection) (25). "
"5","model","In this study, we took advantage of the specific Cre recombinase expression in colonic epithelial cells in a GlcNAc6ST-2-Cre transgenic mouse model (26) to delete Atg7 in a colonic epithelial cell-specific manner. "
"6","model","DSS-induced Colitis—In acute colitis model, mice were given 3% (w/v) DSS (molecular mass  36,000 –50,000 Da; MP Biomedicals) in their drinking water for 7 days, which was then replaced with normal water. "
"7","model","In the chronic colitis model, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (Sigma) in saline at day 7, followed by the three cycles of 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 days and regular water for 14 days. "
"8","model","A, schematic overview of the azoxymethane/DSS chronic colitis model. "
"9","model","We found that the Atg7 cKO mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, an experimental model of UC (Figs. "
"10","model","We believe that the animal model described herein may be useful for the determination of bacterial subgroups involved in the onset of colitis. "
"11","model","(2006) Absence of bacterially induced RELM reduces injury in the dextran sodium sulfate model of colitis. "
"12","knockout","2 The abbreviations used are: IBD, inflammatory bowel diseases; CD, Crohn disease; UC, ulcerative colitis; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; DAI, disease activity index; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; cKO, conditional knockout; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; DAI, disease activity index. "
"13","disease","Significance: These findings may ultimately lead to an efficient intervention for inflammatory bowel diseases. "
"14","disease","Genome-wide association studies of inflammatory bowel diseases identified susceptible loci containing an autophagy-related gene. "
"15","disease","However, the role of autophagy in the colon, a major affected area in inflammatory bowel diseases, is not clear. "
"16","disease","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs),2 including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic remittent or progressive inflammatory disorders in the gastrointestinal tract associated with an increased risk of colon cancer (1). "
"17","disease","2 The abbreviations used are: IBD, inflammatory bowel diseases; CD, Crohn disease; UC, ulcerative colitis; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; DAI, disease activity index; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; cKO, conditional knockout; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; DAI, disease activity index. "
"18","disease","The disease activity index (DAI) was determined according to the criteria described previously (29) with some modifications as follows: diarrhea score (0 point  normal stool, 1 point  soft stool, 2 points  very soft stool, and 3 points  watery stool); bleeding score (0 point  normal color stool, 1 point  brown color stool, 2 points  reddish color stool, and 3 points  bloody stool). "
"19","disease","Another possibility is that these bacteria may not be involved in the induction of the antibacterial or antiparasitic peptide genes and that minor bacterial species that we have not evaluated may have affected their expression, consistent with the keystone hypothesis, which states that keystone species with a low abundance in the bacterial community are considered to have a communitywide impact on health and disease (65).
