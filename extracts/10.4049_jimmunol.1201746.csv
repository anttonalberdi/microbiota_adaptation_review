"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","Abbreviations used in this article: EBF, epithelial barrier function; EC, epithelial cell; IEL, intraepithelial lymphocyte; LP, lamina propria; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear Ag; PN, parenteral nutrition; TER, transepithelial resistance; TPN, total parenteral nutrition; Treg, regulatory T cell; T-RFLP, terminal RFLP; WT, wild-type. "
"2","wild","In particular, we show increased macrophage TLR4 signaling, a loss of LP regulatory T cells (Tregs), and a proinflammatory cytokine response in the LP macrophages in wild-type (WT) mice. "
"3","fitness","This is especially relevant because such EC phenotype changes affect the local environment for the mucosally associated bacteria, and mucosal glycan foraging ability is directly linked to bacterial fitness within the human gut microbial community (40). "
"4","fitness","Mucosal glycan foraging enhances fitness and transmission of a saccharolytic human gut bacterial symbiont. "
"5","model","Previous studies from our laboratory and others have shown that in a mouse model of total PN (TPN) there are a number of significant physical and immunologic changes in the intestinal mucosa (5). "
"6","model","These findings have been shown in mouse models and in humans (11) on PN. "
"7","model","TPN model Mice were used between 10 and 14 wk of age. "
"8","model","These data also strongly suggest that the proinflammatory signals in our TPN model are primarily derived from the LP F4/80+CD11b+ CD11cdull/2 macrophages. "
"9","model","The Journal of Immunology 6611 by guest on January 11, 2022 http://w w w .jim m unol.org/ D ow nloaded from MyD882/2 mice baseline characteristics To examine the role of TLR signaling in our model, we proceeded to study the mucosal immune response in MyD882/2 mice. "
"10","model","6612 SMALL BOWEL MICROBIOTA AND MyD88-DEPENDENT INFLAMMATION by guest on January 11, 2022 http://w w w .jim m unol.org/ D ow nloaded from EBF and EC proliferation loss are significantly prevented in MyD882/2 mice As we have previously reported a loss of jejunal and ileal EBF in our TPN mouse model (8, 9, 34), we next examined whether there were any physiologic effects of knocking out the MyD88 signaling pathway. "
"11","model","Changes in TLR expression at the whole intestinal level have been described in a mouse TPN model (36). "
"12","model","Work by Dahan et al. (12) showed that EC phenotype can be markedly affected by LP cells, and this suggests that examining signaling changes in the LP may provide mechanistic insight into known EC changes in our TPN model. "
"13","model","Our model offers a unique method FIGURE 5. "
"14","model","Although the animal model and duration of enteral nutrient deprivation are very different, a Burmese python model of enteral nutrient deprivation and refeeding showed significant shifts from Bacteroidetes, which were dominant in the fasting state, whereas Firmicutes established themselves during a fed state (38). "
"15","model","Although beyond the scope of this study, whether the prevention of loss of EC proliferation in the MyD882/2 mouse model is due to a single TLR pathway is a very important question. "
"16","model","However, it is unknownwhether the TPNmicrobiota produces polysaccharide A, and the Treg changes may be driven more by the local TGF-b levels (43) (which were decreased in the TPN model; Fig. "
"17","model","In our TPN model, the proinflammatory phenotype in the LP macrophages is abated when the MyD88 signaling pathway is blocked. "
"18","model","One is that the intestinal macrophages in the TPN model may consist of newly recruited macrophages that still possess the ability to respond in a proinflammatory manner. "
"19","model","Although their model knocks out both MyD88-dependent and -independent TLR signaling and has different injury mechanisms, the protection of EBF in the knockouts is consistent with our results. "
"20","model","Studies with gnotobiotic or single-strain colonized mice, such as in the Atarashi et al. (43) and Slack et al. (47) studies, and/or bone marrow chimeras between WT and MyD882/2 mice would be necessary to more conclusively prove this relationship and to further clarify the role of the LP versus the epithelium in the TPN model, but these factors are beyond the scope of this study.

"30","knockout","Data from our laboratory have shown that TNF-a receptor-1 and -2 double-knockout mice have retained EC proliferation after TPN administration (41), indicating that reduced levels of TNF-a expression in the MyD882/2 mice may be responsible for their preserved proliferative capacity. "

"32","knockout","Although their model knocks out both MyD88-dependent and -independent TLR signaling and has different injury mechanisms, the protection of EBF in the knockouts is consistent with our results. "
