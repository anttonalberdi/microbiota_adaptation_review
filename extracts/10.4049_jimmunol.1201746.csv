"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","Abbreviations used in this article: EBF, epithelial barrier function; EC, epithelial cell; IEL, intraepithelial lymphocyte; LP, lamina propria; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear Ag; PN, parenteral nutrition; TER, transepithelial resistance; TPN, total parenteral nutrition; Treg, regulatory T cell; T-RFLP, terminal RFLP; WT, wild-type. "
"2","wild","In particular, we show increased macrophage TLR4 signaling, a loss of LP regulatory T cells (Tregs), and a proinflammatory cytokine response in the LP macrophages in wild-type (WT) mice. "
"3","fitness","This is especially relevant because such EC phenotype changes affect the local environment for the mucosally associated bacteria, and mucosal glycan foraging ability is directly linked to bacterial fitness within the human gut microbial community (40). "
"4","fitness","Mucosal glycan foraging enhances fitness and transmission of a saccharolytic human gut bacterial symbiont. "
