"3","wild","Abstract Aim: This study aimed to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in wild Sumatran orangutans to provide more information about LAB diversity derived from Sumatran orangutan feces. "
"4","wild","Materials and Methods: Fecal sampling from three female orangutans, around 35 years old, was carried out in the wild forest areas at the research station of Suaq Belimbing Gunung Leuser National Park located in the South Aceh district. "
"5","wild","Conclusion: These results show that there is a difference in identification between biochemical testing with API kits and molecular analyses on LAB isolates from wild Sumatran orangutans. "
"6","wild","Based on 16S rRNA gene homology, the OUL4 LAB isolates from wild Sumatran orangutans have 93% homology to W. cibaria. "
"7","wild","LAB from wild orangutans could likely be used as a probiotic to stabilize the gut and suppress the growth and colonization of bacterial enteropathogens when introduced into semi-wild usually undergoes a rehabilitation orangutans process before release back into the wild. "
"8","wild","LAB research on wild Sumatran orangutans is still rare. "
"9","wild","Therefore, this study aims to isolate and identify LAB from wild Sumatran orangutans to provide more information about LAB diversity derived from their feces. "
"10","wild","This study identified LAB originating from wild orangutan feces, which can potentially be used as probiotics to maintain the balance of normal intestinal flora in semi-wild orangutans that will be released back into nature. "
"11","wild","Orangutans, who roam freely in this forest, live naturally without human intervention, in health management, food, vaccination, and the provision of worm medicine; fecal orangutan sampling was carried out in wild forest areas. "
"12","wild","The sample materials used in this study were isolates of LAB from wild Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii) feces at the Suaq Belimbing South Aceh research station. "
