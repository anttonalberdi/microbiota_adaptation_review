"1","wild","Results Doxorubicin induces time-dependent damage of the small intestine in wild-type mice Intestinal morphology was examined to evaluate the influence of doxorubicin on mucositis development. "
"2","model","This study aimed to define the role of TLR-2 and TLR-9 in the modulation of small intestinal damage in a model of doxorubicin-induced mucositis. "
"3","model","However, a five-step model formulated by Sonis [4,5] describes an initiation phase of cell injury and NF-κB activation, followed by induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which then cause tissue inflammation [6,7] and further cell apoptosis. "
"4","model","It has been shown that TLRs could modulate cell death in several model systems [23–25] and that apoptosis precedes intestinal hypoplasia in patients [26]; we therefore hypothesize that TLRs might play a role in the initiation phase of MBI development, not only in the later stages as proposed by Sonis [4]. "
"5","model","To address this question, we employed a doxorubicininduced murine mucositis model to investigate whether TLRs are required for the development of mucositis. "
"6","model","In addition, we show that the pro-survival effect of TLR-2 deficiency in this model is correlated with inhibition of GSK-3β activity. "
"7","model","In the present study, we used a mouse model of doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis to show for the first time that TLR-2 or TLR-9 deficiency significantly ameliorates the signs of ileitis caused by drug administration. "
"8","model","A harmful role of TLRs has been shown in other models of intestinal damage. "
"9","model","For example, it has been shown in the model of Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a major GIT complication after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, that TLR9−/− mice had reduced intestinal damage and increased survival [35,36]. "
"10","model","The discrepancies between these studies might be explained by the different models used and the organs studied (DSS-induced colitis versus doxorubicin-induced ileitis) and by the diversity of TLR expression along the GIT [14,43]. "
"11","model","A possible explanation for the amelioration of MBI severity in our model is that absence of TLR-2 or TLR9 decreases doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in intestinal crypts (Figures 5A and 5B). "
"12","model","Therefore, in contrast to the model proposed by Sonis [4,5], our findings suggest a role for TLRs in protecting epithelial cells from the apoptosis induced by cytotoxic therapy before bacterial translocation and intestinal ulceration occur. "
"13","model","In our model of mucositis, inhibition of GSK3β reduced the rate of apoptosis and the severity of intestinal damage (Figures 6A and 6B), which is in agreement with a previous observation that GSK-3 Copyright © 2011 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. "
"14","model","However, modulation of the cell death or survival decision by GSK-3β is complex, and the decision to switch on apoptotic or survival mechanisms could be different in other model systems [21]. "
"15","model","It has been shown that oral or intraperitoneal administration of inhibitory adenoviral ODN decreases inflammation in DSS-induced colitis and in a model of severe combined immunodeficiency colitis [50,51]. "
"16","model","TLR-2 and TLR-9 are sensors of apoptosis in a mouse model of doxorubicin-induced acute inflammation. "
"17","model","MyD88/TLR9 mediated immunopathology and gut microbiota dynamics in a novel murine model of intestinal graft-versus-host disease. "
"18","model","An agonist of toll-like receptor 5 has radioprotective activity in mouse and primate models. "
"19","model","In vivo CpG DNA/toll-like receptor 9 interaction induces regulatory properties in CD4+CD62L+ T cells which prevent intestinal inflammation in the SCID transfer model of colitis. "
"20","knockout","We used TLR-2−/− and TLR-9−/− single knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background. "
"21","knockout","Absence of TLR-2 or TLR-9 signalling protects from doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis We previously showed that TLR-2 and TLR-9 knockout mice have reduced signs of doxorubicin-induced acute peritonitis [32], but we did not investigate intestinal damage in these mice. "
"22","knockout","Here, we investigated the status of inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β in WT and TLR-2 or TLR-9 knockout mice in doxorubicininduced intestinal mucositis. "
"23","disease","It also dictates dose reduction in the subsequent chemotherapy cycle, which slows or hinders cure of the disease [2,3]. "

"25","disease","Despite the beneficial role of PRRs, deregulation of TLR signalling is also associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and gastrointestinal cancer [18]. "
"26","disease","GSK-3 regulates multiple transcription factors important in inflammation and cytokine production [20], as well as cell cycle progression and apoptosis [21], and contributes to the pathogenesis of several diseases, including chronic colitis [22]. "
