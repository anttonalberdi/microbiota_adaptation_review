"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","In this study, we used a culture-based approach, in combination with a population analysis based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, to describe changes in the faecal microbiota of wild-caught snails that were fed a nonsterile plant diet over a period of 21 days. "
"2","wild","At the beginning of the experiment, wild-caught snails harboured diverse populations of Gammaproteobacteria. "
"3","wild","Buttiauxella had previously been characterized from nearly 170 unidentified wild-caught snails and slugs from around the world (Muller et al., 1996). "
"4","wild","In our study, we examined the gut microbiota of wildcaught snails fed a nonsterile plant diet while challenging them with penicillin, in order to track changes in the faecal microbiota over time. "
"5","wild","RESULTS Bacterial populations in the faeces of wild-caught Cornu aspersum Eight wild-caught snails were collected from a single home garden in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. "
"6","wild","Parallel population studies using 16S rRNA amplicon sequence were performed on the faecal homogenates obtained over time from five wild-caught snails (C1, P1, P2, P4 and P6). "
"7","wild","Relative abundance of total MacConkey-selected bacterial groups (A) and the ten most abundant bacterial groups obtained via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (B) retrieved from wild-caught snail faeces following a 24-h fast (day 1) and over time (days 2–21). "
"8","wild","Population analysis during antibiotic treatment and recovery Both culture-based and 16S rRNA gene-based population analyses showed that wild-caught snails harboured bacteria from multiple Gammaproteobacteria orders prior to penicillin treatment. "
"9","wild","As our aim was to study the microbial populations within individual snails over time, we analysed the faecal microbiota from wild-caught snails. "
"10","wild","First, we found that Buttiauxella was present in all wild-caught snail faecal samples. "
"11","wild","Using combined culture-based and 16S rRNA gene approaches, Buttiauxella was present in all wild-caught snail faecal samples, was maintained in controls throughout the experiment and re-emerged (following Pseudomonas takeover) in all penicillin-treated snails. "
"12","wild","While Pseudomonas are typically not associated with healthy human microbiomes, they have been observed at high abundance in the gut of wild-caught zebrafish (Roeselers et al., 2011) and the coffee-boring beetle Hypothenemus hampei, where they likely play a role in caffeine breakdown (Ceja-Navarro et al., 2015). "
"13","wild","The fact that Buttiauxella abundance did not fully return to wild-caught levels in treatment snails and was reduced even in control snails fed Buttiauxella-lacking lettuce suggests that exposure to exogenous faecal microbes may be necessary to maintain the gut microbiota of C. aspersum. "
"14","model","Transcriptome analysis in aestivating C. aspersum has effectively shown both the promise of this interesting animal model and the challenges faced when annotating transcriptomes in this understudied group of organisms (Parmakelis et al., 2017). "
"15","model","Microbial successions are associated with changes in chemical profiles of a model refrigerated fresh pork sausage during an 80-day shelf life study. "
