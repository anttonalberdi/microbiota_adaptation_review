"1","wild","In this study, we used a culture-based approach, in combination with a population analysis based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, to describe changes in the faecal microbiota of wild-caught snails that were fed a nonsterile plant diet over a period of 21 days. "
"2","wild","At the beginning of the experiment, wild-caught snails harboured diverse populations of Gammaproteobacteria. "
"3","wild","Buttiauxella had previously been characterized from nearly 170 unidentified wild-caught snails and slugs from around the world (Muller et al., 1996). "
"4","wild","In our study, we examined the gut microbiota of wildcaught snails fed a nonsterile plant diet while challenging them with penicillin, in order to track changes in the faecal microbiota over time. "
"5","wild","RESULTS Bacterial populations in the faeces of wild-caught Cornu aspersum Eight wild-caught snails were collected from a single home garden in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. "
"6","wild","Parallel population studies using 16S rRNA amplicon sequence were performed on the faecal homogenates obtained over time from five wild-caught snails (C1, P1, P2, P4 and P6). "
"7","wild","Relative abundance of total MacConkey-selected bacterial groups (A) and the ten most abundant bacterial groups obtained via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (B) retrieved from wild-caught snail faeces following a 24-h fast (day 1) and over time (days 2–21). "
"8","wild","Population analysis during antibiotic treatment and recovery Both culture-based and 16S rRNA gene-based population analyses showed that wild-caught snails harboured bacteria from multiple Gammaproteobacteria orders prior to penicillin treatment. "
"9","wild","As our aim was to study the microbial populations within individual snails over time, we analysed the faecal microbiota from wild-caught snails. "
"10","wild","First, we found that Buttiauxella was present in all wild-caught snail faecal samples. "
"11","wild","Using combined culture-based and 16S rRNA gene approaches, Buttiauxella was present in all wild-caught snail faecal samples, was maintained in controls throughout the experiment and re-emerged (following Pseudomonas takeover) in all penicillin-treated snails. "
"12","wild","While Pseudomonas are typically not associated with healthy human microbiomes, they have been observed at high abundance in the gut of wild-caught zebrafish (Roeselers et al., 2011) and the coffee-boring beetle Hypothenemus hampei, where they likely play a role in caffeine breakdown (Ceja-Navarro et al., 2015). "
"13","wild","The fact that Buttiauxella abundance did not fully return to wild-caught levels in treatment snails and was reduced even in control snails fed Buttiauxella-lacking lettuce suggests that exposure to exogenous faecal microbes may be necessary to maintain the gut microbiota of C. aspersum. "
"14","model","Transcriptome analysis in aestivating C. aspersum has effectively shown both the promise of this interesting animal model and the challenges faced when annotating transcriptomes in this understudied group of organisms (Parmakelis et al., 2017). "
"15","model","Microbial successions are associated with changes in chemical profiles of a model refrigerated fresh pork sausage during an 80-day shelf life study. "
"16","disease","Buttiauxella has also been retrieved from contaminated or decomposing food (Ercolini et al., 2009; He et al., 2009; Mace et al., 2012; Sade, Murros & Bjorkroth, 2013; Benson et al., 2014; Castelo-Branco et al., 2016; Masiello et al., 2016), surface water (Jothikumar et al., 2014), bird faeces (Agnew et al., 2015; Murugaiyan et al., 2015), gall midge guts (Bansal et al., 2014) and human disease samples (Antonello et al., 2014; De Baere et al., 2002). "
"17","environment","Due to its macroscopic size, slow dispersal rate, habit of consuming soil and the relative ease with which it can be marked and tracked over time, C. aspersum has been used to study environmental pollution (Beeby & Richmond, 2003; Regoli et al., 2006; de Vaufleury et al., 2006; Angeletti et al., 2013). "
"18","environment","We chose this regime because we ultimately hope to compare faecal microbiota profiles from isolates of C. aspersum from different locations in Oregon to determine whether environmental conditions, particularly antibiotics, affect microbiome composition. "
"19","environment","In this respect, efforts to investigate whether environments like soil and water represent thriving reservoirs for this genus, or whether such habitats are contaminated by host-endemic microbiome material, are of particular importance. "
"20","environment","In the study by Blum et al. (2013), the incubation regime allowed developing flies to inoculate the sterile food source with faeces for 3 days prior to the flies passing into a new sterile environment and with a new sterile food source; this resulted in the development of a more stable gut microbiome population over time. "
"21","environment","In contrast, our feeding regime involved passing individual snails into a new sterile environment every 24 h. "
"22","environment","We hypothesize that these conditional microbiome changes may be used to compare faecal microbiota profiles from isolates of C. aspersum from different locations to determine whether environmental conditions, specifically antibiotics, affect microbiome composition. "
"23","environment","Although environmental antibiotics are recognized as a potential source for antibiotic resistance, few studies have addressed their impact on complex natural populations (Andersson & Hughes, 2014). "
"24","environment","Given this observation, we hypothesize that the distribution of snails and their faecal microbiome population profiles for the Willamette Valley may reflect the relative amount of antibiotics in the environment, with Pseudomonas being favoured where antibiotic concentrations are higher.

"26","human","Buttiauxella has also been retrieved from contaminated or decomposing food (Ercolini et al., 2009; He et al., 2009; Mace et al., 2012; Sade, Murros & Bjorkroth, 2013; Benson et al., 2014; Castelo-Branco et al., 2016; Masiello et al., 2016), surface water (Jothikumar et al., 2014), bird faeces (Agnew et al., 2015; Murugaiyan et al., 2015), gall midge guts (Bansal et al., 2014) and human disease samples (Antonello et al., 2014; De Baere et al., 2002). "
"27","human","In human cystic-f ibrosis patients, for example, opportunistic soil-borne Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominates lung microbial communities as patients age, reflecting the cumulative exposure to antibiotics (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, 2016). "
"28","human","While Pseudomonas are typically not associated with healthy human microbiomes, they have been observed at high abundance in the gut of wild-caught zebrafish (Roeselers et al., 2011) and the coffee-boring beetle Hypothenemus hampei, where they likely play a role in caffeine breakdown (Ceja-Navarro et al., 2015). "
"29","human","Although using faeces represents a potential limitation, the approach of analysing microbiome changes over time is the only ethical option in some systems (e.g. humans). "
