"1","wild","Compared to untreated mice, CLA-treated mice showed increased gut colonization by wild-type Salmonella, as well as increased dissemination to the spleen. "
"2","wild","To examine the effect of LCUFAs on Salmonella infection, we determined bacterial loads in the cecum content of streptomycin pretreated mice that were orally infected with either wild-type or phoP mutant S. "
"3","wild","At 24 hpi, cecal bacterial loads [colony-forming unit (CFU)/g] showed no difference between ds-CLA– or PBS-treated mice infected with either the wild-type or the phoP strain, whereas bacterial counts in spleens were below the level of detection irrespective of treatment. "
"4","wild","At 72 hpi, ds-CLA–treated mice showed increased bacterial loads for the wild-type strain in cecum compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. "
"5","wild","Irrespective of treatment, the phoP strain also showed moderately increased loads in cecum when compared to wild-type strain in PBS-treated mice. "
"6","wild","The fact that CLA-treatment did not affect the phoP strain as it did with the wild-type strain indicated that the effect could not be attributed to the higher availability of fatty acids as Salmonella nutrients. "
"7","wild","In parallel, at 72 hours, the wild-type strain reached significantly higher loads in spleens of CLA-treated mice when compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. "
"8","wild","Consistent with the reported intramacrophage survival impairment and inability to reach the spleen of the phoP mutant (29, 30), bacterial loads of the phoP strain were significantly lower than the wild-type strain in the spleens of either PBS-treated or ds-CLA–treated mice (Fig. "
"9","wild","Signal. 13, eaaz3334 (2020) 21 April 2020 S C I E N C E S I G N A L I N G | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 5 of 9 administration of CLA provoked a mild but consistent increase in the capacity of wild-type Salmonella to colonize the cecum, which was also observed for the phoP mutant strain. "
"10","wild","This correlated with statistically significantly enhanced colonization of the spleen by wild-type Salmonella in CLA-treated mice. "
"11","wild","These observations are in agreement with our in vitro LCUFA-mediated PhoP/PhoQ repression results and allow us to conclude that the interaction of CLA with orally acquired Salmonella would suffice for the wild-type strain to behave similarly to the phoP strain during the early steps of infection. "
"12","wild","C57BL/6 mice were infected with ~1 × 108 CFU of wild-type or phoP mutant S. "
"13","wild","Data shown are means and SEs from n = 11 animals per group for the wild-type (WT) strain and n = 5 animals per group for the phoP mutant strain. "
"14","wild","Signal. 13, eaaz3334 (2020) 21 April 2020 S C I E N C E S I G N A L I N G | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 6 of 9 the inflammatory response generated at the gut (35, 36), we can conjecture that in ds-CLA–treated mice, an increased inflammatory response would provide wild-type Salmonella a colonization advantage. "
"15","wild","Within host cells, only the wild-type strain would be able to reprogram its PhoP/PhoQ-dependent expression pattern to survive inside phagocytic cells and disseminate to other organs, such as the spleen. "
"16","wild","Effect of LCUFAs on Salmonella growth The potential inhibitory effect of fatty acids was evaluated by growing Salmonella Typhimurium wild-type strain in LB in sterile 96-well microtiter plates, as described in (13, 43). "
"17","wild","Groups of 11 (for the wild-type strain) and 5 (for the phoP mutant) of 8to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (provided by the National Division of Veterinary Laboratories, Uruguay) were treated with 50 mg (72 l) of ds-CLA or the same volume of PBS per oral gavage at 24-hour intervals. "
