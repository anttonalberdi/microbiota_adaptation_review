"1","wild","Compared to untreated mice, CLA-treated mice showed increased gut colonization by wild-type Salmonella, as well as increased dissemination to the spleen. "
"2","wild","To examine the effect of LCUFAs on Salmonella infection, we determined bacterial loads in the cecum content of streptomycin pretreated mice that were orally infected with either wild-type or phoP mutant S. "
"3","wild","At 24 hpi, cecal bacterial loads [colony-forming unit (CFU)/g] showed no difference between ds-CLA– or PBS-treated mice infected with either the wild-type or the phoP strain, whereas bacterial counts in spleens were below the level of detection irrespective of treatment. "
"4","wild","At 72 hpi, ds-CLA–treated mice showed increased bacterial loads for the wild-type strain in cecum compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. "
"5","wild","Irrespective of treatment, the phoP strain also showed moderately increased loads in cecum when compared to wild-type strain in PBS-treated mice. "
"6","wild","The fact that CLA-treatment did not affect the phoP strain as it did with the wild-type strain indicated that the effect could not be attributed to the higher availability of fatty acids as Salmonella nutrients. "
"7","wild","In parallel, at 72 hours, the wild-type strain reached significantly higher loads in spleens of CLA-treated mice when compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. "
"8","wild","Consistent with the reported intramacrophage survival impairment and inability to reach the spleen of the phoP mutant (29, 30), bacterial loads of the phoP strain were significantly lower than the wild-type strain in the spleens of either PBS-treated or ds-CLA–treated mice (Fig. "

"
"10","wild","This correlated with statistically significantly enhanced colonization of the spleen by wild-type Salmonella in CLA-treated mice. "
"11","wild","These observations are in agreement with our in vitro LCUFA-mediated PhoP/PhoQ repression results and allow us to conclude that the interaction of CLA with orally acquired Salmonella would suffice for the wild-type strain to behave similarly to the phoP strain during the early steps of infection. "

"
"15","wild","Within host cells, only the wild-type strain would be able to reprogram its PhoP/PhoQ-dependent expression pattern to survive inside phagocytic cells and disseminate to other organs, such as the spleen. "
"16","wild","Effect of LCUFAs on Salmonella growth The potential inhibitory effect of fatty acids was evaluated by growing Salmonella Typhimurium wild-type strain in LB in sterile 96-well microtiter plates, as described in (13, 43). "

"24","mutant","It has been established that phoP mutant strains fail to cause disease in susceptible hosts. "
"25","mutant","The phoP mutant strains are unable to either carry out the bacterial surface modifications that reduce the immunostimulatory capacity of their LPS or decrease the expression of critical antigens, such as the flagellar structural component FliC, which is recognized by Toll-like receptors in epithelial and phagocytic cells and by specific receptors in T cells (34).
