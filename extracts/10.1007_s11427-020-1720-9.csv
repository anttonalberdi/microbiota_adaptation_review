"1","wild","Using a T cell transfer colitis model, we found that MAP3K2-deficient naïve CD4+ T cells had a dramatically reduced ability to induce colitis compared to wild type T cells. "
"2","wild","In addition, significantly fewer IFN-γbut more IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells in the intestines of mice receiving MAP3K2deficient T cells than in those from mice receiving wild type T cells was observed. "
"3","wild","To confirm T cell-specific deletion of theMap3k2 gene in these mice, we sorted CD4+ T cells from the spleens of wild type controlMap3k2fl/flmice and Cd4Cre: Map3k2fl/flmice for PCR genotyping analyses. "
"4","wild","As shown in Figure S1D in Supporting Information, recombination of the Map3k2 allele (Δflox allele) occurred only in CD4+ T cells from Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/flmice but not in CD4+ T cells from control mice or in B cells from either wild type mice or Cd4Cre:Map3k2fl/fl mice (Figure S1D in Supporting Information). "
"5","wild","Fifteen to twenty days after naïve CD4+ T cell transfer, mice that received control wild typeMap3k2fl/fl naïve T cells began to show weight loss, while mice that received similar numbers of naïveMap3k2-KO T cells had almost no loss of body weight, and this became more obvious 4 weeks after T cell transfer (Figure 1B). "
"6","wild","Mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells exhibited much less epithelial damage and fewer leukocyte infiltration in both the ileum and colon than those receiving wild type T cells (Figure 1C). "
"7","wild","Consistently, the overall histological scores of intestinal tissues in the mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells were also lower than those in mice receiving wild type T cells (Figure 1D). "
"8","wild","Furthermore, the expression of inflammatory genes Il6, Tnf, and Il1b in the ileum and colon of the mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells was also lower than that in the mice receiving wild type T cells (Figure 1E). "
"9","wild","On the other hand, Il18 expression was the same in the ileum and colon of mice receiving either wild type naïve or Map3k2-KO T cells (Figure 1E). "
"10","wild","To investigate these possibilities, we first determined the number of CD4+ T cells in the mLN and colon, and found that the total CD4+ T cell number was comparable in the mLN and colon of mice receiving wild type orMap3k2-KO Tcells at day 35 after T cell transfer (Figure 2A). "
"11","wild","We next examined the proliferation of wild type and Map3k2-KO CD4+ T cells by measuring the frequencies of Ki67+ CD4+ T cells among total CD4+ T cells, and we found the same percentage of Ki67+ CD4+ T cells in mLN and colon of mice receiving either wild type or Map3k2-KO T cells (Figure 2B and C). "
"12","wild","To assess the migration potential of wild type CD4+ T cells and Map3k2-KO CD4+ T cells, we mixed tdTomato+ (wild type) CD4+ T cells sorted from a mTmG mouse (Muzumdar et al., 2007) with CD4+ T cells from Map3k2-KO mice at roughly 1:1 ratio. "
"13","wild","After 24 h, the ratio of wild type tdTomato+ and Map3k2-KO CD4+ T cells in mLN and colons were determined by flow cytometry, and the ratio maintained the same as that before they were transferred (Figure S3A and B in Supporting Information). "
"14","wild","To investigate this possibility, we determined the frequencies of IFN-γ+ producing CD4+ T cells and IL-17A+ producing CD4+ T cells in the mLN and colon of mice receiving either naïve wild type or Map3k2KO T cells by flow cytometry. "
"15","wild","As shown in Figure 2D and E, the frequency of CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes of mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells was significantly lower than that in mice receiving wild type T cells (14.2% versus 30.0%). "
"16","wild","A more striking reduction in Th1 cells was found in lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) from the colon of mice receivingMap3k2-KO Tcells than in those of mice receiving wild type T cells (12.9% versus 42.1%) (Figure 2D and E). "
"17","wild","Interestingly, the number of CD4+IL17A+ T cells was elevated in both mLN and LPLs in mice receiving Map3k2-KO T cells compared to those in mice receiving wild type T cells (Figure 2D and E). "
"18","wild","Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 the Ifng level in the ileum and colon of mice receiving Map3k2-KO Tcells was also reduced compared to that in the mice receiving wild type T cells, whereas the Il17a level was increased (Figure 2F). "
"19","wild","Blue arrows show the leukocyte infiltration in wild type T cell recipient mice. "
"20","wild","Under the welldefined Th1 differentiation condition, naïve wild type and Map3k2-KO T cells had similar Th1 differentiation as exFigure 2 MAP3K2 promotes Th1 cells and inhibits Th17 cells during intestinal inflammation. "
"21","wild","Sci China Life Sci March (2021) Vol.64 No.3 pected, while the addition of IL-1β, H2O2, TNF-α, LPS, Pam3CSK4, or TGF-β had similar effects on control wild type Map3k2fl/fl T cells and Map3k2-KO T cells in terms of their ability to generate Th1 cells (Figure 3A and B). "
"22","wild","To our surprise, in vitro Th1 differentiation was significantly increased by the addition of IL-18 to wild type CD4 cells (18.0% to 28.4%), but this augmented Th1 differentiation by IL-18 was not observed in Map3k2-KO T cells (17.4% to 20.6%) (Figure 3C and D). "
"23","wild","Consistently, IL-18 augmented Tbx21 (T-bet) expression in wild type differentiated Th1 cells but not inMap3k2-KO Th1 cells under the same in vitro differentiation condition (Figure 3E). "
"24","wild","To determine which downstream MAPKs may be involved inMap3k2-mediated IL-18 signaling in Th1 cell differentiation, wild type and Map3k2KO CD4+ T cells were stimulated with IL-18, and MAPK activities were determined at different time points by immunoblotting. "
"25","wild","In wild type T cells, IL-18 was able to induce significant JNK activation and, to a lesser extent, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation. "
"26","wild","Although T cellspecific deletion of MAP3K2 did not affect thymic and peripheral T cell development and differentiation in vivo or effector T cell differentiation in vitro, differentiation of Map3k2-KO naïve T cells in the intestine of Rag2−/− mice was significantly impaired, and compared with mice receiving wild type naïve T cells, mice receiving Map3k2-KO naïve T cells had fewer IFN-γbut more IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria of the intestine and much milder colitis. "
"27","wild","Although the Rag2−/− mice receivingMap3k2KO naïve T cells developed more Th17 effector cells than those mice receiving wild type naïve T cells, we showed that IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells but not IL-17A-expressing Th17 cells were responsible for the observed severity of colitis. "
"28","wild","The data shown are normalized to the Tubulin expression level and the expression of phosphorylated JNK in untreated wild type T cells (0 min) is set to 1.0. "
"29","wild","In addition, we also examined the effect of IL-18 on Th17 differentiation in wildtype and MAP3K2 deficient CD4+ T cells, and found IL-18 similarly affected wild type and Map3k2-KO Th17 cell differentiation (Figure S4A and B in Supporting Information). "
"30","model","Using a T cell transfer colitis model, we found that MAP3K2-deficient naïve CD4+ T cells had a dramatically reduced ability to induce colitis compared to wild type T cells. "
"31","model","In a TNBS-induced mouse colitis model, blockade of endogenous IL-18 ameliorated the symptoms of colitis by decreasing local TNF-α production (Ten Hove et al., 2001). "
"32","model","However, using a T cell transfer mouse colitis model, we showed that MAP3K2 is required for T cell-mediated colitis, in which it facilitates Th1 cell differentiation. "
"33","model","Therefore, we investigated the in vivo role of MAP3K2 in T cells in regulating intestinal inflammation using a well-established naïve CD4+ T cell transfer colitis mouse model for IBD (Kiesler et al., 2015; Powrie et al., 1994). "
"34","model","We again used the naïve T cell transfer colitis model with an anti-IL-17A neutralizing antibody (10 µg per mouse) or an isotype matched control antibody (10 µg per mouse) that was administered every 5 days beginning on the first day ofMap3k2-KO naïve T cell transfer. "
"35","model","Interestingly, in addition to the Tcell transfer colitis model, we also used a DSS-induced colitis model to test T cellspecific roles in IBD development but found that similar 396 Wu, N., et al. "
