"1","wild","We observed significant changes in the abundance of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, in particular the Lachnospiraceae, Porphyromonodaceae and Prevotellacea families, when comparing Casp-1, -7 and -3 knockout mice with wild-type mice. "

"
"3","wild","Results and Discussion General characteristics of the microbiomes of Casp-KO and -wild-type (WT) mice. "
"4","model","In vivo experimental models of infection have demonstrated that Casp-1-knockout (KO) mice are more susceptible to a variety of infections.6 The role of Casp-1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis is controversial. "
"5","model","The host microbiota can be considered as a complex trait that is under host genetic control.19,20 Mouse models are crucial for the study of single-gene changes in the genome and are used widely to gain insight into the biology of human diseases. "
"6","model","The significant increase of this family in Casp-1and -7-KO mice might mean that these mice are protected in bacteria-induced colitis models, whereas the Casp-3-KO mice, which have significantly fewer Porphyromonadaceae, would be sensitized in these models. "
"7","knockout","We observed significant changes in the abundance of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, in particular the Lachnospiraceae, Porphyromonodaceae and Prevotellacea families, when comparing Casp-1, -7 and -3 knockout mice with wild-type mice. "
"8","knockout","In vivo experimental models of infection have demonstrated that Casp-1-knockout (KO) mice are more susceptible to a variety of infections.6 The role of Casp-1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis is controversial. "
