"3","wild","Results and Discussion General characteristics of the microbiomes of Casp-KO and -wild-type (WT) mice. "
"4","model","In vivo experimental models of infection have demonstrated that Casp-1-knockout (KO) mice are more susceptible to a variety of infections.6 The role of Casp-1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis is controversial. "
"5","model","The host microbiota can be considered as a complex trait that is under host genetic control.19,20 Mouse models are crucial for the study of single-gene changes in the genome and are used widely to gain insight into the biology of human diseases. "
"6","model","The significant increase of this family in Casp-1and -7-KO mice might mean that these mice are protected in bacteria-induced colitis models, whereas the Casp-3-KO mice, which have significantly fewer Porphyromonadaceae, would be sensitized in these models. "
"7","knockout","We observed significant changes in the abundance of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, in particular the Lachnospiraceae, Porphyromonodaceae and Prevotellacea families, when comparing Casp-1, -7 and -3 knockout mice with wild-type mice. "

"10","disease","Aberrant inflammatory and apoptotic caspase activity has been described in a large number of human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. "
"11","disease","However, experiments on germ-free mice and treatment with antibiotics already pointed out the important role of the microbiome in murine colitis and other diseases.16 Interestingly, a recent study linked the absence of the inflammasome component NRLP3 to a change in gut microbiota composition in naive mice.10 Today, the link between host (patho)physiology and the gut microbiome is being increasingly recognized and studied.10,17,18 In-depth knowledge of the bacterial ecosystem in relation to disease might pave the way for the generation of customized therapeutics and probiotics.

"12","disease","The host microbiota can be considered as a complex trait that is under host genetic control.19,20 Mouse models are crucial for the study of single-gene changes in the genome and are used widely to gain insight into the biology of human diseases. "
"13","disease","The precise composition of the species or OTUs represented by these two phyla, the detailed shifts in this composition upon treatment or disease, and/or the metabolic profile of the bacteria are certainly of importance to value this ratio. "
"14","disease","Given the nature of the families that differed most in abundance between WTand caspase-KO mice, and their reported associations with intestinal inflammation or disease, it is tempting to speculate about their role as ‘predisposing’, ‘colitogenic’ or ‘protective’ bacteria. "
"15","disease","Although microbiome studies in humans have resulted in an increased awareness regarding the importance of host–microbe interactions in health and disease, it remains challenging to determine the effect of isolated host factors on shaping the human microbial flora. "

"22","human","The Lachnospiraceae family was also found to be associated with the development of colitis and possibly, predisposition to colitis.25,27 The main benefit of Lachnospiraceae family members in the human intestine is their participation in carbohydrate fermentation into butyrate (a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)) and gas.28 SCFAs are important sources of energy for colonic epithelial cells and may enhance epithelial barrier integrity, and modulate the gastro-intestinal immune response.29 SFCAs can also induce autophagy to delay mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death.30 The decrease of Lachnospiraceae in Casp-7-KO mice could mean that they have less butyrate in their intestine and thus benefit less from the positive effects of this SCFA.

"23","human","As yet, it is very difficult to directly link changes in caspase activity withmicrobial modifications in the human gut, as the composition of the intestinal microflora is defined by a plethora of factors. "
