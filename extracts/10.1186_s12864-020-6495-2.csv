"31","environment","As a result of the extinction crisis of Siberian musk deer and economic and medical value of its musk, understanding the genetic basis and features, environment adaptions, and the musk secretion mechanism is necessary. "
"32","environment","It was shown that those PSGs are enriched in 8 pathways associated to metabolism (amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and lysine degradation), cellular processes (peroxisome and p53 signaling pathway), organismal systems (insulin secretion, pancreatic secretion, mineral absorption and bile secretion), and environmental information processing (cGMP-PKG signaling pathway) (Fig. 3b). "
"33","environment","This finding possibly avoids the Siberian musk deer from the DNA damage caused by UV radiation and hypoxia in high-altitude environments. "
"34","environment","The cold-climate interval and rising sea level at this stage could have contributed to a population expansion because an increase in grassland was likely under such environmental conditions [63]. "

"44","human","Evolutionary analysis and phylogeny Compared with protein-coding genes of nine other species (goat, sheep, cattle, white-tail deer, pig, horse, dog, human and mouse), we found 17,336 orthologous of WSMD that were shared by at least one species (Additional file 1: Table S11), and 14,936 orthologous shared by human, cattle, white-tailed deer and WSMD.
