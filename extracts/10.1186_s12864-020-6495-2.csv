"1","wild","RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Whole-genome sequencing of wild Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) provides insights into its genetic features Li Yi1†, Menggen Dalai2*†, Rina Su1†, Weili Lin3, Myagmarsuren Erdenedalai4, Batkhuu Luvsantseren4, Chimedragchaa Chimedtseren4*, Zhen Wang3* and Surong Hasi1* Abstract Background: Siberian musk deer, one of the seven species, is distributed in coniferous forests of Asia. "
"2","wild","Results: Here, we produced 3.10 Gb draft assembly of wild Siberian musk deer with a contig N50 of 29,145 bp and a scaffold N50 of 7,955,248 bp. "
"3","wild","Our phylogenetic analysis reveals that wild Siberian musk deer is closer to Bovidae than to Cervidae. "
"4","wild","Conclusions: Here, we present a high-quality draft genome of wild Siberian musk deer, which will provide a valuable genetic resource for further investigations of this economically important musk deer. "
"5","wild","In this study, we perform high-quality whole-genome sequencing of three wild Siberian musk deer (WSMD) from Mongolia, and transcriptome sequencing of one mixture of tissue from a naturally died female WSMD. "
"6","wild","Discussion In this study, we performed a draft genome of wild Siberian musk deer using next generation sequencing technology. "
"7","wild","Similar results have been obtained in some high plateau animal genome studies, such as avian [81], wild boars [82], hot-spring snake [83] and Tibetan chicken [84]. "
"8","wild","In this study, we report the first whole genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the wild Siberian musk deer. "
"9","wild","Comparative analysis of the gut microbiota composition between captive and wild forest musk deer. "
"10","wild","Genomic analyses identify distinct patterns of selection in domesticated pigs and Tibetan wild boars. "
"11","adaptation","Therefore, it is interesting to uncover evolutionary evidence for its adaptation by comparative analysis. "
"12","adaptation","It might be attributed possibly to musk deer adaptation to the cold and highaltitude environment (1000-4200m) where food sources and odorants are limited and diffused slowly, and the interactions between odorants and receptors weakened Yi et al. "
"13","adaptation","Comparative genomic analyses characterized genetic diversity, the population structure of Siberian musk deer, and even the genetic features associated with energy metabolism and adaptations in cold and highaltitude environments. "
"14","adaptation","Ground tit genome reveals avian adaptation to living at high altitudes in the Tibetan plateau. "
"15","adaptation","Comparative genomic investigation of high-elevation adaptation in ectothermic snakes. "
"16","adaptation","Genomic analyses reveal potential independent adaptation to high altitude in Tibetan chickens. "
"17","adaptation","Whole-genome sequencing of native sheep provides insights into rapid adaptations to extreme environments. "
"18","adaptation","Whole-genome sequencing of giant pandas provides insights into demographic history and local adaptation. "
"19","model","Gene models generated from all the methods were integrated by EVM (EvidenceModeler) to build a consensus gene set for the WSMD genome. "
"20","model","Historical fluctuations in effective population size (Ne) for the three individuals were constructed with the help of the Pair-wise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) model [59], three genomes returned concordant PSMC population trajectories that with three declines and two expansions (Fig. "
"21","model","Taking the musk deer as the foreground and other species as the background, the branch-site model (model = 2, NSsite = 2) with dN/dS ≤ 1 (fix_omega = 1, omega = 1) and dN/dS > 1 (fix_omega = 0) were compared. "
"22","model","The demographic inference was performed with the PSMC model (v0.6.5) [59]. "
"23","model","Gene prediction with a hidden Markov model and a new intron submodel. "
