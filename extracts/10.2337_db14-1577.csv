"1","wild","Bone marrow transplantation using wild-type C57BL/6 donors normalized expression of multiple genes regulating immune function and epithelial integrity in Glp1r2/2 recipient mice, whereas acute exendin-4 administration robustly induced the expression of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines in normal and injured intestine. "
"2","wild","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Mice Male or female C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice were from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and acclimated to the animal facility for a minimum of 1 week before analysis. "
"3","adaptation","Glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor modulates islet adaptation to metabolic stress in the ob/ob mouse. "
"4","model","Glp1r+/+. diabetes.diabetesjournals.org Yusta and Associates 2545 D ow nloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article-pdf/64/7/2537/580737/db141577.pdf by guest on 11 January 2022 Considerable evidence attests to the importance of inflammation and innate immunity in the control of metabolism (35,36); however, few studies have examined whether IELs play a role in the development and/or treatment of experimental models of type 2 diabetes or obesity. "
"5","model","Previous studies examining the relationship between proglucagon-derived peptides and control of gut inflammation have focused on the related L-cell peptide GLP-2, which potently suppresses inflammation in experimental models of gut injury (40–42). "
"6","model","Indeed, modulation (both gain and loss) of GLP-2R signaling robustly modifies gut barrier function and the extent of inflammation in murine models of diabetes characterized by gut injury and endotoxemia (46). "
"7","model","This hypothesis requires further validation through experimental models of metabolic dysfunction and inflammation. "
"8","model","Identification and characterisation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor expressing cells using a new transgenic mouse model. "
"9","model","Human [Gly2]GLP-2 reduces the severity of colonic injury in a murine model of experimental colitis. "
"10","knockout","Gene expression was examined in colonic RNA samples from Glp1r+/+ (WT) or Glp1r2/2 (knockout [KO]) mice (n = 8–12 mice/group) maintained on regular drinking water or drinking water supplemented with 3% DSS for 7 days. "
"11","knockout","Double incretin receptor knockout (DIRKO) mice reveal an essential role for the enteroinsular axis in transducing the glucoregulatory actions of DPP-IV inhibitors. "
