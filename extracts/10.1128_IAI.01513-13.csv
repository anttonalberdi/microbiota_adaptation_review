"1","wild","GF wild-type (WT) and IL-10/ 129 and B6 mice were colonized with 7 human-derived inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal bacteria and maintained under gnotobiotic conditions. "
"2","wild","To study IBD-related microbiota-host interactions at a more complex yet defined level, in preliminary studies we established a simplified human microbiota consortium (SIHUMI), composed of 7 well-characterized and sequenced human-derived and IBD-related enteric bacteria, in wild-type (WT) mouse strains and demonstrated that it forms a stable community in the mouse intestine that is maintained under gnotobiotic conditions (16). "
"3","adaptation","Bacterial adaptation to the gut environment favors successful colonization: microbial and metabonomic characterization of a simplified microbiota mouse model. "
"4","inbred","GF IL-10/ and WT control mice (on both the inbred 129 and B6 backgrounds) were derived and maintained in the National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center (NGRRC), University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. "
"5","inbred","In the present study, we assessed the influence of host genetic background on the severity of SIHUMI-induced colitis in susceptible mice, using two widely used inbred mouse strains: 129 and B6. "
"6","model","A subset of IBD-relevant human enteric bacterial species preferentially stimulates bacterial antigen-specific TH1 and TH17 immune responses in this model, independent of luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations. "
"7","model","In addition, rodent models monoassociated with bacteria relevant to the dysbiosis of IBD, such as certain Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strains, demonstrated that single intestinal bacteria can selectively induce host inflammation and also provided insights into underlying disease mechanisms (6, 11–13). "
"8","model","Nevertheless, the study of specific bacterium-host interactions by use of conventional and monoassociated rodent models has some limitations. "
"9","model","The microbiotas of conventional animal models are too complex and variable to easily define and manipulate the functionally dominant component species and strain. "
"10","model","To resolve these shortcomings, new animal models with defined, interacting intestinal microbiotas need to be developed. "
"11","model","Recently, several studies described the development of alternative rodent models of a simplified human microbiota, showing stable microbial and metabolomic characterization (14, 15). "
"12","model","We used this unique model to explore host-microbe interactions, demonstrating that the aggressiveness of colitis is greater in 129 than in B6 mouse strains and that concentrations of individual SIHUMI species are determined by host genetic background, anatomical distribution, and the presence of colonic inflammation. "
"13","model","To investigate IBD-related microbiota-host interactions at a fully defined but more complex interactive level than that with monoassociated mouse models, we established a simplified human microbiota consortium, composed of 7 human-derived and IBD-relevant gut bacteria, in WT and IL-10/ mice on 2 genetic backgrounds. "
"14","model","Although several studies have described simplified gnotobiotic rodent models containing 7 to 10 human bacteria or interactions between a commensal and enteric pathogens, those studies primarily showed successful microbial colonization and metabolomic characterization in WT rodents (14, 15, 20). "
"15","model","These results agree with previous reports demonstrating that B6 mice are relatively resistant to colitis in multiple models of acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas 129 mice are highly colitogenic (24–26). "
"16","model","Although the exact genetic loci responsible for colitis susceptibility have not been identified completely in murine models (27, 28), our data confirm that the host genetic background has a strong influence on the aggressiveness of colitis and demonstrate differential genetic susceptibility to chronic bacterium-induced, immune-mediated colitis. "
"17","model","Our humanized gnotobiotic model with SIHUMI is an important resource that can be used in further clinically relevant studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which CD-associated innate immunity genes regulate the composition, spatial relationships, and function of a defined intestinal microbiota and to investigate the impact of environmental factors, such as diet, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, on host immune responses, bacterial community structure and function, and colonic inflammation in IBD.
