"1","wild","GF wild-type (WT) and IL-10/ 129 and B6 mice were colonized with 7 human-derived inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal bacteria and maintained under gnotobiotic conditions. "
"2","wild","To study IBD-related microbiota-host interactions at a more complex yet defined level, in preliminary studies we established a simplified human microbiota consortium (SIHUMI), composed of 7 well-characterized and sequenced human-derived and IBD-related enteric bacteria, in wild-type (WT) mouse strains and demonstrated that it forms a stable community in the mouse intestine that is maintained under gnotobiotic conditions (16). "
"3","adaptation","Bacterial adaptation to the gut environment favors successful colonization: microbial and metabonomic characterization of a simplified microbiota mouse model. "
