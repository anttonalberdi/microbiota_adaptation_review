"1","wild","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSâ€”Metabolic and inflammatory properties were assessed in wild-type (WT) and NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. "
"2","wild","Male wild-type (WT) and NOD1/22/2 mice were on an HFD (TD.93075; Harlan Laboratories Teklad, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) for 16 weeks, and following insulin tolerance tests (ITTs), mice were anesthetized and the entire gonadal adipose tissue depot and livers were surgically excised and weighed. "
"3","adaptation","This further allowed us to explore whether insulin resistance can arise acutely without the long-term phenotypic adaptations that might occur in the absence of NOD proteins. "
