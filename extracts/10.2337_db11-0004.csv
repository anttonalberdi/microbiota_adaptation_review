"1","wild","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Metabolic and inflammatory properties were assessed in wild-type (WT) and NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. "
"2","wild","Male wild-type (WT) and NOD1/22/2 mice were on an HFD (TD.93075; Harlan Laboratories Teklad, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) for 16 weeks, and following insulin tolerance tests (ITTs), mice were anesthetized and the entire gonadal adipose tissue depot and livers were surgically excised and weighed. "
"3","adaptat","This further allowed us to explore whether insulin resistance can arise acutely without the long-term phenotypic adaptations that might occur in the absence of NOD proteins. "
"4","model","These results implicate NOD1 and/or NOD2 in inflammatory and metabolic responses throughout a physiologically relevant model of insulin resistance. "
"5","model","The inherent limitations of any cultured cell model should be considered, which in the case of 3T3-L1 adipocytes may include expressing relatively low NOD2 transcript. "
"6","knockout","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Metabolic and inflammatory properties were assessed in wild-type (WT) and NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. "
"7","knockout","These mice were used to generate NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice with a minimum of 10 generations of backcrossing into the C57BL/6 background. "
"8","knockout","We first established a role for NOD proteins in metabolic disease by demonstrating that NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice are more insulin tolerant compared with WT mice after 16 weeks on HFD, evinced by a reduced AUC of blood glucose during an ITT (P , 0.05; Fig. "
"9","knockout","WT and NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice were fed an HFD for 16 weeks, upon which the following parameters were measured. "
"10","knockout","In summary, NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice were protected from HFD-induced insulin intolerance, lipid accumulation, and inflammation in adipose and liver. "
"11","disease","We first established a role for NOD proteins in metabolic disease by demonstrating that NOD1/22/2 double knockout mice are more insulin tolerant compared with WT mice after 16 weeks on HFD, evinced by a reduced AUC of blood glucose during an ITT (P , 0.05; Fig. "
"12","disease","Given that bacterial components are able to penetrate mucosal barriers to promote metabolic aberrations, the results identify a constituent of Gram-negative bacteria additional to LPS as a potential trigger for metabolic disease (12,42). "
"13","disease","Overall, the results of this study position the meso-DAP PGN as a potential trigger for metabolic disease and demonstrate that NOD1 is a possible link between innate immunity and metabolism. "
