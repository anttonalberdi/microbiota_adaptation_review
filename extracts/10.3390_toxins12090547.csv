"1","wild","However, the adenine-induced kidney damage in wild-type mice was comparable to that in IL-17A-deficient mice, suggesting that IL-17A does not play a major role in the disease condition. "
"2","wild","Deficiency of IL-17A Did Not Influence Adenine-Induced Kidney Damage To evaluate the role of IL-17A in adenine-induced kidney damage, we compared Il17a-/and wild-type mice (Figure 6a). "
"3","wild","When mice were fed the adenine-rich diet, the degree of kidney dysfunction (measured by the elevation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) was not significantly different between Il17a-/and wild-type mice (Figure 6b). "
"4","wild","Deficiency of IL-17A Did Not Influence Adenine-Induced Kidney Damage To evaluate the role of IL-17A in adenine-induced kidney damage, we compared Il17a-/and wild-type mice (Figure 6a). "
"5","wild","When mice were fed the adenine-rich diet, the degree of kidney dysfunction (measured by the elevation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) was not significantly different between Il17a-/and wild-type mice (Figure 6b). "
"6","wild","Deficiency of IL-17A did not affect adenine-induced kidney damage. (a) Experimental course of wild-type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL17 KO) mice treated with or without adenine. (b) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. (c) Histological analysis of the kidney sections using Masson’s trichrome, Sirius red and F4/80 stain. "
"7","wild","Deficiency of IL-17 id not affect adenin -induce kidney damage. (a) Experimental cours of wild-type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL17 KO) mice treated with or without adenine. (b) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. (c) Histological analysis of the kidney sections using Masson’s trichrome, Sirius red and F4/80 stain. "
"8","wild","For Experiment 4, at eight weeks of age, male Il17a-/mice and wild-type C57BL/6JJcl mice were fed the normal CE-2 diet or the 0.2% adenine-containing diet for six weeks. "
