"32","disease","Introduction Recent evidence has highlighted the importance of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of kidney diseases and proposed a relationship between the gut and kidney, named the gut-kidney axis [1,2]. "
"33","disease","Gut microbiota modulates disease severity in various kidney diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetic kidney disease, glomerular nephritis, and acute kidney injury [3–7]. "
"34","disease","Microbiota is also involved in the CKD-related systemic complications such as cardiovascular diseases, uremic sarcopenia, and mineral bone disorders [8–10]. "
"35","disease","The microbiota presents both positive and negative metabolic effects, since it is responsible for producing beneficial metabolites in kidney diseases such as short-chain fatty acids [13,14] and harmful metabolites such as uremic toxins [15,16]. "
"36","disease","Owing to the various roles played by the microbiota, its depletion either by germ-free conditions or by treatment with antibiotics can influence every kidney disease differently. "
"37","disease","For instance, studies have shown that antibiotic treatment attenuates kidney damage and renal inflammation via the suppression of inflammatory responses in ischemia-reperfusion damage [20], congenital kidney disease [21], and autoimmune glomerular nephritis [22,23]. "
