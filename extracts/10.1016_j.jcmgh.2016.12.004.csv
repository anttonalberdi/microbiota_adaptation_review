"1","wild","TLR4 wild-type and TLR4-/bone marrow chimeric mice andTRIF-/mice were fed CDAA or a control diet for 22 weeks. "
"2","wild","RESULTS: In the CDAA diet–induced NASH, the mice with wildtype bone marrow had higher alanine aminotransferase and hepatic tumor necrosis factor levels than the mice with TLR4-/bone marrow. "
"3","wild","The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score showed that both wild-type and TLR4-/bone marrow chimeras had reduced hepatic steatosis, and that both types of chimeras had similar levels of inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning to whole-body wild-type mice. "
"4","wild","Notably, wild-type recipients showed more liver fibrosis than TLR4-/recipients. "
"5","wild","Although TRIF-/mice showed reduced hepatic steatosis, these mice showed more liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis than wildtype mice. "
"6","wild","TRIF-/stellate cells and hepatocytes produced more C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and C-C motif chemokine ligand than wild-type cells in response to lipopolysaccharide. "
"7","wild","All animal experiments were approved by the University of California San Diego and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Bone Marrow Transplantation We performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiments as previously described.14 Briefly, bone marrow (BM) cells (1  107 cells) obtained from wild-type and TLR4-/mice were transplanted through tail veins after the recipient mice were lethally irradiated (10 Gy). "
"8","wild","To explore the responsible cell types for TLR4-mediated NASH and fibrosis, BM cells from wild-type or TLR4-/mice were transplanted into wild-type or TLR4-/recipient mice followed by feeding them a CDAA diet for 22 weeks to induce NASH and fibrosis. "
"9","wild","Spleen cells from TLR4-/mice transplanted with wild-type BM express similar TLR4 levels to the spleen cells from whole-body wild-type mice, and the cells from wildtype mice transplanted with TLR4-/BM showed very low levels of TLR4, indicating a high efficiency of the engraftment of donor BM (Figure 1B). "
"10","wild","The chimeric mice containing wild-type BM showed similar levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression, whereas the chimeric mice with TLR4-/BM showed reduced ALT and hepatic TNF levels (Figure 1C–E). "
"11","wild","The histologic assessment of NAFLD activity score showed that wild-type recipients of TLR4-/BM and TLR4-/recipients of either wild-type or TLR4-/BMFigure 1. "
"12","wild","WT, wild type. "
"13","wild","Interestingly, TLR4-/recipients of wild-type BM and wild-type recipients of TLR4-/BM had similar levels of inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatocyte ballooning to whole-body wild-type mice (Figure 1C and F). "
"14","wild","This suggests that either wild-type BM or wild-type recipient cells are involved in TLR4-mediated liver inflammation. "
"15","wild","The chimeric mice with wild-type resident cells (including HSCs) showed a similar degree of collagen production and a-SMA expression, whereas the chimeric mice with TLR4-/resident cells had reduced fibrosis and HSC activation (Figure 1G–I). "
"16","wild","Our previous study showed that MyD88 is a crucial adaptor protein for the development of NASH and fibrosis, and the function of the TRIF pathway still is unclear in NASH fibrosis.10 To investigate the role of TRIF in the development of NASH, wild-type and TRIF-/mice were subjected to 22 weeks of CDAA diet feeding. "
"17","wild","TRIF-/mice showed much less hepatic steatosis than wild-type mice (Figure 2A). "
"18","wild","To our surprise, TRIF-/mice presented more inflammatory cell infiltration along with higher serum ALT levels and hepatic TNF messenger RNA expression than wild-type mice (Figure 2A–D). "
"19","wild","The expression of interleukin (IL)10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, is regulated by the TRIF-IRF3–mediated pathway.12 TRIF-/mice showed significantly lower IL10 expression than wild-type mice (Figure 2D). "
"20","wild","White square, wild-type mice; black square, TRIF-/mice; gray square, TLR4-/mice. "
"21","wild","May 2017 Role of TRIF in Mouse NASH 475of profibrogenic genes (collagen a1[I] and a-SMA) compared with wild-type mice (Figure 2E–G). "
"22","wild","This also suggests that TRIF-mediated IL10may play a role as a negative regulator of liver inflammation.TLR4 Signaling Potentiates Palmitic Acid–Induced Hepatocyte Lipid Accumulation Through TRIF TRIF-/mice showed reduced hepatic steatosis compared with wild-type mice (Figure 2A). "
"23","wild","White square, wild obtained in 2 independent experiments. "
"24","wild","To clarify whether TLR4 and TRIF mediate lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, we treated primary hepatocytes, isolated from wild-type, TRIF-/-, and TLR4-/mice, with palmitic acids and/or LPS. "
"25","wild","Palmitic acids induced lipid accumulation in all primary hepatocytes from wild-type, TRIF-/-, and TLR4-/mice, whereas LPS alone did not increase lipid accumulation as assessed by Oil Red O staining (Figure 3A). "
"26","wild","When we combined the treatment with palmitic acids and LPS, only the wild-type hepatocytes showed severe lipid accumulation, whereas TRIF-/and TLR4-/hepatocytes did not (Figure 3A). "
"27","wild","3, No. 3wild-type hepatocytes, and was reduced in TRIF-/as well as TLR4-/hepatocytes (Figure 3B). "
"28","wild","DGAT2 was up-regulated in wild-type, but not in TRIF-/-, hepatocytes (Figure 3C). "
"29","wild","Consistently, increased DGAT2 levels in wild-type livers were reduced in TRIF-/livers (Figure 3D). "
"30","wild","The TLR4–TRIF signaling promotes hepatocyte ap cytes were isolated from wild-type (WT), TRIF-/-, and TLR4-/mic create fat-accumulated hepatocytes. "
"31","wild","Similar results were obtained in 2 independent ex wild-type mice; black square, TRIF-/mice; gray square, TLR4-/ palmitic acids. "
"32","wild","After 24 hours of palmitate treatment, wild-type, TRIF-/-, and TLR4-/hepatocytes stored lipid droplets (Figure 3A). "
"33","wild","In palmitate-pretreated, lipid-accumulated wild-type hepatocytes, hepatocyte apoptosis and LDH release were increased after LPS treatment, whereas these events were not seen in TRIF-/and TLR4-/lipidaccumulated hepatocytes (Figure 4A and B), indicating that the TLR4–TRIF pathway positively regulates hepatocyte death in lipid-accumulated hepatocytes. "
"34","wild","Consistent with previous studies examining macrophages,17 TRIF-/Kupffer cells produced CXCL1 and CCL3 at similar levels to wild-type cells, whereas TRIF deficiency decreased the LPS-induced production of CCL5 and IL10 in Kupffer cells (Figure 5A). "
"35","wild","Interestingly, TRIF-/HSCs produced higher levels of CXCL1 and CCL3 than wildtype HSCs (Figure 5C). "
"36","wild","CCL5 that usually is regulated through the TRIF-dependent pathway in immune cells, was up-regulated and showed higher production in TRIF-/HSCs than wild-type HSCs (Figure 5C). "
"37","wild","We previously reported that hepatocytes produce neutrophil-recruiting chemokines, such as CXCL1, in response to TLR ligands.18 In wild-type hepatocytes, LPS treatment increased the production of CXCL1 and CCL3. "
"38","wild","These results show that CXCL1 and CCL3 production is not abolished by TRIF deficiency in all cell types and that TRIF-/HSCs produce higher CXCL1, CCL3, and CCL5 than the wild-type HSCs; these data further suggest that CXCL1, CCL3, and higher production of chemokines in HSCs may contribute to promoting liver inflammation in CDAA diet–fed TRIF-/mice. "
"39","wild","Because CXCL1 is a potent neutrophil-attracting chemokine and CCL3 enables recruitment of monocytes/macrophages,19,20 we examined hepatic CXCL1 and CCL3 expression and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in wild-type and TRIF-/mice after 22 weeks of CDAA diet feeding. "
"40","wild","CXCL1 expression and neutrophil infiltration were exacerbated in TRIF-/mice compared with wild-type mice (Figure 6A and B). "
"41","wild","A number of human studies have suggested that the severity of liver inflammation is associated with insulin resistance in NASH patients.21,22 To investigate whether liver inflammation and fibrosis are involved in insulin resistance, glucose and insulin tolerance tests were examined in CDAA diet–fed wild-type and TRIF-/mice. "
"42","wild","Both glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed that insulin sensitivity was improved in TRIF-/mice compared with wild-type mice (Figure 7A and B). "
"43","wild","On the CDAA diet, the body and liver weight were slightly, but significantly, lower in TRIF-/mice compared with wild-type mice (Figure 7C and D). "
"44","wild","The present study attempted to answer this question by using TLR4 wild-type and TLR4-/BM chimeric mice. "
"45","wild","(A and B) Primary Kupffer cells, (C and D) HSCs, and (E and F) hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) mice, (A, C, and E) TRIF-/mice, and (B, D, and F) MyD88-/mice. "
"46","wild","White square, wild-type mice; black square, TRIF-/mice; gray square, MyD88-/mice. "
"47","wild","The assessment of the NAFLD activity score using H&E staining showed similar levels of inflammatory cell infiltration in TLR4-/recipients of wild-type BM andy increased infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in e-supplemented amino acid–defined diet (CS) or CDAA (CD) ger RNA (mRNA) expression was determined by quantitative fluorescence for Ly6G and their quantifications. "
"48","wild","White square, wild-type ontal bars represent average. "
"49","wild","(A) A glucose tolerance test (GTT) and (B) an insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed on the wild-type (WT) and TRIF-/mice fed with 22 weeks of the CDAA diet. "
"50","wild","3, No. 3wild-type recipients of TLR4-/BM (Figure 1C and F). "
"51","wild","It is conceivable that either wild-type BM or wild-type recipient cells are involved in TLR4-mediated liver inflammation. "
"52","wild","In wild-type recipients of TLR4-/BM, cytokines/chemokines produced from wild-type recipient cells, including HSCs and hepatocytes, might affect activation of TLR4-/BM-derived immune cells, which play a role in liver inflammation. "
"53","wild","It also is possible that increased numbers of HSCs in wild-type recipients of TLR4-/BM have been determined as infiltrated inflammatory cells through H&E staining. "
"54","wild","Although CCL5 is produced through the TRIF-dependent pathway in immune cells, including Kupffer cells, TRIF-/HSCs have a higher capacityto produce CCL5 than wild-type HSCs (Figures 5 and 8). "
"55","wild","In the present study, TRIF-/mice showed overt liver inflammation induced by the CDAA diet compared with wild-type mice. "
"56","wild","Our findings corroborate a recent study that showed hepatocytes or HSC-derived CXCL1 as crucial for recruiting neutrophils in liver diseases.18,19,28 Although CCL5 production is decreased in TRIF-/Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, these cells can produce similar levels of CXCL1 and CCL3 compared with wildtype cells. "
"57","wild","However, it is a noteworthy fact that there is an association of hepatic steatosis and adipose tissue mass with insulin resistancebecause TRIF-/mice showed reduced hepatosteatosis and body weight compared with wild-type mice. "
"58","model","METHODS: A choline-deficient amino acid defined (CDAA) diet was used for the mouse NASH model. "
"59","model","BM-derived and resident live inflammation, and fibrosis in the murine NASH model induc BM from b-actin promoter-driven GFP-transgenic mice after clodronate was injected. "
"60","model","TRIF-/mice showed severe i NASH model induced by the CDAA diet. "
"61","model","The yield of Kupffer cell replacement with BM cells using our technology, which performs irradiation and BM transplantation in combination with Kupffer cell depletion, is approximately 95%.24 Although Kupffer cell–specific Cre transgenic mice targeting Clec4f were reported recently,25 our method still is one of the best models to study the distinct functions of Kupffer cells and HSCs. "
"62","model","Compared with the high-fat diet–induced fatty liver model, the CDAA diet model recapitulated human NASH pathology well because it induces inflammatory cell infiltration, HSC activation, and fibrosis in addition to hepatosteatosis.10 Thus, the CDAA diet model is one of the suitable models for studying NASH and its related HSC activation and fibrosis. "
"63","model","In the mouse NASH model, translocated LPS stimulates TLR4 on Kupffer cells, HSCs, and hepatocytes. "
"64","model","Moreover, we showed that hepatic steatosis and adipose tissue mass, but not hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, are associated with insulin resistance in the NASH mouse model. "
"65","disease","The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score showed that both wild-type and TLR4-/bone marrow chimeras had reduced hepatic steatosis, and that both types of chimeras had similar levels of inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning to whole-body wild-type mice. "

"68","disease","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, commonly associated with obesity and insulin resistance. "
"69","disease","Because phosphatidylcholine is required for the secretion of very low density lipoprotein from hepatocytes, reduced choline levels can exacerbate fat accumulation in hepatocytes.5 Increased blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels often are observed in patients with NASH.5–7 Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern-recognition receptor for LPS and induces activation of innate immune signaling through adaptor proteins MyD88 and TIR-domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-b (TRIF).8 Previous studies clearly have shown the critical roles of TLR4 and MyD88 in promoting NASH and its related fibrosis.9–11 Interestingly, Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), downstream of the TRIF-dependent pathway, plays paradoxic roles between alcoholic liver disease and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD.

"71","disease","This indicates a dissociation between insulin resistance and liver inflammation.Discussion The contributions of TLR4 signaling and its activation by translocated gut-derived LPS to chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, have been well established.8,23 Kupffer cells are believed to play crucial roles in TLR4-mediated alcoholic steatohepatitis and NASH development.11 Although we previously described the function of TLR4 in HSC activation and liver fibrosis,14 the importance of HSCs in TLR4mediated NASH development is poorly understood.
