"1","wild","Converse to wildtype counterparts, Psae colonized the intestines of IL-10−/− mice with chronic colitis following peroral challenge, but did not lead to changes in intestinal microbiota composition. "
"2","wild","Our very recent study revealed for the first time that mere intestinal carriage of a clinical MDR Psae isolate by otherwise healthy microbiota-depleted wildtype (WT) mice resulted in distinct local as well as systemic pro-inflammatory immune responses13. "

"4","model","The applied inflammation model was, however, too acute to decipher additional inflammatory sequelae of the applied Psae strain. "
"5","model","Novel murine infection models provide deep insights into the “menage a trois” of Campylobacter jejuni, microbiota and host innate immunity. "

"8","model","MyD88/TLR9 mediated immunopathology and gut microbiota dynamics in a novel murine model of intestinal graft-versus-host disease. "
"9","disease","Psae infection accelerated both macroscopic (i.e. clinical) and microscopic disease (i.e. colonic epithelial apoptosis), that were accompanied by increased intestinal pro-inflammatory immune responses as indicated by elevated colonic numbers of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets and enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IFN-γ in mesenteric lymph nodes of Psae-infected as compared to unchallenged IL-10−/− mice. "
"10","disease","Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Psae), constitute opportunistic pathogens, that may cause a variety of nosocomial infections particularly in immunocompromised patients or patients with chronic pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis1–4. "
"11","disease","Information whether intestinal inflammation may also facilitate stable Psae colonization and may even worsen the outcome of the underlying disease are scarce, however. "
"12","disease","It is thus rather surprising, however, that studies addressing the immunopathological consequences of intestinal colonization and infection of vertebrates with Psae in health and disease including intestinal inflammation are scare to date. "
"13","disease","In the present study we further showed that chronic colitis in conventionally colonized IL-10−/− mice (that had not been subjected to antibiotic pretreatment) did not only facilitate murine MDR Psae carriage, but also worsened distinct features of the underlying disease as shown on both macroscopic (i.e. clinical) and microscopic Figure 5. "
"14","disease","Remarkably, accelerated disease was not restricted to the intestinal tract but could also be observed systemically, given that Psae-colonized IL-10−/− mice displayed elevated TNF and IFN-γ serum levels. "
"15","disease","In ongoing studies we are currently unraveling the distinct intraluminal factors favoring and preventing intestinal MDR Psae establishment in health and disease. "

"18","human","Heimesaat1 The World Health Organization has rated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Psae) as serious threat to human health. "
"19","human","Already early studies suggest that besides contaminated respirators and other medical equipment the human gastrointestinal tract might be an important internal source of Psae infection in hospitals6,7. "
"20","human","Particularly a preceding antimicrobial treatment had been shown to disturb the complex intestinal microbiota composition and therefore to compromise the physiological colonization resistance9–12 which, in turn, may enable invading (opportunistic) pathogens including MDR Psae to establish within the human gastrointestinal ecosystem13. "
"21","human","Discussion The rising increases in incidences of MDR bacterial Gram-negative strains including Psae colonizing and infecting humans as well as live stock animals all over the world have resulted in an increased awareness not only of health care professionals, but also of the general public and the political institutions for this global threat of human health and for the actually very limited strategies preventing morbidity and mortality2,5,20. "
"22","human","In addition, we were able to show in another recent survey that acute small intestinal inflammation facilitated MDR Psae acquisition by mice harboring a human gut microbiota23. "
"23","human","The numbers of 16S rRNA gene copies per ng DNA of main bacterial groups abundant in the murine and human gut microbiota were quantified applying quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with species-, generaor group-specific 16S rRNA gene primers (Tib MolBiol, Germany) as stated elsewhere11,27,34.
