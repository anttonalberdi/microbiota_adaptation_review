"1","wild","Converse to wildtype counterparts, Psae colonized the intestines of IL-10−/− mice with chronic colitis following peroral challenge, but did not lead to changes in intestinal microbiota composition. "
"2","wild","Our very recent study revealed for the first time that mere intestinal carriage of a clinical MDR Psae isolate by otherwise healthy microbiota-depleted wildtype (WT) mice resulted in distinct local as well as systemic pro-inflammatory immune responses13. "
