"1","wild","(B) Score of staining of grafts in WT and TLR4−/−B6 recipients (n = 3 mice in each group). *p < 0.05 compared to wild-type day 7. "
"2","mutant","Mice BALB/c (H-2d), C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b), TLR4 mutant mice (C.C3lr4Lps−d/J) on a BALB/c background (TLR4−/−BALB/c, H-2d), LR4-C3H/HeJ on a C3H background (TLR4C3H/HeJ, H-2k), and 57BL/10ScNJ (TLR4−/−B10; H-2b) were purchased from the Jackon Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). "
"3","mutant","TLR4−/−BALB/c originated from TLR4 mutant mice that have an amino acid substitution that does not affect receptor expression but prevents its signaling, whereas TLR4−/−B6 mice do not express TLR4 protein [12]. "
"4","model","In an allogenic islet transplantation model, genetic disruption of TLR4 on donor isletseywords: oll-like receptor AMP slet allograft rejection had no effect on allograft survival, whereas TLR4 deficiency in recipients lead to prolonged graft survival. "
"5","model","Diabetic model, islet isolation and transplantation The recipients were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal njection of 180 mg/kg streptozotocin and considered diabetic hen the tail-vein blood glucose concentration was more than 50 mg/dl for 2 consecutive days. "
"6","model","Injection of nti-CD25 monoclonal antibody has been shown to efficiently eplete CD4+CD25+ T cells in transplant models [19,20]. "
"7","model","Our in vivo and in vitro results describe a unique mechanism where TLR4 stimulation in allogeneic transplantation model induces inflammation and suppress the Treg development. "
"8","model","Targeted gene disruption of the heat shock protein 72 gene (hsp70.1) in the donor tissue is associated with a prolonged rejection-free survival in the murine skin allograft model. "
"9","environment","The in vivo environment of cytokines and TLR ligands might further neutralize Treg’s suppressive potential. "
"10","human","To date, 13 human and 9 murine TLRs have been escribed [2]. "
"11","human","There are emerging data from experimental and human studies that TLR4 is able to sense endogenous ligands heat shock proteins (HSPs), hyaluronan, the extra domain A (EDA) of fibronectin, fibrinogen, and high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute allograft rejection by amplifying alloimmune responses [3–6]. "
"12","human","Donor Tolllike receptor 4 contributes to ischemia and reperfusion injury following human kidney transplantation. "
