"
"11","environment","Along with the genotype of the fish host, external environment plays an important role in determining the composition of the internal microbiome. "
"12","environment","Here, we characterized the variability of the microbiome of wild Crucian carp (Carassius auratus), along with those of their surrounding environments (water and mud). "
"13","environment","We found that each environment had distinct bacterial communities, with varying composition and structure. "
"14","environment","Each environment had unique OTUs, but the fewest unique OTUs (97) were found in the Crucian carp gut. "
"15","environment","There were significant differences in the relative abundances of different bacterial phyla in the different environments. "
"16","environment","Bacterial communities exist in virtually all global environments; these microenvironments provide specific biotic and abiotic conditions for the residing bacterial communities (Fierer & Jackson, 2006). "
"17","environment","Within microbiome research, most attention has been directed toward the bacterial communities inhabiting the fish farm environment or within the fish intestine (Indugu, Bittinger, Kumar, Vecchiarelli, & Pitta, 2016; Sun et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016, 2017; Zhuang et al., 2016). "
"18","environment","Although several studies are available which treat the bacterial communities of the fish intestine and the fish farm separately, few studies have focused on the interactions between the fish intestinal microbiomes of fish (such as Crucian Asia) and their surrounding fish farm environment. "
"19","environment","It is therefore important to compare the microbiota of the Crucian carp gut to the microbiota of its external environment. "
"20","environment","Original species and an enclosure can ensure the original connection between Crucian carp and environments. "
"21","environment","To control for differences in sampling effort across the three environments, we rarefied each sample to 26,779 sequences before calculating diversity indices. "
"22","environment","To compare the composition of identified community members in different environments, we calculated a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix based on the rarefied data (26,779 sequences per sample) and squareroot transformed the read abundance data (Beckers et al., 2017). "
"23","environment","We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) in R v3.2.2 to calculate the overall similarity in bacterial community structure across all environments. "
"24","environment","We then tested whether the OTUs in the different environments were significantly different using multiple response F IGURE  1  (a) Relative abundance of bacterial phyla in Crucian carp intestine, water, and mud. (b) Ternary phase diagram showing the relative abundance of various bacterial phyla. "
"25","environment","The three vertices represent the three environments, and each circle represents a different bacterial phylum. "
"26","environment","The size of each circle is proportional to relative abundance; the closer the circle is to the vertex, the higher the relative abundance of the group in that environment. "

"29","environment","MetaStat tests the correlation between the environment (Crucian carp gut, water, or mud) and the relative abundance of several bacterial phyla using hypothesis testing. "

"34","environment","Most of the OTUs we identified occurred in multiple environments, with 612 OTUs occurring in all three environments (Figure 4). "

"42","environment","4  | DISCUSSION 4.1 | Microbiomes of the three environments Our results were consistent with previous comparisons of the microbiotas of fish intestines and external environments (Sanchez, Weng, Riener, Schulze, & Linington, 2012; Schmidt, Smith, Melvin, & AmaralZettler, 2015). "
"43","environment","The external environments of the Crucian carp used in this study were fresh water and mud. "
"44","environment","In fish, the external environment is the main factor affecting the intestinal microbiota. "
"45","environment","Previous studies have shown that the microbiotas of different environments have different microhabitats (Eichner, Erb, Timmis, & WagnerDöbler, 1999; Liu, Chan, & Fang, 2002; Pinto, Xi, & Raskin, 2012; VazMoreira, Nunes, & Manaia, 2014). "
"46","environment","The Crucian carp lived in the fresh water from its birth, so we predicted that the source of the Fusobacteria in the Crucian carp gut was the mud environment. "
"47","environment","4.2 | How variable are the bacterial communities associated with different environments? "
"48","environment","The rank abundance curves differed substantially among the three environments (Figure 8). "
"49","environment","Most of the OTUs we identified occur in all three environments. "
"50","environment","Therefore, our data suggested that most of Crucian carp intestinal microbiome comes from the external environment. "
"51","environment","As Crucian carp are under extreme selective pressure to adapt to various environments (Matikainen & Vornanen, 1992), it may be that Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria have been retained by the fish only because they are required for basic vital activity and function. "
"52","environment","These structurally simple phyla dominate in the Crucian carp gut; it may be that their simple, mutable structure allows the bacteria to adapt more quickly to various aqueous environments. "
"53","environment","Future studies of environmental microbiota should consider the connections between different subsystems, as bacteria may be transported between these in various ways. "
"54","environment","Further studies of the microbiota of aquatic environments will lead to a better understanding of fish health maintenance and assessment. "
"55","environment","With detailed knowledge of the interactions between the microbiotas of external and internal environments, aquaculture practices can be improved by, for example, altering the microbiotas of the external environment to promote beneficial bacterial growth in the fish intestine. "
