"1","wild","InfectionwithC. difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22/ mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","To investigate the role of IL-22 in host protection during C. difficile infection, we assessed the survival of Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection and found strikingly higher mortality rates in Il22/ mice than in wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 1B). "
"3","mutant","InfectionwithC. difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22/ mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. "
"4","model","Previous studies have showna critical role for neutrophils in the elimination of translocated commensals at intestinal sites in the mouse model of C. difficile infection (Hasegawa et al., 2010; Hasegawa et al., 2012). "
"5","model","Thus, robust induction of IL-22 requires intestinal infection in the C. difficile infection model. "
"6","model","However, we found no significant differences between Il22/ mice and WT mice in the microbiota composition before or after C. difficile infection, suggesting that IL-22 does not regulate the composition of microbiota in all infection models. "
"7","model","In other infection models, IL-22 protects the host against pathogens via the induction of/ and WT mice infected or uninfected with C. difficile. "
"8","model","In the C. difficile infection model, IL-22 plays a critical role in complement-mediated elimination of pathobionts that have disseminated systemically, at least in part, by upregulating C3 expression. "
"9","model","In theC. difficile infection model, inflammasome-mediated IL-1b production is also critical for both local (intestinal) and systemic immune responses by facilitating neutrophil recruitment and promoting elimination of commensals after C. difficile infection (Hasegawa et al. "
"10","model","The elimination of commensals by antibiotics improves host survival after C. difficile infection in the mouse model, suggesting a potential therapeutic application. "
"11","model","Our study has shown that g-enterobacterial commensals as one of the dominant pathobionts responsible for complications of C. difficile infection in the mouse model. "

"13","disease","Immunity ArticleInterleukin-22 Regulates the Complement System to Promote Resistance against Pathobionts after Pathogen-Induced Intestinal Damage Mizuho Hasegawa,1 Shoko Yada,1,4 Meng Zhen Liu,1 Nobuhiko Kamada,2 Raúl Muñoz-Planillo,1,3 Nhu Do,1 Gabriel Núñez,1,3 and Naohiro Inohara1,* 1Department of Pathology 2Internal Medicine 3Comprehensive Cancer Center University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA 4Student Medical Academia Center and Department of Public Health, Graduate School of Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi 755-8505, Japan *Correspondence: ino@umich.edu http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2014.09.010SUMMARY Pathobionts play a critical role in disease development, but the immune mechanisms against pathobionts remain poorly understood. "
"14","disease","However, the gut microbiota also includes potentially virulent species, called pathobionts, that can cause disease when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted, particularly in immunocompromised hosts (Chow and Mazmanian, 2010; Kamada et al., 2013). "
"15","disease","Indeed, disruption of the healthy microbiota by several mechanisms, including antibiotic treatment, results in dysbiosis, which can lead to the accumulation of pathobionts and disease (Kamada et al., 2013; Pham620 Immunity 41, 620–632, October 16, 2014 ª2014 Elsevier Inc.and Lawley 2014). "
"16","disease","However, the mechanisms whereby pathobionts give rise to disease remain poorly understood. "
"17","disease","Although the cause of severe complications and mortality associated with C. difficile infection remains poorly understood, animal studies suggest that commensal bacteria contribute to disease severity. "
"18","disease","Unlike C. difficile infection, which induces Immunity IL-22-Mediated Systemic Elimination of Pathobiontsacute intestinal dysfunction through the production of epithelium-damaging toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB, respectively) (Kuehne et al., 2010), intestinal disease triggered by C. rodentium develops more slowly, and pathogen clearance is dependent on acquired immunity (Mundy et al., 2005). "
"19","disease","RESULTS IL-22-Deficient Mice Are More Susceptible to C. difficile Infection To assess the role of IL-22 in C. difficile-induced colitis, we infected antibiotic-treated mice with the pathogen that recapitulates many of the disease features observed in humans (Chen et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2011). "
"20","disease","Translocation of Specific Species of Pathobionts after C. difficile Infection Contributes to Lethality in IL-22Deficient Mice To investigate the role of individual bacterial species in C. difficile-induced disease, we further characterized the composition of the bacteria present in the liver of C. difficile-infected Il22/ mice and isolated dominant bacteria from the organs of C. difficile-infected mice to assess their pathogenicity. "
"21","disease","Therefore, our study highlights an important role for IL-22 in limiting pathobiont-induced systemic disease and identifies a mechanism by which pathobionts can evade host immunity. "
"22","disease","Our study highlights the importance of complement resistance in the pathogenesis of commensalmediated intestinal disease. "
"23","disease","The presence of commensals is important to suppress C. difficile expansion in the intestine, and elimination of competitive commensals by antibiotics results in overgrowth of C. difficile and C. difficile-infection-related disease (Carroll and Bartlett, 2011). "
"24","disease","However, some patients suffer relapsing disease that is refractory to standard antibiotic treatment. "
"25","disease","Transplantation of fecal microbiota from healthy donors has been shown to be effective for the prevention of disease recurrence (Koenigsknecht and Young, 2013; Lo Vecchio and Cohen, 2014). "
"26","disease","Because individual strains within the same species possess differential resistance against host elimination and can give rise to varying degrees of disease severity, it will be important to assess in detail the composition of the donor microbiota in fecal transplants to avoid transplanting potential pathobionts to patients already sickened by infection and dysbiosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Bacterial Strains C. difficile VPI10463 and E. coli K-12 were cultured as previously described (Hasegawa et al., 2012).
