"1","wild","InfectionwithC. difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22/ mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","To investigate the role of IL-22 in host protection during C. difficile infection, we assessed the survival of Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection and found strikingly higher mortality rates in Il22/ mice than in wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 1B). "
"3","mutant","InfectionwithC. difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22/ mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. "
"4","model","Previous studies have showna critical role for neutrophils in the elimination of translocated commensals at intestinal sites in the mouse model of C. difficile infection (Hasegawa et al., 2010; Hasegawa et al., 2012). "
"5","model","Thus, robust induction of IL-22 requires intestinal infection in the C. difficile infection model. "
"6","model","However, we found no significant differences between Il22/ mice and WT mice in the microbiota composition before or after C. difficile infection, suggesting that IL-22 does not regulate the composition of microbiota in all infection models. "
"7","model","In other infection models, IL-22 protects the host against pathogens via the induction of/ and WT mice infected or uninfected with C. difficile. "
"8","model","In the C. difficile infection model, IL-22 plays a critical role in complement-mediated elimination of pathobionts that have disseminated systemically, at least in part, by upregulating C3 expression. "
"9","model","In theC. difficile infection model, inflammasome-mediated IL-1b production is also critical for both local (intestinal) and systemic immune responses by facilitating neutrophil recruitment and promoting elimination of commensals after C. difficile infection (Hasegawa et al. "
"10","model","The elimination of commensals by antibiotics improves host survival after C. difficile infection in the mouse model, suggesting a potential therapeutic application. "
"11","model","Our study has shown that g-enterobacterial commensals as one of the dominant pathobionts responsible for complications of C. difficile infection in the mouse model. "
"12","model","A mouse model of Clostridium difficile-associated disease. "
