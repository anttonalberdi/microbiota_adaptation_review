"1","wild","InfectionwithC. difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22/ mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","To investigate the role of IL-22 in host protection during C. difficile infection, we assessed the survival of Il22/ mice after C. difficile infection and found strikingly higher mortality rates in Il22/ mice than in wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 1B). "
