"1","wild","Here, we used global positioning system collars to track wild giant pandas at high resolution (<10 m) and sampled foraging patches for nutritional hierarchical level analysis. "
"2","wild","However, with rapid advances in the functionality and operability of global positioning system (GPS) telemetry, it is now possible to precisely and quantitatively analyze spatial behavior and patch selection of free-ranging wildlife at fine spatial scales (Tomkiewicz et al., 2010; Middleton et al., 2013; Hays et al., 2014). "
"3","wild","Giant panda monitoring With approval from the State Forestry Administration in China, five wild giant pandas (three males and two females) were fitted with high frequency GPS/VHF radio collars (Lotek Wireless Inc., Ontario, Canada) (Table 1). "
"4","wild","Previous studies have demonstrated that giant pandas favor younger bamboo rather than old bamboo in the wild (Schaller et al., 1985; Zhang et al., 2009; Nie et al., 2015). "
"5","wild","These data contribute to herbivore forage patch selection mechanisms in heterogeneous habitats and have further specific implications for the management of giant pandas in the wild. "
"6","wild","The issue of small sample sizes is unavoidable in our research and we cannot eliminate this limitation by expanding the sample of wild giant pandas due to strict State Forestry Administration approval to fit five GPS/ VHF radio collars only. "
"7","wild","Given the importance of nutritional quality to giant panda foraging behavior and the role of understory bamboo, wildlife managers need to begin taking steps to ensure this crucial resource remains available under a changing climate. "
"8","wild","What determines selection and abandonment of a foraging patch by wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in winter? "
"9","fitness","Optimally foraging mice match patch use with habitat differences in fitness. "
"10","adaptation","This work will also contribute to our understanding of herbivore foraging optimization and adaptation to a nutritionally-challenged life history. "
"11","adaptation","Match and mismatch: conservation physiology, nutritional ecology and the timescales of biological adaptation. "
"12","adaptation","Whole-genome sequencing of giant pandas provides insights into demographic history and local adaptation. "
"13","model","We used random forest (RF) and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to infer habitat and nutritional factors that may influence foraging patch selection and utilization. "
"14","model","Foraging patch selection modeling Random forest (RF), a complex model of machine learning (Breiman, 2001a), was used to study the relationship between environment variables and patch utilization intensity. "
"15","model","It is robust to inclusion of irrelevant features, and produces inspectable models (Hastie et al., 2008). "
"16","model","RF provides all explanatory variable importance by measuring how much model performance declines if the variable is randomly permuted. "
"17","model","We used all 25 explanatory variables in the RF model to explain utilization intensity of giant pandas in each grid cell, ranked the importance of these variables, and demonstrated the partial effects of these variables on patch selection intensity. "
"18","model","In order to select the most representative variables in the next model analysis step, we used the following two criteria. "
"19","model","(1) RF model is responsible for screening out more important variables within all explanatory variables; (2) for the remaining variables with correlation coefficients >0.5 we only retained those variables with a clear biological meaning. "
"20","model","The specific process is that firstly we imported all 25 explanatory variables into the RF model, ranked the importance of these variables, and demonstrated the partial effects of these variables on foraging patch utilization intensity. "
"21","model","We used a generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) with an identity link and a Gaussian-error distribution to identify the effect of slope, slope aspect, canopy coverage, shrub cover, bamboo cover, bamboo density, open land proportion, crude protein, cellulose and nutritional quality ratio (crude protein/ (celluloses + lignin)), represent quality of bamboo resources; Schaller et al., 1985) on foraging patch utilization intensity. "
"22","model","Multimodel inference based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) was used to evaluate the relative importance of each predictor variable (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). "
"23","model","The global model set had all possible combinations of the ten predictor variables (total: 210  1 = 1023 models), and these models were ranked. "
"24","model","We estimated the relative importance of each explanatory variable by calculating AIC weights across all of the candidate models that included the variable under consideration. "
"25","model","We listed the top 10 models (with the lowest AICc values) and retained models that were within 2 AIC units (DAIC 6 2) of the top models to be highly supported. "
