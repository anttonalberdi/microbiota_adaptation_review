"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","Here, we used global positioning system collars to track wild giant pandas at high resolution (<10 m) and sampled foraging patches for nutritional hierarchical level analysis. "
"2","wild","However, with rapid advances in the functionality and operability of global positioning system (GPS) telemetry, it is now possible to precisely and quantitatively analyze spatial behavior and patch selection of free-ranging wildlife at fine spatial scales (Tomkiewicz et al., 2010; Middleton et al., 2013; Hays et al., 2014). "
"3","wild","Giant panda monitoring With approval from the State Forestry Administration in China, five wild giant pandas (three males and two females) were fitted with high frequency GPS/VHF radio collars (Lotek Wireless Inc., Ontario, Canada) (Table 1). "
"4","wild","Previous studies have demonstrated that giant pandas favor younger bamboo rather than old bamboo in the wild (Schaller et al., 1985; Zhang et al., 2009; Nie et al., 2015). "
"5","wild","These data contribute to herbivore forage patch selection mechanisms in heterogeneous habitats and have further specific implications for the management of giant pandas in the wild. "
"6","wild","The issue of small sample sizes is unavoidable in our research and we cannot eliminate this limitation by expanding the sample of wild giant pandas due to strict State Forestry Administration approval to fit five GPS/ VHF radio collars only. "
"7","wild","Given the importance of nutritional quality to giant panda foraging behavior and the role of understory bamboo, wildlife managers need to begin taking steps to ensure this crucial resource remains available under a changing climate. "
"8","wild","What determines selection and abandonment of a foraging patch by wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in winter? "
"9","fitness","Optimally foraging mice match patch use with habitat differences in fitness. "
"10","adaptation","This work will also contribute to our understanding of herbivore foraging optimization and adaptation to a nutritionally-challenged life history. "
"11","adaptation","Match and mismatch: conservation physiology, nutritional ecology and the timescales of biological adaptation. "
"12","adaptation","Whole-genome sequencing of giant pandas provides insights into demographic history and local adaptation. "
