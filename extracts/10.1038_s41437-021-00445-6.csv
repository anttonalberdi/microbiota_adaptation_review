"
"2","wild","To overcome these limitations, a growing number of studies have been describing the composition and function of symbiotic microbiota in wild animal populations. "
"3","wild","It has now been shown that GM are involved in modulation of a number of key ecophysiological and life-history traits in wild animal hosts and have the potential to increase their adaptation capacity (Alberdi et al. "
"4","wild","Some of these patterns have been further validated by transplantation of wild GM into experimental animal models (Sommer et al. "
"5","wild","As GM dysbiosis can have serious negative consequences on the viability of wild populations, there is an increasing need to integrate monitoring and maintenance of wildlifeassociated microbial diversity into management and conservation practices (Trevelline et al. "
"6","wild","Sampling of faecal microbiota (FM), on the other hand, has potential as a widely applicable non-invasive substitute of wildlife GM sampling (Zemanova 2019, 2020), assuming that it is feasible in the field and that FM constitutes a good proxy of GM. "
"7","wild","A profoundly important aspect of FM–GM resemblance for wildlife studies is that differences in microbiota composition and diversity between individuals must follow the same pattern when analysing faecal and intestinal microbiota. "
"8","wild","Some studies across or within wild species have evaluated consistency in FM vs. "
"9","wild","Under some circumstances, such as when sampling road kills or during targeted decreases in population density (e.g. invasive species or animal pests), direct sampling of wildlife intestinal microbiota is appropriate, or at least justifiable (Dubois et al. "
"10","wild","In a previous study, we showed that GM alphadiversity and GM inter-individual variability were similar in wild mice and mice from our breeding facility, despite the two groups clustering separately based on GM composition (Kreisinger et al. "
"11","wild","Importantly, the experimental setup allowed for us to control other variables, which would be hard to achieve in the wild. "
"12","wild","This resulted in a mixture of faeces ranging from 0 to 18-h old, as would be expected for over-night trapping in the wild. "
"13","wild","Our study extends this endeavour by searching for optimal strategies for hostassociated microbiota sampling in wild host populations. "
"14","wild","Considering that FM sampling does not require the death of the animals studied, however, we encourage researchers to use FM, at least in correlative, divergence-based GM studies in wild animals similar to the house mouse. "
"15","wild","We further suggest that future studies should pay more attention to comparisons of FM–GM alphadiversities in other wild-living species. "
