"1","wild","In a survey of laboratory-reared Drosophila and wild-captured flies, we found that Drosophila was naturally colonized by representatives of five bacterial phyla. "
"2","wild","They found that E. faecalis, E. faecium, and E. casseliflavus were associated with 32, 22.4, and 43.5%, respectively, of wild insect isolates in 37 different taxa, but they did not include Drosophila in their analysis. "
"3","wild","Quantification of cultivable bacteria and Enterococcus in laboratory-reared and wild-captured fly stocks. "
"4","wild","In order to increase the detection limit for identifying members of the Drosophila microbial consortium, pools of 10 flies each from the Oregon R Bloomington and Oregon R OU stocks and the wildcaptured stocks from Massachusetts (MA) and Oklahoma (OK) were rinsed with 70% ethanol for surface decontamination, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and homogenized with disposable pellet pestles (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in 500 l sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). "
"5","wild","To determine the fraction of phylotypes shared by our Drosophila 16S rRNA gene libraries, the microbial consortia of Oregon R OU, Oregon R Bloomington, and wild-captured MA fly stocks were compared using SONS (64) (http://www .plantpath.wisc.edu/fac/joh/sons.html). "
"6","wild","Drosophila adults, either from an unperturbed laboratorymaintained wild-type stock or artificially colonized with E. faecalis FA2-2, were fixed in 37% paraformaldehyde in water and octane, using a method developed by Richard Carthew, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL (personal communication). "
"7","wild","Single colonies of native enterococci and other organisms cultured from Drosophila (including species of Serratia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus from wild-captured and laboratory stocks, as well as E. faecalis FA2-2 as a control) were examined. "
"8","wild","A fourth library, constructed from randomly selected, PCR-amplified eubacterial 16S rRNA genes isolated from the wild-captured OK fly stock, was found to consist of only two phylotypes, an unidentified Wolbachia species (239 clones, 95.6%) and an unidentified Enterococcus species (11 clones, 4.4%). "
"9","wild","All clones of the Wolbachia phylotype identified in this analysis originated in wild-captured MA flies. "
"10","wild","Because the level of Wolbachia infection of the MA fly line did not preclude detection of other flora, we included this line in the analysis as a representative of Drosophila in the wild. "
"11","wild","The Shannon and Simpson indices of diversity were highest for the wild-captured MA stock, followed by Oregon R Bloomington; the lowest values were the values for Oregon R OU. "
"12","wild","Oregon R OU (red), Oregon R Bloomington (blue), and wild-captured MA (yellow) 16S rRNA gene libraries were compared using SONS. "

"
"14","wild","While it is not known why the percentage of Enterococcus clones was lower in wild-caught Drosophila than in laboratory-reared strains, it was observed that the GI tract microbiota of wild-captured flies had a greater level of diversity (Table 1); therefore, enterococci accounted for a FIG. "

"16","wild","The higher level of diversity seen in wild flies may have been the result of consumption of a diet that was more varied than the diet of laboratory-reared Drosophila stocks passaged on artificial fly food, which may not support some members of the microbiota normally associated with wild Drosophila. "
"17","wild","While the anatomical localization of the Drosophila microbiota has not been determined in its entirety, we observed by using immunohistochemical staining of thin sections (Fig. 8) that enterococci were consistently located only within the confines of the GI tract, suggesting that they represented a consistent component of the Drosophila GI tract consortium, irrespective of whether flies were reared in the laboratory or captured from the wild. "
"18","wild","Vodovar et al. (76) demonstrated that oral infection of Drosophila with the gram-negative -proteobacterium Pseudomonas entomophila resulted in 70% lethality in wild-type flies and induced a systemic immune response. "
"19","wild","Occurrence of enterococci in animals in a wild environment. "
"20","mutant","Killing curves were generated for each fly type-isogenic mutant strain pair. "
"21","model","To develop a tractable model for studying the roles of these organisms as commensals and pathogens, we characterized the Drosophila melanogaster microflora and examined the occurrence of enterococci in the gastrointestinal consortium of Drosophila. "
"22","model","Because enterococci have been reported to be commensal organisms of insects and because Drosophila is a genetically tractable model for studying host-pathogen interactions, it was of interest to characterize the microbial consortium of the fruit fly and to determine whether enterococci are a native component of that consortium. "
"23","model","Trees were constructed using a general time-reversible model using base frequency and substitution values and gamma distribution shape parameters indicated by Modeltest. "
"24","model","The tree was constructed with PAUP by neighbor-joining analysis using a general time-reversible model. "
"25","model","Since enterococcal cytolysin contributes to the severity of infection in all models tested so far (29, 38), this virulence factor was selected for testing in the Drosophila oral ingestion model. "
"26","model","As was the case in our study, the gypsy moth flora also lacked obligate anaerobic phylotypes, a fact that may be pertinent when the compositions of the various insect microbial consortia are compared to the composition of the human GI tract flora for the purposes of modeling colonization with clinically important human isolates. "
"27","model","Studies of enterococcal colonization and ecology in the GI tract using mammalian models (36, 37) have had limited success because of the complexity of the flora, animal-to-animal variation, and the possibility that lineages of enterococci may be host adapted (9). "
"28","model","Recently, Caenorhabditis elegans was used to screen traits of enterococci for virulence in this model (29). "
"29","model","Virulence properties known to be important in mammalian infection were verified in this model, but this model has limited value for studying host-commensal relationships in GI tract colonization, since C. elegans ingests bacteria as food. "
"30","model","The enterococcal cytolysin was of particular interest for study in this model because of its dual role as both a bacteriocin and a toxin. "
"31","model","Fly survival was significantly affected by colonization with the cytolytic strain, highlighting the utility of this model. "
"32","model","Drosophila has been used as a model organism in research for nearly a century (6). "
"33","model","Its genome has recently been sequenced (2), it has been utilized as a nonmammalian model for studying some aspects of infectious diseases (19, 20, 26, 57), and it possesses signaling systems governing its innate immune response that are functionally conserved in mammals (25, 41, 43, 44).

"
"41","disease","The fact that it is natively colonized with enterococci but has a simpler GI tract consortium suggests that it may be well suited for studies of the role of enterococci in a GI tract consortium and the mechanisms that underlie the ability to use the consortium as a springboard for causing disease. "
"42","disease","Hentges (ed.), Human intestinal microflora in health and disease. "
"43","environment","The open circulatory system of the fly (6), together with the small diameter of the Drosophila alimentary canal, which even at its greatest diameter (225 m [6]) does not exceed the diffusion limit of oxygen in tissue (140 m [46]) when it is considered that diffusion can occur from all sides, may account for the lack of anoxic environments in the Drosophila GI tract. "
"44","environment","Occurrence of enterococci in animals in a wild environment. "
"45","human","An estimated 500 taxa are represented among the bacterial species in the consortium in the human colon (23, 71, 72), and species representation in this consortium varies by age, diet, and genetics. "
"46","human","Enterococci are present naturally in the GI tracts of insects (8, 11, 49, 50, 70), reptiles (55), humans, and other mammals (1, 38, 55, 59). "
"47","human","Enterococci are minority members of the human GI tract consortium, comprising up to 1% of the adult microflora (65). "
"48","human","Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are the two species most commonly detected in the human bowel (27, 59, 72), while Enterococcus durans occurs in a small percentage of adults (72). "
"49","human","To examine the reassociation of Drosophila with E. faecalis, 1  109 cells of an E. faecalis strain, FA2-2, which was derived from a human clinical isolate (17) by selecting 1566 COX AND GILMORE INFECT. "
"50","human","We observed a small decrease in the survival of flies colonized with the cytolysin-negative E. faecalis strain (17% killed by day 4) compared to the survival of an antibioticonly control, which suggests that either perturbation of the flora followed by colonization with a human-derived E. faecalis strain or residual production of the cytolysin activator by the noncytolytic strain is deleterious to Drosophila. "
"51","human","As was the case in our study, the gypsy moth flora also lacked obligate anaerobic phylotypes, a fact that may be pertinent when the compositions of the various insect microbial consortia are compared to the composition of the human GI tract flora for the purposes of modeling colonization with clinically important human isolates. "
"52","human","The Drosophila microbial consortium is considerably less complex than the human GI tract flora. "
"53","human","Eckburg et al. (23) recently described a highly detailed analysis of the diversity of the human intestinal microbial flora. "
"54","human","The most numerous human intestinal phylotypes analyzed belonged to the Firmicutes (301 phylotypes, 76% of the total), and the vast majority (95% of Firmicutes and 69% of all phylotypes identified [274 phylotypes]) belonged to the largely anaerobic or microaerophilic clostridia. "
"55","human","The Bacteriodetes was the next most abundant phylum in the human intestinal microbial consortium (48% of the total, 65 phylotypes). "
"56","human","Conversely, human proteobacterial phylotypes were relatively scarce ( 0.1% of the total), while the Drosophila microbial consortium was composed of approximately 61% proteobacterial phylotypes. "
"57","human","As was the case with the Drosophila microbial consortium, the Actinobacteria also accounted for only a minor fraction of the human flora. "
"58","human","Differences between human GI tract anatomy and physiology and Drosophila GI tract anatomy and physiology undoubtedly play a role in determining the composition and physical location of the respective microbial populations. "
"59","human","Anatomically, the GI tract of Drosophila (6) has an overall organization that is comparable to that of humans. "
"60","human","In comparison, the human stomach is highly acidic, the intestine is neutral, and the colon is maintained at a pH gradient ranging from slightly acidic at the anterior end to neutral at the posterior end (22). "
"61","human","As discussed above, another major difference between the two GI tracts is the absence of obligate anaerobic phylotypes in Drosophila, while the majority of human intestinal microbial phylotypes observed were obligate or microaerophilic anaerobes (23). "
"62","human","Similarly, recent findings (33) suggest that enterococcal localization in the human GI tract is centered primarily in the small and large intestines, where enterococci are prominent members of the jejunal, ileal, cecal, and rectosigmoidal consortia. "
