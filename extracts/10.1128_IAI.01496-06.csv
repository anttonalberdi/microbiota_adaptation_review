"1","wild","In a survey of laboratory-reared Drosophila and wild-captured flies, we found that Drosophila was naturally colonized by representatives of five bacterial phyla. "
"2","wild","They found that E. faecalis, E. faecium, and E. casseliflavus were associated with 32, 22.4, and 43.5%, respectively, of wild insect isolates in 37 different taxa, but they did not include Drosophila in their analysis. "
"3","wild","Quantification of cultivable bacteria and Enterococcus in laboratory-reared and wild-captured fly stocks. "
"4","wild","In order to increase the detection limit for identifying members of the Drosophila microbial consortium, pools of 10 flies each from the Oregon R Bloomington and Oregon R OU stocks and the wildcaptured stocks from Massachusetts (MA) and Oklahoma (OK) were rinsed with 70% ethanol for surface decontamination, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and homogenized with disposable pellet pestles (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in 500 l sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). "
"5","wild","To determine the fraction of phylotypes shared by our Drosophila 16S rRNA gene libraries, the microbial consortia of Oregon R OU, Oregon R Bloomington, and wild-captured MA fly stocks were compared using SONS (64) (http://www .plantpath.wisc.edu/fac/joh/sons.html). "
"6","wild","Drosophila adults, either from an unperturbed laboratorymaintained wild-type stock or artificially colonized with E. faecalis FA2-2, were fixed in 37% paraformaldehyde in water and octane, using a method developed by Richard Carthew, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL (personal communication). "
"7","wild","Single colonies of native enterococci and other organisms cultured from Drosophila (including species of Serratia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus from wild-captured and laboratory stocks, as well as E. faecalis FA2-2 as a control) were examined. "
"8","wild","A fourth library, constructed from randomly selected, PCR-amplified eubacterial 16S rRNA genes isolated from the wild-captured OK fly stock, was found to consist of only two phylotypes, an unidentified Wolbachia species (239 clones, 95.6%) and an unidentified Enterococcus species (11 clones, 4.4%). "
"9","wild","All clones of the Wolbachia phylotype identified in this analysis originated in wild-captured MA flies. "
"10","wild","Because the level of Wolbachia infection of the MA fly line did not preclude detection of other flora, we included this line in the analysis as a representative of Drosophila in the wild. "
"11","wild","The Shannon and Simpson indices of diversity were highest for the wild-captured MA stock, followed by Oregon R Bloomington; the lowest values were the values for Oregon R OU. "
"12","wild","Oregon R OU (red), Oregon R Bloomington (blue), and wild-captured MA (yellow) 16S rRNA gene libraries were compared using SONS. "

"
"14","wild","While it is not known why the percentage of Enterococcus clones was lower in wild-caught Drosophila than in laboratory-reared strains, it was observed that the GI tract microbiota of wild-captured flies had a greater level of diversity (Table 1); therefore, enterococci accounted for a FIG. "

"16","wild","The higher level of diversity seen in wild flies may have been the result of consumption of a diet that was more varied than the diet of laboratory-reared Drosophila stocks passaged on artificial fly food, which may not support some members of the microbiota normally associated with wild Drosophila. "
"17","wild","While the anatomical localization of the Drosophila microbiota has not been determined in its entirety, we observed by using immunohistochemical staining of thin sections (Fig. 8) that enterococci were consistently located only within the confines of the GI tract, suggesting that they represented a consistent component of the Drosophila GI tract consortium, irrespective of whether flies were reared in the laboratory or captured from the wild. "
"18","wild","Vodovar et al. (76) demonstrated that oral infection of Drosophila with the gram-negative -proteobacterium Pseudomonas entomophila resulted in 70% lethality in wild-type flies and induced a systemic immune response. "
