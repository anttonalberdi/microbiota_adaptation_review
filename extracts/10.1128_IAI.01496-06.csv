"1","wild","In a survey of laboratory-reared Drosophila and wild-captured flies, we found that Drosophila was naturally colonized by representatives of five bacterial phyla. "
"2","wild","They found that E. faecalis, E. faecium, and E. casseliflavus were associated with 32, 22.4, and 43.5%, respectively, of wild insect isolates in 37 different taxa, but they did not include Drosophila in their analysis. "
"3","wild","Quantification of cultivable bacteria and Enterococcus in laboratory-reared and wild-captured fly stocks. "
"4","wild","In order to increase the detection limit for identifying members of the Drosophila microbial consortium, pools of 10 flies each from the Oregon R Bloomington and Oregon R OU stocks and the wildcaptured stocks from Massachusetts (MA) and Oklahoma (OK) were rinsed with 70% ethanol for surface decontamination, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and homogenized with disposable pellet pestles (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in 500 l sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). "
"5","wild","To determine the fraction of phylotypes shared by our Drosophila 16S rRNA gene libraries, the microbial consortia of Oregon R OU, Oregon R Bloomington, and wild-captured MA fly stocks were compared using SONS (64) (http://www .plantpath.wisc.edu/fac/joh/sons.html). "
"6","wild","Drosophila adults, either from an unperturbed laboratorymaintained wild-type stock or artificially colonized with E. faecalis FA2-2, were fixed in 37% paraformaldehyde in water and octane, using a method developed by Richard Carthew, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL (personal communication). "
"7","wild","Single colonies of native enterococci and other organisms cultured from Drosophila (including species of Serratia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus from wild-captured and laboratory stocks, as well as E. faecalis FA2-2 as a control) were examined. "
"8","wild","A fourth library, constructed from randomly selected, PCR-amplified eubacterial 16S rRNA genes isolated from the wild-captured OK fly stock, was found to consist of only two phylotypes, an unidentified Wolbachia species (239 clones, 95.6%) and an unidentified Enterococcus species (11 clones, 4.4%). "
"9","wild","All clones of the Wolbachia phylotype identified in this analysis originated in wild-captured MA flies. "
"10","wild","Because the level of Wolbachia infection of the MA fly line did not preclude detection of other flora, we included this line in the analysis as a representative of Drosophila in the wild. "
"11","wild","The Shannon and Simpson indices of diversity were highest for the wild-captured MA stock, followed by Oregon R Bloomington; the lowest values were the values for Oregon R OU. "
"12","wild","Oregon R OU (red), Oregon R Bloomington (blue), and wild-captured MA (yellow) 16S rRNA gene libraries were compared using SONS. "

"
"14","wild","While it is not known why the percentage of Enterococcus clones was lower in wild-caught Drosophila than in laboratory-reared strains, it was observed that the GI tract microbiota of wild-captured flies had a greater level of diversity (Table 1); therefore, enterococci accounted for a FIG. "

"16","wild","The higher level of diversity seen in wild flies may have been the result of consumption of a diet that was more varied than the diet of laboratory-reared Drosophila stocks passaged on artificial fly food, which may not support some members of the microbiota normally associated with wild Drosophila. "
"17","wild","While the anatomical localization of the Drosophila microbiota has not been determined in its entirety, we observed by using immunohistochemical staining of thin sections (Fig. 8) that enterococci were consistently located only within the confines of the GI tract, suggesting that they represented a consistent component of the Drosophila GI tract consortium, irrespective of whether flies were reared in the laboratory or captured from the wild. "
"18","wild","Vodovar et al. (76) demonstrated that oral infection of Drosophila with the gram-negative -proteobacterium Pseudomonas entomophila resulted in 70% lethality in wild-type flies and induced a systemic immune response. "
"19","wild","Occurrence of enterococci in animals in a wild environment. "
"20","mutant","Killing curves were generated for each fly type-isogenic mutant strain pair. "
"21","model","To develop a tractable model for studying the roles of these organisms as commensals and pathogens, we characterized the Drosophila melanogaster microflora and examined the occurrence of enterococci in the gastrointestinal consortium of Drosophila. "
"22","model","Because enterococci have been reported to be commensal organisms of insects and because Drosophila is a genetically tractable model for studying host-pathogen interactions, it was of interest to characterize the microbial consortium of the fruit fly and to determine whether enterococci are a native component of that consortium. "
"23","model","Trees were constructed using a general time-reversible model using base frequency and substitution values and gamma distribution shape parameters indicated by Modeltest. "
"24","model","The tree was constructed with PAUP by neighbor-joining analysis using a general time-reversible model. "
"25","model","Since enterococcal cytolysin contributes to the severity of infection in all models tested so far (29, 38), this virulence factor was selected for testing in the Drosophila oral ingestion model. "
"26","model","As was the case in our study, the gypsy moth flora also lacked obligate anaerobic phylotypes, a fact that may be pertinent when the compositions of the various insect microbial consortia are compared to the composition of the human GI tract flora for the purposes of modeling colonization with clinically important human isolates. "
"27","model","Studies of enterococcal colonization and ecology in the GI tract using mammalian models (36, 37) have had limited success because of the complexity of the flora, animal-to-animal variation, and the possibility that lineages of enterococci may be host adapted (9). "
"28","model","Recently, Caenorhabditis elegans was used to screen traits of enterococci for virulence in this model (29). "
"29","model","Virulence properties known to be important in mammalian infection were verified in this model, but this model has limited value for studying host-commensal relationships in GI tract colonization, since C. elegans ingests bacteria as food. "
"30","model","The enterococcal cytolysin was of particular interest for study in this model because of its dual role as both a bacteriocin and a toxin. "
"31","model","Fly survival was significantly affected by colonization with the cytolytic strain, highlighting the utility of this model. "
"32","model","Drosophila has been used as a model organism in research for nearly a century (6). "
"33","model","Its genome has recently been sequenced (2), it has been utilized as a nonmammalian model for studying some aspects of infectious diseases (19, 20, 26, 57), and it possesses signaling systems governing its innate immune response that are functionally conserved in mammals (25, 41, 43, 44).
