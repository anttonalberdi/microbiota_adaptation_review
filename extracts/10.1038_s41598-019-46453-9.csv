"1","wild","Antúnez1 Honeybees Apis mellifera are important pollinators of wild plants and commercial crops. "
"2","wild","In particular, honeybees (Apis mellifera) are among the most important insect pollinator in temperate and tropical areas, promoting the sexual reproduction of wild plants and commercial crops5,6. "

"4","model","Eucalyptus spp. plantations provide an ideal natural model to study the impact of nutritional stress on honeybee health since its pollen has a low crude protein percentage33,35, low lipid content36 and is deficient in isoleucine35,37. "
"5","model","Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to assess the relationship between time/treatment and colony strength/pathogen infection. "
"6","model","Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to assess the relationship between treatment (M or P) and time (both as fixed effects), and colony strength and pathogen infection levels 9Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:10156 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46453-9 www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/ (as dependent variables) (package {lme4})82,83. "
"7","model","The identity of the colonies was considered as a random effect, and random intercept or slope was chosen in each model according to the variability of each dependent variable intra and inter colony, respectively. "
"8","model","A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR. "
"9","disease","Omega 3 is an essential fatty acid which deficiencies are associated with diseases and neurological disorders43,44. "
"10","disease","Beepath: An ordered quantitative-PCR array for exploring honey bee immunity and disease. "
"11","environment","These contrasting results highlight the complex relationship between the parasite and the host and the effects of the social environment of the colony. "
"12","environment","The polyfloral pollen patty showed a higher proportion of amino acids than pollen available in the environment (Supplementary Table S2). "
"13","environment","Colonies from group P consumed pollen available in the environment and the polyfloral pollen patty, while colonies from group M consumed only pollen available in the environment. "
"14","environment","Finally, since colonies were re-located in a favorable environment for bees after the nutritional stress period, it is not possible to discard that nutritional stress could have consequences on colony survival if they remained in the E. grandis environment. "
"15","environment","To identify and characterize pollen available in the environment, three honeybee colonies (not belonging to the study) were positioned next to the experimental apiary with pollen traps at the entrance. "
"16","environment","Since colonies become notably weaker if they are not removed from E. grandis environments during winter33, all the colonies were relocated to the experimental station of INIA La Estanzuela, once the flowering period ended (34° 20′ 23.72″S–57° 41′ 39.48″W). "
"17","environment","R: A language and environment for statistical computing (2017). "
"18","laboratory","Those results contrasts with laboratory studies, where bees fed with pollen have higher infection levels of Nosema spp. although survive longer than bees fed with syrup and no protein20,21,34. "
"19","laboratory","It suggests that under laboratory conditions increased nutritional resources promote Nosema spp. replication, but the beneficial effects of nutrition on honeybee physiology surpass the adverse effects of the infection. "
"20","laboratory","These results contrast with those obtained under laboratory conditions. "
"21","laboratory","In experiments performed under laboratory conditions, bees do not experience behavioral transition (because they do not have this possibility), but their physiology changes in association with nutrition47,48. "
"22","laboratory","Thus, in samplings performed in the laboratory at specific time points, bees fed with different diets are in different nutritional and physiological states. "
"23","laboratory","Crude protein and amino acid composition of honey bee-collected pollen pellets from south-east Australia and a note on laboratory disparity. "
