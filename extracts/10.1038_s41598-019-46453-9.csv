"4","model","Eucalyptus spp. plantations provide an ideal natural model to study the impact of nutritional stress on honeybee health since its pollen has a low crude protein percentage33,35, low lipid content36 and is deficient in isoleucine35,37. "
"5","model","Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to assess the relationship between time/treatment and colony strength/pathogen infection. "
"6","model","Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to assess the relationship between treatment (M or P) and time (both as fixed effects), and colony strength and pathogen infection levels 9Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:10156 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46453-9 www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/ (as dependent variables) (package {lme4})82,83.
