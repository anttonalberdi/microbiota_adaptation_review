"
"3","wild","For instance, observations of a shared (core) microbiome between wild and laboratory-raised zebrafish suggest that distinct selective pressures determine the composition of the microbial communities (14). "
"4","wild","It therefore remains unclear whether the microbial composition for a range of wild fish species is characterized by intraor interspecific divergence. "
"5","wild","Our findings have several implications for our understanding of the composition of the intestinal microbiome in wild fish populations. "
"6","wild","Although species-specific selection has been proposed as a factor driving the composition of the intestinal community in fish in a variety of settings (13, 14, 16–19, 29, 33), our results show that this may not be the most important driver among gadoid species in wild populations. "
"7","wild","Brachyspira spp. are known as intestinal pathogens in pigs and humans (68, 69), although recent studies show that Brachyspira spp. are more widespread in the wildlife community than previously thought, including in freshwater (70). "
"8","wild","Indeed, studies of wild-type zebrafish and knockout zebrafish without a functional adaptive immune system suggest that adaptive immunity increases the strength of host filtering of potential fish-associated microbes (22). "
"9","wild","All fish specimens were collected from wild populations. "
"10","adaptation","Atlantic cod comprises various subpopulations and “ecotypes” with distinct adaptations, migratory behavior, and feeding behavior. "
"11","adaptation","These ecotypes have increased genomic divergence in several large chromosomal inversions (43–47), suggestive of local adaptation. "
