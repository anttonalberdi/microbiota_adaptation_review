"
"3","wild","For instance, observations of a shared (core) microbiome between wild and laboratory-raised zebrafish suggest that distinct selective pressures determine the composition of the microbial communities (14). "
"4","wild","It therefore remains unclear whether the microbial composition for a range of wild fish species is characterized by intraor interspecific divergence. "
"5","wild","Our findings have several implications for our understanding of the composition of the intestinal microbiome in wild fish populations. "
"6","wild","Although species-specific selection has been proposed as a factor driving the composition of the intestinal community in fish in a variety of settings (13, 14, 16–19, 29, 33), our results show that this may not be the most important driver among gadoid species in wild populations. "

"12","model","Individual variation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II correlates with the gut microbiome composition in stickleback (20); mucosal IgT depletion causes dysbiosis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (21); and lack of a functional adaptive immune system reduces the strength of host selection in knockout zebrafish models (22).

"
"20","environment","The absence of consistent species-specific microbiomes suggests that external environmental factors, such as temperature, diet, or a combination thereof, comprise major drivers of the intestinal community composition of codfishes. "
"21","environment","KEYWORDS Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, codfishes, intestinal microbiome, metagenomics Significant research effort has focused on the importance of external, environmentalfactors (e.g., habitat, geography, microbial biodiversity, diet, water temperature, or salinity) and internal, host-related factors (e.g., genetics, physiology or immunity) in driving the composition of the intestinal microbiome in fish (1, 2). "
"22","environment","The environments that these two ecotypes encounter are different, and they feed on distinct types of food. "
"23","environment","In contrast, if environmental factors are the main drivers for the intestinal communities, we expect significant compositional differences between the ecotypes of Atlantic cod, as well as various levels of differentiation between the species. "
"24","environment","These results suggest that NCC and Norway pout occupy an environmental niche that allows bacterial members with a broad geographical distribution to colonize their intestinal communities. "
"25","environment","Nonetheless, because these different environmental and behavioral factors are correlated, it is unclear which of these parameters contributes the most to the observed differences in the intestinal microbiome composition between these ecotypes. "
"26","environment","In line with Riiser et al. (30), this study shows that such strain-level differences cannot be detected using 16S rRNA techniques alone, and that metagenomic shotgun sequencing is currently the most accurate approach to detect strain-level spatial variation in the marine environment. "
"27","environment","The ecology of Brachyspira in the marine environment is unclear, although an association with the carnivorous diet of mahi mahi and NEAC may suggest that the diet of northern silvery pout also has a considerable carnivorous component. "
