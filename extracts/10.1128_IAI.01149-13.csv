"1","wild","Previously we reported that when streptomycin-treated miceare fed wild-type Escherichia coli MG1655, the intestine selects for nonmotile flhDC deletion mutants (1, 2) and envZ missense mutants (3), both of which are better colonizers than the wild type. "

"4","wild","The E. coli MG1655 envZ gene was replaced with the E. coli Nissle 1917 wild-type envZ gene by an unpublished allelic replacement strategy developed by Barry Wanner and Kiryl Datsenko at Purdue University, as described previously (3). "

"7","wild","Therefore, despite the two amino acid differences between the wild-type envZ genes of E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli MG1655, the E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene conferred no colonization advantage to E. coli MG1655. "

"19","wild","The hypothesis that the better colonizing ability of E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was due to the envZP41L gene was supported by the fact that when the envZP41L gene in E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L was replaced with the wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 envZ gene, the restored E. coli Nissle 1917 and wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 strains had identical colonizing abilities (P 0.16) (Fig. "

"25","wild","If so, then it is not surprising that when E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L and wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 are fed to mice in equal numbers, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L is the better colonizer (Fig. "

"27","wild","However, it is surprising that when mice are fed wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L at a ratio of 10 5:1, E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L uses galactose to grow to larger numbers (Fig. "
"28","wild","5D and 6A), despite wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 being able to grow faster than E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L on galactose in vitro (Table 3). "
"29","wild","This can be explained if E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L uses galactose to grow in a second niche that wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 cannot colonize. "
"30","wild","Alternatively, that second niche could be another mixed biofilm that contains an anaerobe that makes a bacteriocin that inhibits wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 growth more than it inhibits E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L growth, much in the same way that E. coli Nissle 1917 is more sensitive than wild-type E. coli Nissle 1917 to colicin V (Table 2). "
"31","wild","Moreover, occupation of the galactose niche gives E. coli Nissle 1917 envZP41L a colonization advantage, despite its growing more slowly on galactose than the wild type in vitro. "
