"3","wild","Growing rnf-5(tm794) deletion mutant in media containing the ER stress inducer tunicamycin resulted in a better ability of the mutant animals to develop to L4 larvae and adults when compared to wild type animals. "

"15","wild","Likewise, it extended the lifespan and improved the recovery of L1 larvae from starvation in ire-1 deficient animals, with only a slight effect on wild-type animals. "
"16","wild","In contrast in conditions where autophagy levels are increased (for example when exposed to high concentrations of tunicamycin or in aging or L1-arrested wild-type animals), a further increase in autophagy levels may not have an added value for the organism. "

"26","adaptat","While autophagy occurs at a basal constitutive level to mediate global turnover of cytoplasmic materials [17], it can be further induced in response to nutrient deprivation and prevents amino acid insufficiency as well as energy production, both of which are essential for survival and adaptation to starvation [18,19]. "
"27","mutant","To better understand the function of RNF-5 under ER-stress conditions, we studied the ability of Caenorhabditis elegans rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals to cope with stress in the background of impaired UPR machinery. "
"28","mutant","We demonstrate that downregulation of RNF-5 decreased sensitivity to tunicamycin both in wild type and in an ire-1 mutant. "
"29","mutant","Double-mutant rnf-5;ire-1 animals showed increased starvation resistance and extended lifespan when compared to the ire-1 mutant. "
"30","mutant","In normal growth conditions ire-1 mutant animals develop slowly [7,8], exhibit impaired secretory protein metabolism[9], have a shortened lifespan [10] and fail to recover from starvation-induced developmental arrest [11]. "
"31","mutant","One of the most established substrates of the mammalian RNF5 is the ERAD substrate CFTRΔF508, a mutant form of CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) [37,40-42]. "
"32","mutant","We show that downregulation of RNF-5 increased ER stress resistance and partially rescued ire-1 mutant animals in an autophagy-dependent manner. "
"33","mutant","Results Increased ER stress resistance of rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals We have previously demonstrated that RNF-5 is a negative regulator of autophagy both in C. elegans and mammalian systems through its regulation of ATG4B [47]. "
"34","mutant","Growing rnf-5(tm794) deletion mutant in media containing the ER stress inducer tunicamycin resulted in a better ability of the mutant animals to develop to L4 larvae and adults when compared to wild type animals. "
"35","mutant","This data suggests that downregulation of RNF5 increase resistance to ER stress depends on functional autophagy. rnf-5 knockout partially rescues the ire-1 mutant animals with impaired UPR To elucidate the association between elevated ER stress resistance and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals we next analyzed mutants with impaired UPR. "
"36","mutant","We examined the ability of rnf-5;ire-1 double mutants to develop in the presence of tunicamycin. "
"37","mutant","While 70±2.5% of AC CE PT ED M AN US CR IP T ire-1(v33) mutant animals developed to L4 and adults in DMSO control plates, only 60±3.5% developed in mild ER stress (1 µg/ml tunicamycin). "

"39","mutant","Similarly, we examined the ability of rnf-5; ire-1 double mutants to recover from a prolonged heat shock, which is associated with proteostasis stress in various cellular organelles including the ER. "
"40","mutant","We performed heat shock experiments on WT, rnf-5 and ire-1 single mutant and ire-1;rnf-5 double mutants (Fig. "
"41","mutant","Surprisingly, under acute heat shock conditions (37°C for 5 h 30 min), we found that rnf-5 mutant animals showed a trend of higher sensitivity to heat shock compared to WT. "
"42","mutant","We hypothesize that the basal high levels of autophagy in rnf-5 mutant animals along with the additional induction of autophagy by heat shock conditions probably resulted in excessive autophagy, leading to lower thermoresistance. "
"43","mutant","In contrast, ire-1; rnf-5 double mutants showed increased thermo-resistance compared to single mutants and to WT animals. "
"44","mutant","Different mutants exhibit difference in starvation survival, for example daf-2 mutants survive longer in starvation than wild type [53,54] and IRE-1 is essential for recovery from L1 arrest [11]. "

"47","mutant","In contrast to ire-1(v33), double mutant with rnf-5(tm794) did not improve the atg-3(bp412) phenotype suggesting that functional autophagy is required for rescuing the starved L1s (Fig. "

"52","mutant","In addition, downregulation of autophagy did not further decrease ire-1 mutant lifespan (Fig. "
"53","mutant","Importantly, we find that autophagy is required for the extension of ire-1 mutant lifespan by downregulation of RNF-5 as the triple mutant atg-3(bp412);rnf-5(tm794);ire-1(v33) had a shorter lifespan (10.5±0.3 days) when compared to rnf-5;ire-1 double mutant (Fig. "

"55","mutant","Knockout of rnf-5 improved ER function in ire-1 mutant animals IRE-1 plays a central role in secretory protein metabolism also under normal growth conditions [9]. "
"56","mutant","To better understand how downregulation of RNF-5 affects protein secretion in ire-1 mutant animals we analyzed the daf-28p::DAF-28::GFP reporter [60,61]. "
"57","mutant","As previously described [9], in ire-1 mutant worms the reporter accumulates in the producing cells leading to relatively high signal in the anterior sensory neurons and posterior intestine. "
"58","mutant","In these animals, the DAF-28::GFP reporter is not secreted from the producing cells due to abnormal ER function in ire-1 mutant and therefore there is only a low signal in the body cavity. "
"59","mutant","However, we find that in ire-1;rnf-5 double mutants more than 80% of the animals had DAF-28::GFP fluorescence in the body cavity (Fig. "
"60","mutant","4A-B) suggesting an increased secretion of the DAF28::GFP from the producing cells, but no clearance by the coelomocytes (coelomocytes are present in ire-1 mutants, but are dysfunctional [9]). "
"61","mutant","We could not detect a difference in the fluorescence in the sensory neurons, which remained high in rnf-5; ire-1 double mutants (Fig. "
"62","mutant","A similar rescue pattern (i.e. rescue of secretion of the reporter from the intestine producing cells, but not from the producing neuronal cells, and lack of rescue of coelomocyte activity) has been observed in the insulin/IGF-1 receptor daf-2 mutants [62]. "
"63","mutant","Increased levels of lysosomal proteases in rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals To identify downstream elements regulated by RNF-5, we performed a quantitative proteomic profiling of wild type and rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals under mild ER stress induced by 1µg/ml tunicamycin. "
"64","mutant","Because many of these hydrolases were shown to be involved in lysosomal function and autophagy also in C. elegans [34] it is possible that RNF-5 regulates the levels of these components through a lysosomal or authophagy central regulator and therefore their levels are increased in rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals. "
"65","mutant","To examine the lysosomes in rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals we stained animals with LysoTracker Red DND-99 and analyzed the region of the anterior intestine, immediately posterior to the pharyngealintestinal valve. "
"66","mutant","Quantification of the lysosomes showed significant increase in lysosome number as well as significant decrease in lysosome size suggesting an increase in newly formed lysosomes in rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals when compared to WT. "
"67","mutant","Quantification of the lysosomes in ire-1(v33) revealed weaker staining and smaller number of lysosomes AC CE PT ED M AN US CR IP T that was rescued in the double mutant rnf-5(tm794); ire-1(v33). "
"68","mutant","As expected, rnf-5 mutant animals exhibited higher lysosomal activity while ire-1 mutant animals showed low activity as evidenced by reduced fluorescence. "
"69","mutant","Importantly, the cathepsin B activity was increased in ire-1; rnf-5 double mutants compared to ire-1 single mutants mainly in the anterior and posterior intestine, but not to the level of WT (Fig. "
"70","mutant","Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that RNF-5 depletion was less beneficial in improving the physiology of ire-1 mutants in a starvation recovery assay and in a lifespan assay, in the background of the autophagy hypomorph atg-3(bp412). "
"71","mutant","We demonstrated that downregulation of RNF-5 increased survival of ire-1 mutant animals following starvation and extended ire-1 mutant lifespan if the autophagy system remains intact. "
"72","mutant","Using the DAF-28::GFP model for protein secretion we demonstrated that downregulation of RNF-5 rescued intestinal protein secretion in ire-1 mutant animals. "
"73","mutant","In ire-1 mutants we observed weak staining of the lysosomes suggesting increased lysosomal pH/impaired lysosome acidification or abnormal retention properties inside the organelle. "
"74","mutant","This inefficient staining was rescued in the double mutant rnf-5(tm794); ire-1(v33). "
"75","mutant","We confirmed that rnf-5 mutant animals have higher lysosomal protease activity as predicted by the proteomics data. "
"76","mutant","At least three independent experiments were performed for each tunicamycin concentration, RNAi clone or mutant. "
