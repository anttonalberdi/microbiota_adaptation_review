"1","wild","We demonstrate that downregulation of RNF-5 decreased sensitivity to tunicamycin both in wild type and in an ire-1 mutant. "
"2","wild","Abbreviations ATG: autophagy; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD: ER-associated protein degradation; RNF5: RING finger protein 5; UPR: unfolded protein response; WT: wild-type Key Words autophagy, C. elegans, endoplasmic reticulum, IRE1, lysosome, RMA1, RNF5 AC CE PT ED M AN US CR IP T Introduction Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is caused primarily by an increase in misfolded protein load in the ER. "
"3","wild","Growing rnf-5(tm794) deletion mutant in media containing the ER stress inducer tunicamycin resulted in a better ability of the mutant animals to develop to L4 larvae and adults when compared to wild type animals. "
"4","wild","This rescue was limited to mild ER stress (tunicamycin ≤2 µg/ml) as rnf-5(tm794) animals exhibited similar sensitivity as wild type animals in tunicamycin concentrations of ≥3 µg/ml resulting in developmental arrest (Fig. "
"5","wild","Both wild-type and rnf-5(tm794) animals became more sensitive to tunicamycin following atg-4.1, atg-4.2, bec-1, atg-7 and lgg-1 RNAi (Fig. "
"6","wild","In general, rnf-5(tm794) showed higher resistance compared to wild type in most of the conditions, but when lgg-1 was downregulated or both atg-4.1 (ortholog to the human ATG4A and ATG4B) and atg-4.2 (ortholog to the human ATG4C) were codownregulated, rnf-5(tm794) animals lost their resistance and showed sensitivity similar to wild-type animals. "
"7","wild","Different mutants exhibit difference in starvation survival, for example daf-2 mutants survive longer in starvation than wild type [53,54] and IRE-1 is essential for recovery from L1 arrest [11]. "
"8","wild","While wild type and rnf-5(tm794) animals resumed development after 21.8±0.2 and 23.3±0.2 days of starvation respectively, ire-1(v33) mutant animals accumulated dead cell vacuoles (Fig. "
"9","wild","We conclude that autophagy contributes to the rescue of ire-1;rnf-5 double mutant ability to overcome L1 starvation. rnf-5 knockout increases the lifespan of ire-1 mutant animals The lifespan of ire-1(v33) animals is much shorter (9.4±0.3 days) when compared to wild type and rnf5(tm794) (20±0.5 and 21.1±0.5 days, respectively), but in double mutant rnf-5(tm794);ire-1(v33) the lifespan was extended to 12.5±0.3 days (Fig. "
"10","wild","In wild-type animals DAF-28::GFP is produced in several anterior sensory neurons and in the posterior intestine and secreted to the coelom. "
"11","wild","In wild-type animals, a GFP signal is detected in anterior sensory neurons, the posterior intestine and in coelomocytes. "
"12","wild","Increased levels of lysosomal proteases in rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals To identify downstream elements regulated by RNF-5, we performed a quantitative proteomic profiling of wild type and rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals under mild ER stress induced by 1µg/ml tunicamycin. "
"13","wild","Our analysis identified 44 proteins with higher levels in rnf-5(tm794) animals compared to wild-type animals and 4 proteins with lower levels (Fig. "
"14","wild","Interestingly, when compared to wild-type animals, knockout of rnf-5 was not beneficial in all the conditions tested. "
"15","wild","Likewise, it extended the lifespan and improved the recovery of L1 larvae from starvation in ire-1 deficient animals, with only a slight effect on wild-type animals. "
"16","wild","In contrast in conditions where autophagy levels are increased (for example when exposed to high concentrations of tunicamycin or in aging or L1-arrested wild-type animals), a further increase in autophagy levels may not have an added value for the organism. "
"17","wild","Interestingly, there was a major decrease in the levels of Aurora-A kinase AIR-1 (Table S4, red) in rnf-5(tm794) animals when compared to wild-type. "
"18","wild","(A) N2 (wild-type) and rnf-5(tm794) embryos were treated with the indicated concentrations of tunicamycin. "
"19","wild","(B) Survival rates of atg-3 single mutant and atg-3;rnf-5 double mutant are lower than wild-type and rnf-5 single mutant. "
"20","wild","(B) Lifespan of atg-3 single mutant and atg-3;rnf-5 double mutant is shorter compared to wild-type and rnf-5 single mutant. "
"21","wild","(A) Protein-protein interactions for differentially expressed proteins identified in a proteomics screen of rnf5(tm794) and wild type animals grown on 1 µg/ml Tunicamycin (mild ER stress). "
"22","wild","AIR-1 (labeled with asterisk) was downregulated in rnf-5(tm794) mutant worms compared to wild type. "
"23","wild","(C) Representative fluorescence micrographs of day-1 adult wild type, rnf-5(tm794), ire-1(v33) and rnf5(tm794);ire-1(v33) animals stained with LysoTracker Red DND-99. "

"26","adaptation","While autophagy occurs at a basal constitutive level to mediate global turnover of cytoplasmic materials [17], it can be further induced in response to nutrient deprivation and prevents amino acid insufficiency as well as energy production, both of which are essential for survival and adaptation to starvation [18,19].
