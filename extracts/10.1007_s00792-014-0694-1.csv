"1","wild","The highest ecological diversity (Shannon’s index, H’) was found in brines, it decreased in the gut of wild and laboratory animals, and in laboratory water. "
"2","wild","Significant differences in H’ existed between brines and laboratory water, and between brines and gut of wild animals. "
"3","wild","These samples allowed comparisons between the following three types of environments: (a) field, water (brine) samples from natural locations (F_W); (b) laboratory, water samples (L_W) from laboratory-reared Artemia cultures; (c) gut, corresponds to the microbiota assessed in the digestive tube of wild (F_G) and laboratory-reared animals (L_G). "
"4","wild","Laboratory cultures were established from wild Artemia animals collected from each location, except for Laguna de los Cisnes (LAC) where only cysts were available at sampling, as explained below. "
"5","wild","Albeit partially, this means wild Artemia individuals tend to reflect the bacterial diversity of the environment they inhabit, be it nature or laboratory, a finding consistent with the fact that bacterial colonization of the gut is facilitated by the non-selective filter feeder nature of Artemia. "
"6","wild","It is interesting though to highlight that gut of wild-collected animals maintains a fraction of the natural diversity and, in some cases, bacteria not found in the water. "
"7","wild","For example, Sphingomonas (Alphaproteobacteria) was exclusively found in the gut of wild Artemia individuals, a genus reported to have the ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), b Fig. "
"8","wild","Chromohalobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) was mainly identified in the gut of wild Artemia collected in north, center and south Chile, but also in some cultured animals. "
"9","fitness","The recognition that microorganisms are ubiquitous to almost every environment, and able to establish different types of association, such as mutualism or parasitism (Fraune and Bosch 2010; Toft and Andersson 2010), led us to assume they should affect Artemia fitness (survival and reproduction) both in nature and the laboratory environment. "
"10","fitness","Environment-type specific bacteria The differential bacteria survival in each of the assayed environments raises the question on how such bacteria could affect Artemia fitness, once incorporated into the gut. "
"11","adaptation","The reported ecological and physiological capabilities of such bacteria can help to understand Artemia adaptation to natural and laboratory conditions. "
"12","adaptation","On one hand, Artemia as a model extremophile for studies of evolution and adaptation owing to the particular life cycle evolved to cope with harsh environmental conditions (Clegg and Trotman 2002; Gajardo et al. "
