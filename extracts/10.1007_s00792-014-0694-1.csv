"1","wild","The highest ecological diversity (Shannon’s index, H’) was found in brines, it decreased in the gut of wild and laboratory animals, and in laboratory water. "
"2","wild","Significant differences in H’ existed between brines and laboratory water, and between brines and gut of wild animals. "
"3","wild","These samples allowed comparisons between the following three types of environments: (a) field, water (brine) samples from natural locations (F_W); (b) laboratory, water samples (L_W) from laboratory-reared Artemia cultures; (c) gut, corresponds to the microbiota assessed in the digestive tube of wild (F_G) and laboratory-reared animals (L_G). "
"4","wild","Laboratory cultures were established from wild Artemia animals collected from each location, except for Laguna de los Cisnes (LAC) where only cysts were available at sampling, as explained below. "
"5","wild","Albeit partially, this means wild Artemia individuals tend to reflect the bacterial diversity of the environment they inhabit, be it nature or laboratory, a finding consistent with the fact that bacterial colonization of the gut is facilitated by the non-selective filter feeder nature of Artemia. "
"6","wild","It is interesting though to highlight that gut of wild-collected animals maintains a fraction of the natural diversity and, in some cases, bacteria not found in the water. "
"7","wild","For example, Sphingomonas (Alphaproteobacteria) was exclusively found in the gut of wild Artemia individuals, a genus reported to have the ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), b Fig. "
"8","wild","Chromohalobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) was mainly identified in the gut of wild Artemia collected in north, center and south Chile, but also in some cultured animals. "
"9","fitness","The recognition that microorganisms are ubiquitous to almost every environment, and able to establish different types of association, such as mutualism or parasitism (Fraune and Bosch 2010; Toft and Andersson 2010), led us to assume they should affect Artemia fitness (survival and reproduction) both in nature and the laboratory environment. "
"10","fitness","Environment-type specific bacteria The differential bacteria survival in each of the assayed environments raises the question on how such bacteria could affect Artemia fitness, once incorporated into the gut. "
"11","adaptat","The reported ecological and physiological capabilities of such bacteria can help to understand Artemia adaptation to natural and laboratory conditions. "

"33","environment","This study confirmed the large bacterial diversity existing in natural salty lakes, but at the same time showed how such natural diversity is greatly reduced in the gut environment of field and laboratory-reared animals and in the laboratory environment (water) as well, which turned out to be the least diverse in bacterial communities. "
"34","environment","Such bacteria stratification can be consequence of their differential survival to the selective pressures imposed by each environment, though further temporal monitoring along with more specific experimental studies would be required to confirm this. "
"35","environment","Particularly sensitive should be the female reproductive mode (ovoviviparity, oviparity) which is synchronized by unknown environmental cues. "
"36","environment","Such high diversity is confirmed in this study, but the heterogeneities observed among the comparisons made, i.e., natural sites (brines), gut, and laboratory environment (water of Artemia cultures) can be attributed, or correlated to salinity differences as it has been previously reported in evaporation ponds of salterns, where bacteria community composition and ecological interactions strongly varied among the salinity gradients (Benlloch et al.
