"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","Here, we analyzed the biodiversity at the level of small subunit rRNA gene sequence and the metabolic composition of 18 Mbp of consensus metagenome sequences and activity characteristics of bacterial intra-cellular extracts, in wild Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) fecal samples. "
"2","wild","These collective and unique bacterial, genetic and enzymatic activity signatures suggest that the wild lynx gut microbiota not only harbors gene sets underpinning sugar uptake from primary animal tissues (with the monotypic dietary profile of the wild lynx consisting of 80–100% wild rabbits) but also for the hydrolysis of prey-derived plant biomass. "
"3","wild","At present, this species is critically endangered due to the decline of its basic prey (the wild European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus), an increase in non-natural mortality, the fragmentation and loss of its habitat [7,8] and the effects of infectious diseases [9,10]. "
"4","wild","Fecal microbial communities of approximately 200 animals representing approximately 60 species have been analyzed to date, including human [13], buffalo [14,15], bovine rumen [16,17], pig [18,19], rat [20], turkey [21], swine [22], giant panda [23], wallaby [24], feline [25], canine [26,27], wild gorilla [28] and wild wolf [29] gut communities, to cite the most significant cases. "
"5","wild","Despite extensive information concerning the field ecology of the wild Iberian lynx [9,31–36], to date, no information is available regarding its gut microbial composition, structure and function. "
"6","wild","Contrary to previous thought, this study suggests an occurrence of high metabolic complexity in the gut of the wild Iberian lynx and possibly also in other carnivores. "
"7","wild","It should be noted that our investigation was restricted to the analysis of fecal samples from one-adult wild Iberian lynx. "
"8","wild","Methods Fresh fecal samples were collected and immediately processed from one-adult wild Iberian lynx from Sierra Morena (Santa Elena, Jaén, Spain; 38u2090N 3u3290O) captured as part of the routinely radio-monitoring program of the LIFE-Nature conservation project. "
"9","wild","Preparation of Protein Crude Extracts and Enzyme Assays Fresh fecal samples collected from two-adult wild Iberian lynxes, named Eva (for which DNA was isolated and analyzed here) and Granadilla, were used for activity test. "
"10","wild","In this context, as wild lynx is well known to have a monotypic diet that consists primarily of wild European rabbits, it could be used as a model to interrogate how a specific prey may shape predator intestinal microbiome. "
"11","wild","To uncover the genomic information of the dominant colonic bacteria in wild lynxes, fecal samples were collected from a healthy adult lynx captured near Santa Elena (Jaén, Spain) (Figure S1). "
"12","wild","Candidate division TM7, which is a recently recognized major lineage of the domain Bacteria with unknown cultivated representatives, was recovered from the distal gut of the wild lynx as singleton. "
"13","wild","Further studies will be required for the characterization of the archaeal community populating the distal gut of wild lynx. "
"14","wild","These findings were entirely unexpected considering the dietary profile of the wild lynx, which predominantly consisted of wild rabbits. "
"15","wild","Accordingly, using a complementary approach to the analysis of the gene repertoire, we aimed to improve our understanding of lynx-gut bacteria system by examining the sugar-degrading capacity of protein extracts from fecal samples from two wild lynxes, one corresponding to that for which DNA was isolated and analyzed here (named Eva) and a second one, named Granadilla, captured in the same area and under the same protocols. "
"16","wild","This sample was selected as a model ruminant-like animal because its availability; although, a better model might be to investigate the activity characteristics of the lynx basic prey (the wild European rabbit), technical limitations to capture wild animals (no hunting was allow during the year of lynx sample collection), limits this option. "
"17","wild","Intracellular enzyme (glycosyl hydrolase) activities associated to bacterial enzyme extracts isolated from two wild Iberian lynx fecal samples and rumen content from four rumen-fistulated and non-lactating Holstein cows. "
"18","wild","(A) Average potential hydrolysis rates (n = 2, 6 standard deviation in three technical replicates) in protein extracts from two wild lynxes (Eva and Granadilla) captured in the same area and under the same protocols. "
"19","wild","Conclusion In conclusion, the metagenomic approach described in this study represents a first attempt to preliminary characterize the tremendous bacterial diversity found in wild lynx feces. "
"20","wild","In addition to the bacterial diversity datasets, the collective genecentric metagenomic findings suggest that the wild lynx contains a distinct microbiome structure with respect to sugar processing and metabolism compared to any other gut microbiome reported to date. "
"21","wild","Whereas the first set of enzymes could be directly driven by diet (wild rabbits), the second set may appears to be driven by the prey characteristics and its diet (seeds and plants). "
"22","wild","In this context, wild lynx is well known to have a monotypic diet that consists primarily of wild European rabbits that in their turn utilize seeds and plants as their principal sources of energy. "

"28","adaptation","Additionally, as it has been suggested for microbes operating in the adult human gut, it is possible that the abnegation of motility is an adaptation mechanism for gut microbes to be able to persist in the intestinal environment because flagella are highly immunogenic and may lead to the bacteria being discarded [59]. "
"29","adaptation","Detection of Putative Enzyme Signatures for Sugar Metabolism Based on Activity Assays Microbial ability to thrive in ecological niches depends upon adaptation of their enzymatic machinery to physical-chemical environmental constraints in situ. "
