"
"2","wild","Noting the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology like nutrition and health, it is thus essential to understand how human–wildlife interactions and availability of anthropogenic food in habitats can affect an animal’s gut microbiome. "
"3","wild","Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we described the microbial composition of Japanese macaques experiencing different types of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability—captive, provisioned, crop‐raiding, and wild. "
"4","wild","In terms of beta diversity, captive populations harbored the most distinctive gut microbial composition, and had the greatest difference compared with wild populations. "
"5","wild","Whereas for provisioned and crop‐raiding groups, the macaques exhibited intermediate microbiota between wild and captive. "
"6","wild","Compared with feeding based experiments of humans and lab animals, wild animals exhibit even wider dietary variation. "
"7","wild","Food sources of wild NHPs vary temporally and spatially, in relation to the local climate, habitat type, plant phenology, and so on. "
"8","wild","Because the host–gut microbiome relationship has evolved in the natural environments, studies on wild, free‐ranging animals will allow more thorough understanding of the role of environmental factors in this relationship. "
"9","wild","From a nutritional aspect, monkey chow and the food enhancement from cropland and tourism tend to have lower fiber and higher digestible carbohydrates and energy value than wild foods (Clayton et al., 2018a; 2018b; Riley, Tolbert, & Farida, 2013). "
"10","wild","To further understand how the gut microbiome of wild animals could be affected by anthropogenic activities, we examined the gut microbiome of NHPs under several human‐disturbed habitats with varying availability of anthropogenic food. "
"11","wild","In the wild, Japanese macaques mainly feed on plant parts like leaves, flowers, fruits, buds, and bark but the proportion of each food item differs by seasons and regions (Tsuji, 2010). "
"12","wild","Specifically, we described and compared the gut microbiota of macaques with different accessibility to anthropogenic food under different human disturbance types, that is, wild, provisioned, crop‐raiding, and captive. "
"13","wild","As an outcome of their diverse, fiber‐rich diet, we hypothesized that the gut microbiome of wild macaques would be more diverse and enriched in microbes specialized for fiber digestion. "
"14","wild","Whereas for the anthropogenic food‐enhanced macaques, that is, captive, crop‐ raiding, and provisioned macaques, their gut microbiota would be less diverse and distinctive from that of the wild macaques based on the availability of anthropogenic food in habitats. "
"15","wild","Based on human disturbance types or diet the populations experienced, the monkeys were categorized as wild, provisioned, crop‐raiding, or captive (Tables 1 and S1). "
"16","wild","Samples from wild macaques were collected from free‐ranging groups in highland and lowland areas of 2 of 14 | LEE ET AL. "
"17","wild","For taxonomic identification, OTUs were assigned through the TABLE 1 Basic information of sample collection sites Disturbance types Site Diet Conspecific contact Living environment Close interaction with humans Captive PRI cage Simple diet; monkey chow ✕ Artificial High Captive PRI enclosure Simple diet; monkey chow ◯ Artificial High Provisioned Shodoshima Intensive provisioning (3–4/day) ◯ Partly artificial Medium Crop‐raiding Suzuka‐shi, Mie prefecture No record; natural and agricultural food source ◯ Generally wild Medium Provisioned Koshima Controlled provisioning (2/week) ◯ Wild Medium Wild Yakushima lowland Frugivory based ◯ Wild Rare Wild Yakushima highland Folivory based ◯ Wild Rare Abbreviation: PRI, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. ◯ and X means yes and no. "
"18","wild","Specifically, the levels are captive‐cage and enclosure (a), intensively provisioned‐Shodoshima (b), crop‐raiding‐Suzuka (c), less provisioned‐ Koshima (d), wild‐Yakushima lowland (e), wild‐Yakushima highland (f). "
"19","wild","Between different disturbance types, Shannon diversity index of captive macaques’ gut microbiome was significantly lower than that of the wild macaques (Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, captive vs. wild, p = .0275). "
"20","wild","NMDS, nonmetric multidimensional scaling; PCoA, principal coordinate analysis 6 of 14 | LEE ET AL. the intermediate position of captive and wild. "
"21","wild","Specifically, the levels are captive‐cage and enclosure, intensively provisioned‐Shodoshima, crop‐raiding‐Suzuka, less provisioned‐Koshima, wild‐Yakushima lowland, and wild‐Yakushima highland (Figure 3). "
"22","wild","For the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, macaques from wild populations had the highest value, followed by provisioned and crop‐raiding, with the lowest in captive populations (Kruskal‐Wallis rank sum test χ2 = 21.2245, df = 3, p < .0001; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"23","wild","For Prevotella, one of the dominant human gut microbial genera, significantly higher abundance was found in captive individuals, while crop‐raiding, provisioned, and wild individuals had similar abundance (Kruskal‐Wallis χ2 = 15.2951, df = 3, p < .001; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"24","wild","Whereas for Bacteroides, another dominant human gut microbial genus, wild harbored the highest abundance, followed by captive macaques, and the lowest abundance was found in crop‐raiding and provisioned macaques (Kruskal‐Wallis χ2 = 15.295, df = 3, p = .002; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"25","wild","However, previous studies on Japanese macaques focused on captive samples mostly (n = 2 from Hayakawa, Sawada et al., 2018; n = 97 from Ma et al., 2014) while limited samples were from wild, free‐ranging individuals (n = 2 from Hayakawa, Nathan, et al., 2018). "
"26","wild","For hosts from the Macaca genus, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochetes are the four most abundant bacterial phyla detected; in addition to Japanese macaques, these bacterial phyla also constitute a major part of the gut microbiota for captive Macaca mulatta (McKenna et al., 2008; Yasuda et al., 2015), captive Macaca fascicularis (Li et al., 2018), and wild Macaca thibetana (Sun et al., 2016). "
"27","wild","A gradual change of gut microbiome composition was detected from macaques heavily relied on anthropogenic food (captive) to those relied on natural foods (wild). "
"28","wild","However, gut microbial diversity did not necessarily decrease along with increasing availability of anthropogenic food in disturbed conditions; Shannon diversity index differed between captive and wild populations, but observed richness was similar among disturbance types. "
"29","wild","Within the three different types of human disturbance we examined, captivity poses the most contrasting diet from the wild environment. "
"30","wild","Recent research comparing captive and wild mammals also detected a general pattern of composition shift in captive animals (Clayton et al., 2016, 2018a; McKenzie et al., 2017). "
"31","wild","As reported in red‐shanked doucs, abundance of chloroplast is also positively related to the wildness of doucs’ lifestyle; chloroplast was barely observed in captive douc populations, while a considerable amount was detected in wild populations (Clayton et al., 2016). "
"32","wild","In contrast to that, the average NDF of major food leaves consumed by wild macaques were around 42% (Hanya, Kiyono, Takafumi, Tsujino, & Agetsuma, 2007). "
"33","wild","In the wild, such kinds of fiber‐rich food is an important part of the macaques’ daily diet (Hanya, 2004a, 2004b, 2010). "
"34","wild","Within provisioned samples, the diet of Koshima macaques resembles that of wild macaques since provisioning was restricted to twice a week (Go, 2010; Leca et al., 2008; Tsuji, Ito, Wada, & Watanabe, 2015). "
"35","wild","A negative relationship was found between the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes ratio and the availability of anthropogenic food for the macaques: the highest ratio was found in wild Japanese macaques, intermediate in crop‐raiding and provisioned, and lowest in captive macaques. "
"36","wild","In our data set, the increasing abundance of Firmicutes microbes in wild macaques’ gut was mainly accounted by microbes from families Lachnospiracea, Ruminococcaceae, and Peptococcaceae. "
"37","wild","Similarly, within wild rhesus macaque populations, macaques from high altitude regions exhibited an elevated ratio possibly as an adaptation to fiber‐rich diet and increased energy consumption in high altitude (Zhao et al., 2018). "
"38","wild","Considering Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are commonly present in most mammals, the ratio could be a suitable indicator for not only the macaques but also other wild animals. "
"39","wild","Comprehensive research of captive, semicaptive, and wild NHPs suggested that alpha diversity of NHPs’ gut microbiota was significantly reduced by the dietary shift associated with provisioning (Clayton et al., 2016, 2018a). "
"40","wild","Although we did detect lower Shannon diversity index in captive than wild populations, both observed richness and Shannon diversity did not show a decreasing trend along with the anthropogenic food availability in the habitat. "
"41","wild","In terms of indicator bacterial taxa, our wild populations had higher abundance of genus Bacteroides, which was found more enriched in other humanized NHPs (Clayton et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2018). "
"42","wild","In our study, the gut of captive macaques maintained gut microbial diversity similar to that of wild macaques, which may sustain macaques even in the suboptimal condition. "
"43","wild","For example, two groups for wild population were only gathered in Yakushima island, and captive samples were all from PRI only. "

"80","human","K E YWORD S gut microbiome, human disturbance, Macaca, primate 1 | INTRODUCTION The gut microbiome is the community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract and is actively involved in many aspects of host physiology such as energy harvest, nutrition (Amato et al., 2014, 2015a), behavior (Davari, Talaei, & Alaei, 2013), and immune system response (Round & Mazmanian, 2009). "
"81","human","Many studies based on feeding experiments have revealed that gut microbiota is related to the types and the macronutrient profile of food, as exemplified by the distinct human and non‐human primate (NHP) gut microbial communities in response to Western and non‐Western diets (Amato et al., 2015b; Wu et al., 2011). "
"82","human","In particular, humans who consume Western diets which is low in fiber, high in protein and fat exhibited increased Bacteroides, whereas those who consumed non‐ Western diets had increased abundance of Prevotella. "
"83","human","Compared with feeding based experiments of humans and lab animals, wild animals exhibit even wider dietary variation. "
"84","human","On the global scale, human disturbance like agriculture and tourism have been increasingly affecting ecology and behavior of NHPs (Fuentes, 2006; Fuentes & Hockings, 2010). "
"85","human","In particular, such human disturbance made anthropogenic food available to NHP via directly provisioning or crop‐raiding thus could easily influence foraging behavior and nutritional intake of the NHPs (Hill, 2017; Ilham, Nurdin, & Tsuji, 2017; McKinney, 2011; Sha & Hanya, 2013). "
"86","human","Likewise, the gut microbiome of captive NHPs is less diverse and shows signs of humanization, converging toward the modern human microbiome (Clayton et al., 2016). "
"87","human","However, captivity is not the only human activities influencing NHPs. "
"88","human","To further understand how the gut microbiome of wild animals could be affected by anthropogenic activities, we examined the gut microbiome of NHPs under several human‐disturbed habitats with varying availability of anthropogenic food. "
"89","human","In this sense, the Macaca genus serves as a suitable study subject due to their extensive distribution and close proximity to humans (Priston & McLennan, 2013). "
"90","human","Although researchers have noted the effect of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability on NHPs’ behavior, previous studies rarely examine varying degrees of human disturbance on single species, Japanese macaques hence are suitable study subjects since they are commensal with humans in many of their habitats. "
"91","human","Specifically, we described and compared the gut microbiota of macaques with different accessibility to anthropogenic food under different human disturbance types, that is, wild, provisioned, crop‐raiding, and captive. "
"92","human","Based on human disturbance types or diet the populations experienced, the monkeys were categorized as wild, provisioned, crop‐raiding, or captive (Tables 1 and S1). "

"
"101","human","Several indicators used in previous studies on gut microbiome, that is, Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, Chloroplast, Bacteroides, and Prevotella showed varying response to human disturbance and anthropogenic food enhancement. "
"102","human","For Prevotella, one of the dominant human gut microbial genera, significantly higher abundance was found in captive individuals, while crop‐raiding, provisioned, and wild individuals had similar abundance (Kruskal‐Wallis χ2 = 15.2951, df = 3, p < .001; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"103","human","Whereas for Bacteroides, another dominant human gut microbial genus, wild harbored the highest abundance, followed by captive macaques, and the lowest abundance was found in crop‐raiding and provisioned macaques (Kruskal‐Wallis χ2 = 15.295, df = 3, p = .002; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"104","human","Overall, the gut microbiome profile of Japanese macaques is similar to other macaques but different from great apes and humans. "
"105","human","In this sense, Japanese macaques and other primate species including humans are similar, since Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes make up a great proportion of the gut microbiome. "
"106","human","Similarly in humans, these four bacterial phyla are the majority of gut microbiota but the relative abundance varies with dietary habits (Arumugam et al., 2011; Bäckhed, Ley, Sonnenburg, Peterson, & Gordon, 2005; De Filippo et al., 2010). "
"107","human","Human, non‐ human apes, and macaque gut microbiome is distinctive in the presence of phyla Spirochetes, which tends to be rare in human and non‐human ape guts. "
"108","human","Also, genus Bacteroides is considered a major component of the human gut microbiota, but only minor in the macaque gut. "
"109","human","Instead, Prevotella, another dominant bacterial genus for the human gut, is the most dominant genus for macaques. "
"110","human","This difference was also noted by McKenna et al. (2008), who compared the gut microbiome profile of rhesus macaques with that of humans. "
"111","human","Within the three different types of human disturbance we examined, captivity poses the most contrasting diet from the wild environment. "
"112","human","In addition to dietary change, other environmental factor relating to human disturbance that may be related to altered composition in gut microbiome, such as hygiene, home range, social contact, and geography (Clayton et al., 2016, 2018a). "
"113","human","For example, we found chloroplast abundance, an indirect indicator of plant intake, more enriched in macaques less disturbed by human activities. "
"114","human","Some studies suggested that crop‐raiding events were highly related with food availability in the forest; in food scarce seasons like summer and winter, macaques rely more on human settlements and crops (Ueda, Kiyono, Nagano, Mochizuki, & Murakami, 2018; Yamada & Muroyama, 2010). "
"115","human","F IGURE 6 Relative abundance of the dominant bacterial genera in human, Prevotella and Bacteroides LEE ET AL. | 9 of 14 Another exemplary bacterial indicator revealing the relationship between diet and the gut microbiome may be the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes ratio. "
"116","human","In terms of indicator bacterial taxa, our wild populations had higher abundance of genus Bacteroides, which was found more enriched in other humanized NHPs (Clayton et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2018). "
"117","human","Our study subject, the Japanese macaques, may be another example suited to human‐disturbed habitats by having taxonomically diverse but functionally redundant microbes. "
"118","human","Despite the presence of confounding factors, we believe that the dietary change caused by human disturbance is one of the major elements leading to the difference in gut microbiota presented in this study. "
"119","human","However, another problem in this study is that the sampling sites and populations experiencing different human disturbance level are confounded. "
"120","human","To some degree, the gut microbiome can provide a general picture of human disturbance as our data did reveal a gradual change of gut microbial community along anthropogenic food availability in macaques’ habitat. "
