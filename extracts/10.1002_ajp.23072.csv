"
"2","wild","Noting the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology like nutrition and health, it is thus essential to understand how human–wildlife interactions and availability of anthropogenic food in habitats can affect an animal’s gut microbiome. "
"3","wild","Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we described the microbial composition of Japanese macaques experiencing different types of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability—captive, provisioned, crop‐raiding, and wild. "
"4","wild","In terms of beta diversity, captive populations harbored the most distinctive gut microbial composition, and had the greatest difference compared with wild populations. "
"5","wild","Whereas for provisioned and crop‐raiding groups, the macaques exhibited intermediate microbiota between wild and captive. "
"6","wild","Compared with feeding based experiments of humans and lab animals, wild animals exhibit even wider dietary variation. "
"7","wild","Food sources of wild NHPs vary temporally and spatially, in relation to the local climate, habitat type, plant phenology, and so on. "
"8","wild","Because the host–gut microbiome relationship has evolved in the natural environments, studies on wild, free‐ranging animals will allow more thorough understanding of the role of environmental factors in this relationship. "
"9","wild","From a nutritional aspect, monkey chow and the food enhancement from cropland and tourism tend to have lower fiber and higher digestible carbohydrates and energy value than wild foods (Clayton et al., 2018a; 2018b; Riley, Tolbert, & Farida, 2013). "
"10","wild","To further understand how the gut microbiome of wild animals could be affected by anthropogenic activities, we examined the gut microbiome of NHPs under several human‐disturbed habitats with varying availability of anthropogenic food. "
"11","wild","In the wild, Japanese macaques mainly feed on plant parts like leaves, flowers, fruits, buds, and bark but the proportion of each food item differs by seasons and regions (Tsuji, 2010). "
"12","wild","Specifically, we described and compared the gut microbiota of macaques with different accessibility to anthropogenic food under different human disturbance types, that is, wild, provisioned, crop‐raiding, and captive. "
"13","wild","As an outcome of their diverse, fiber‐rich diet, we hypothesized that the gut microbiome of wild macaques would be more diverse and enriched in microbes specialized for fiber digestion. "
"14","wild","Whereas for the anthropogenic food‐enhanced macaques, that is, captive, crop‐ raiding, and provisioned macaques, their gut microbiota would be less diverse and distinctive from that of the wild macaques based on the availability of anthropogenic food in habitats. "
"15","wild","Based on human disturbance types or diet the populations experienced, the monkeys were categorized as wild, provisioned, crop‐raiding, or captive (Tables 1 and S1). "
"16","wild","Samples from wild macaques were collected from free‐ranging groups in highland and lowland areas of 2 of 14 | LEE ET AL. "
"17","wild","For taxonomic identification, OTUs were assigned through the TABLE 1 Basic information of sample collection sites Disturbance types Site Diet Conspecific contact Living environment Close interaction with humans Captive PRI cage Simple diet; monkey chow ✕ Artificial High Captive PRI enclosure Simple diet; monkey chow ◯ Artificial High Provisioned Shodoshima Intensive provisioning (3–4/day) ◯ Partly artificial Medium Crop‐raiding Suzuka‐shi, Mie prefecture No record; natural and agricultural food source ◯ Generally wild Medium Provisioned Koshima Controlled provisioning (2/week) ◯ Wild Medium Wild Yakushima lowland Frugivory based ◯ Wild Rare Wild Yakushima highland Folivory based ◯ Wild Rare Abbreviation: PRI, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. ◯ and X means yes and no. "
"18","wild","Specifically, the levels are captive‐cage and enclosure (a), intensively provisioned‐Shodoshima (b), crop‐raiding‐Suzuka (c), less provisioned‐ Koshima (d), wild‐Yakushima lowland (e), wild‐Yakushima highland (f). "
"19","wild","Between different disturbance types, Shannon diversity index of captive macaques’ gut microbiome was significantly lower than that of the wild macaques (Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, captive vs. wild, p = .0275). "
"20","wild","NMDS, nonmetric multidimensional scaling; PCoA, principal coordinate analysis 6 of 14 | LEE ET AL. the intermediate position of captive and wild. "
"21","wild","Specifically, the levels are captive‐cage and enclosure, intensively provisioned‐Shodoshima, crop‐raiding‐Suzuka, less provisioned‐Koshima, wild‐Yakushima lowland, and wild‐Yakushima highland (Figure 3). "
"22","wild","For the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, macaques from wild populations had the highest value, followed by provisioned and crop‐raiding, with the lowest in captive populations (Kruskal‐Wallis rank sum test χ2 = 21.2245, df = 3, p < .0001; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"23","wild","For Prevotella, one of the dominant human gut microbial genera, significantly higher abundance was found in captive individuals, while crop‐raiding, provisioned, and wild individuals had similar abundance (Kruskal‐Wallis χ2 = 15.2951, df = 3, p < .001; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"24","wild","Whereas for Bacteroides, another dominant human gut microbial genus, wild harbored the highest abundance, followed by captive macaques, and the lowest abundance was found in crop‐raiding and provisioned macaques (Kruskal‐Wallis χ2 = 15.295, df = 3, p = .002; Dunn’s rank sum test corrected by Bonferroni, Captive vs. "
"25","wild","However, previous studies on Japanese macaques focused on captive samples mostly (n = 2 from Hayakawa, Sawada et al., 2018; n = 97 from Ma et al., 2014) while limited samples were from wild, free‐ranging individuals (n = 2 from Hayakawa, Nathan, et al., 2018). "
"26","wild","For hosts from the Macaca genus, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochetes are the four most abundant bacterial phyla detected; in addition to Japanese macaques, these bacterial phyla also constitute a major part of the gut microbiota for captive Macaca mulatta (McKenna et al., 2008; Yasuda et al., 2015), captive Macaca fascicularis (Li et al., 2018), and wild Macaca thibetana (Sun et al., 2016). "
"27","wild","A gradual change of gut microbiome composition was detected from macaques heavily relied on anthropogenic food (captive) to those relied on natural foods (wild). "
"28","wild","However, gut microbial diversity did not necessarily decrease along with increasing availability of anthropogenic food in disturbed conditions; Shannon diversity index differed between captive and wild populations, but observed richness was similar among disturbance types. "
"29","wild","Within the three different types of human disturbance we examined, captivity poses the most contrasting diet from the wild environment. "
"30","wild","Recent research comparing captive and wild mammals also detected a general pattern of composition shift in captive animals (Clayton et al., 2016, 2018a; McKenzie et al., 2017). "
"31","wild","As reported in red‐shanked doucs, abundance of chloroplast is also positively related to the wildness of doucs’ lifestyle; chloroplast was barely observed in captive douc populations, while a considerable amount was detected in wild populations (Clayton et al., 2016). "
"32","wild","In contrast to that, the average NDF of major food leaves consumed by wild macaques were around 42% (Hanya, Kiyono, Takafumi, Tsujino, & Agetsuma, 2007). "
"33","wild","In the wild, such kinds of fiber‐rich food is an important part of the macaques’ daily diet (Hanya, 2004a, 2004b, 2010). "
"34","wild","Within provisioned samples, the diet of Koshima macaques resembles that of wild macaques since provisioning was restricted to twice a week (Go, 2010; Leca et al., 2008; Tsuji, Ito, Wada, & Watanabe, 2015). "
"35","wild","A negative relationship was found between the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes ratio and the availability of anthropogenic food for the macaques: the highest ratio was found in wild Japanese macaques, intermediate in crop‐raiding and provisioned, and lowest in captive macaques. "
"36","wild","In our data set, the increasing abundance of Firmicutes microbes in wild macaques’ gut was mainly accounted by microbes from families Lachnospiracea, Ruminococcaceae, and Peptococcaceae. "
"37","wild","Similarly, within wild rhesus macaque populations, macaques from high altitude regions exhibited an elevated ratio possibly as an adaptation to fiber‐rich diet and increased energy consumption in high altitude (Zhao et al., 2018). "
"38","wild","Considering Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are commonly present in most mammals, the ratio could be a suitable indicator for not only the macaques but also other wild animals. "
"39","wild","Comprehensive research of captive, semicaptive, and wild NHPs suggested that alpha diversity of NHPs’ gut microbiota was significantly reduced by the dietary shift associated with provisioning (Clayton et al., 2016, 2018a). "
"40","wild","Although we did detect lower Shannon diversity index in captive than wild populations, both observed richness and Shannon diversity did not show a decreasing trend along with the anthropogenic food availability in the habitat. "
"41","wild","In terms of indicator bacterial taxa, our wild populations had higher abundance of genus Bacteroides, which was found more enriched in other humanized NHPs (Clayton et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2018). "
"42","wild","In our study, the gut of captive macaques maintained gut microbial diversity similar to that of wild macaques, which may sustain macaques even in the suboptimal condition. "
"43","wild","For example, two groups for wild population were only gathered in Yakushima island, and captive samples were all from PRI only. "
"44","wild","If effect of sites were greater, then gut microbiota of both wild groups from Yakushima island should be more similar. "

"53","adaptation","Similarly, within wild rhesus macaque populations, macaques from high altitude regions exhibited an elevated ratio possibly as an adaptation to fiber‐rich diet and increased energy consumption in high altitude (Zhao et al., 2018). "
