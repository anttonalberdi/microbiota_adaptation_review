"1","wild","When compared to wild-type animals, mice lacking SIRT1 catalytic activity rapidly accumulated excessive hepatic lipid while fed the HFD, an effect evident within 2 wk of HFD feeding. "
"2","wild","Despite their elevated rates of respiration, we report that these animals developed more severe characteristics of metabolic syndrome than did their wild-type littermates, indicating that the catalytic activity of SIRT1 plays an important role in the acclimation of mice to diets rich in calories, perhaps by influencing the composition of the gut microbiome. "
"3","wild","Both Sirt1/ and Sirt1Y/Y mice are smaller than Sirt1/ animals, but consume as many calories and as much oxygen as their larger wild-type littermates (15, 17). "
"4","adaptat","The more moderate response of mice expressing normal SIRT1 suggests that this enzyme plays a role in facilitating the organismsâ€™ adaptation to calorie overload. "
"5","adaptat","The elevated levels of SIRT1 protein found in livers of both the Sirt1/ and Sirt1Y/Y mice after prolonged (12 wk) HFD feeding are consistent with the idea that SIRT1 plays a role in adaptation to the HFD challenge. "
"6","adaptat","Our study and many others performed in animals carrying genetically altered expression of SIRT1 suggest that the main function of SIRT1 is to mediate adaptation of chronic stresses. "
"7","adaptat","(2013) SIRT1 Is a highly networked protein that mediates the adaptation to chronic physiological stress. "
"8","mutant","This mutant allele (Sirt1tm2.1Mcby, abbreviated here as Sirt1Y) encodes a protein, SIRT1(H335Y), that has undetectable catalytic activity (17). "
"9","model","E) Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was higher in Sirt1Y/Y than Sirt1/ mice after 12 wk of HFD. "
"10","model","The homeostasis model-assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) for Sirt1Y/Y mice (Fig. "
"11","knockout","Previous reports have indicated that liver-specific knockout of the SIRT1 protein results in hepatic lipid accumulation (12, 29) and, conversely, that elevated SIRT1 is protective (11, 30). "
"12","disease","It is an increasingly important health concern in Western society because it predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. "
"13","disease","Gut microbiota Changes in the gut microbiota are related to obesity (27) and the development of fatty liver disease (28). "
"14","disease","(2013) Intestinal microbiota determines development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice. "
"15","disease","(2012) Seven sirtuins for seven deadly diseases of aging. "
"16","environment","(2004) The gut microbiota as an environmental factor that regulates fat storage. "
"17","human","In humans, etiology is complex, but in experimental rodents, the condition can be readily induced by feeding animals diets with high calorie content, such as a high-fat diet (HFD). "
"18","human","(2011) Association between composition of the human gastrointestinal microbiome and development of fatty liver with choline deficiency. "
"19","human","(2012) Interactomic and pharmacological insights on human sirt-1. "
