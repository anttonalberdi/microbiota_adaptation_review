"1","wild","When compared to wild-type animals, mice lacking SIRT1 catalytic activity rapidly accumulated excessive hepatic lipid while fed the HFD, an effect evident within 2 wk of HFD feeding. "
"2","wild","Despite their elevated rates of respiration, we report that these animals developed more severe characteristics of metabolic syndrome than did their wild-type littermates, indicating that the catalytic activity of SIRT1 plays an important role in the acclimation of mice to diets rich in calories, perhaps by influencing the composition of the gut microbiome. "
"3","wild","Both Sirt1/ and Sirt1Y/Y mice are smaller than Sirt1/ animals, but consume as many calories and as much oxygen as their larger wild-type littermates (15, 17). "
"4","adaptation","The more moderate response of mice expressing normal SIRT1 suggests that this enzyme plays a role in facilitating the organismsâ€™ adaptation to calorie overload. "
"5","adaptation","The elevated levels of SIRT1 protein found in livers of both the Sirt1/ and Sirt1Y/Y mice after prolonged (12 wk) HFD feeding are consistent with the idea that SIRT1 plays a role in adaptation to the HFD challenge. "
"6","adaptation","Our study and many others performed in animals carrying genetically altered expression of SIRT1 suggest that the main function of SIRT1 is to mediate adaptation of chronic stresses. "
"7","adaptation","(2013) SIRT1 Is a highly networked protein that mediates the adaptation to chronic physiological stress. "
