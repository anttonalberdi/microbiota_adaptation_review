"1","wild","Therefore, we characterized the bacterial population in the crop of six adult hoatzins captured from the wild. "
"2","wild","Six adult hoatzins from different social groups were captured from the wild at Piñero Ranch in the savannas of Cojedes state in Venezuela (68°4W, 8°82N) with permits from the Venezuelan Ministry of Environment (#11-193) and from the UPR-IACUC (#601-2007). "
"3","wild","RESULTS We used culture-independent, molecular methods to determine the composition of microbial communities harvested from the crops of six wild adult hoatzins. "
"4","wild","Comparison of the cecal microbiota of domestic and wild turkeys. "
"5","adaptat","Molecular adaptation of a leaf-eating bird: stomach lysozyme of the hoatzin. "
"6","model","A small-bodied flying foregut fermenter is a paradox, and this bird provides an interesting model to examine how diet selection and the gut microbiota contribute to maximizing digestive efficiency. "
"7","environment","UniFrac analyses were based on an ARB neighbor-joining tree of 16S rRNA gene sequences, their frequencies, and their assigned environments (individual crops). "
"8","environment","ARB: a software environment for sequence data. "
"9","human","Despite the partial coverage obtained in this survey, the 580 OTUs (or even the 402 OTUs that could be classified using a less stringent threshold cutoff, 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity) represent greater richness than that described in the more deeply sampled human colon (10). "
