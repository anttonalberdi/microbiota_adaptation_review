"1","wild","We colonized germfree wildtype and colitis-prone interleukin-10-deficient mice with defined bacterial consortia containing the E. faecalis strains and measured inflammation and bacterial abundance in the colon. "
"2","wild","Since others have previously found that mRNA levels of OG1RF_12398-12405 in colonic E. faecalis from E. faecalis OG1RF monocolonized wild-type mice are elevated compared with laboratory-cultured E. faecalis OG1RF, we hypothesized that these genes are important for robust growth of E. faecalis in the mouse colon (8). "
"3","wild","To test this hypothesis, we colonized germfree wild-type mice (SvEv/129 background) for 5 weeks with a mixture of eight bacterial strains (Table 1) that represent each of the major bacterial phyla in the mammalian intestine, including E. faecalis OG1RF or OG1RFΔ12399-12402. "
"4","wild","Although OG1RF_12399-12402 do not affect colonization levels in healthy wild-type mice, we asked whether these genes affect colonization levels and colitis severity in Il10/ mice. "
"5","wild","To answer these questions, we colonized germfree wild-type and Il10/ mice (SvEv/129 background) with the same eight bacterial strains as the ones described above (Table 1) for 5, 8, or 10 weeks and measured histological inflammation in colon segments and spontaneous secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12/23p40 by colon explant cultures in these mice. "
"6","wild","As expected, histological inflammation and IL-12/23p40 secretion in the colons of Il10/ versus wild-type mice are increased at each time point (Fig. "
"7","wild","We directly tested the effects of OG1RF_12399-12402 on colitis by colonizing wild-type and Il10/ mice for 5 or 10 weeks with the mixture of eight bacterial strains (Table 1) containing either parental E. faecalis OG1RF or OG1RFΔ12399-12402 and then measured colitis severity using histological scoring and spontaneous secretion of IL-12/23p40 by colonic explant cultures as described above. "
"8","wild","As expected, Il10/ mice have worse histological inflammation and higher levels of IL-12/23p40 secretion at 5 and 10 weeks than do wild-type mice (Fig. "
"9","wild","The presence of OG1RF_12399-12402 does not affect histological inflammation or IL-12/23p40 secretion in wild-type mice or in Il10/ mice at 10 weeks. "
"10","wild","Similar to observations in wild-type mice, we detected no significant differences in E. faecalis numbers in the cecal or midcolon contents of Il10/ mice colonized for 5 weeks with bacterial mixtures containing E. faecalis OG1RF versus OG1RFΔ12399-12402 (Fig. "
"11","wild","Since mucosa-associated FIG 3 The absence of OG1RF_12399-12402 does not alter the abundance of E. faecalis OG1RF bacteria in gnotobiotic wild-type mice. "
"12","wild","Shown are E. faecalis 16S rRNA gene copy numbers relative to the total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy number in cecal contents of wild-type mice colonized with a mixture of the eight bacterial strains listed in Table 1 for 5 weeks. "
"13","wild","(A) Representative photomicrographs of hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained cecal tissue from wild-type (WT) and Il10/ mice colonized with the eight bacterial strains listed in Table 1 for the indicated times (bar  100 m). "
"14","wild","(A) Representative photomicrographs of hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained cecal tissue from wild-type and Il10/ mice colonized with the bacterial strains listed in Table 1 but including either E. faecalis OG1RF (OG1RF) or E. faecalis OG1RFΔ12399-12402 (OG1RFΔ). "
"15","wild","(E) CFU per mesenteric lymph node cell in wild-type mice monocolonized for 2 weeks with either E. faecalis OG1RF or E. faecalis OG1RFΔ1239912402. "
"16","wild","Germfree wild-type and Il10/ mice (both on the 129S6/SvEv background), originally derived under sterile conditions by hysterectomy at the Gnotobiotic Laboratory (University of Wisconsin— Madison), were purchased from the UNC National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center. "
"17","mutant","To experimentally test whether these predictions are correct, we first created an in-frame isogenic deletion mutant of OG1RF_12399-12402 (OG1RFΔ12399-12402), genes that are predicted to encode the core PTS components EIIA, EIIB, EIID, and EIIC of this operon. "
"18","mutant","We then grew the parental and OG1RFΔ12399-12402 mutant strains in minimal media containing single sugars as carbon sources. "
"19","mutant","To confirm that the growth defect was not due to a spurious mutation elsewhere on the chromosome of OG1RFΔ12399-12402, we reintroduced the native OG1RF_12399-12402 genes back into the chromosome of the deletion mutant (OG1RFΔ12399-12402Comp) and found that the growth phenotype in gluconate-containing medium reverts to that of the parental strain (Fig. "
"20","mutant","The mutant was introduced onto the chromosome of OG1RFΔ12399-12402 by homologous recombination as described above and sequence confirmed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of the operon. "
"21","mutant","We also thank Gary Port for technical advice during the construction of the E. faecalis deletion mutant. "
