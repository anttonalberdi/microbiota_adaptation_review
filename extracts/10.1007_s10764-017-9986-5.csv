"1","wild","We studied 34 wild-caught slow lorises (15 Nycticebus coucang, 15 N. javanicus, and 4 N. menegensis) in an Indonesian rescue center and four captive-born slow lorises (2 N. bengalensis and 2 N. pygmaeus) in a UK institution. "
"2","wild","We fed the Indonesian subjects two different diets: a captive-type diet comprising fruits, vegetables, and insects and a wild-type diet formulated to be similar in nutrients to that consumed by slow lorises in the wild, consisting of gum, insects, vegetables, and nectar. "
"3","wild","We formulated this diet to mimic the wild diet, with notably higher fiber fractions and lower soluble sugars than the previous diet. "
"4","wild","We found that TTs were not affected by diet treatment but MRTs were significantly longer for all species fed the wild-type diet. "
"5","wild","MRT values are difficult to measure in wild animals, so researchers use MRT in captive animals to infer information about the wild ecological niche, revealing information about energetic needs and digestive ecology (Blaine and Lambert 2012; Lambert 1999, 2002). "
"6","wild","Recent research shows that exudates play a vital role across slow loris species in the wild (Nycticebus pygmaeus, N. coucang, N. bengalensis – all Vulnerable, and N. javanicus – Critically Endangered), with these taxa spending 43–87% of feeding time on exudates (Cabana et al. "
"7","wild","We aimed to compare the TT and MRT of five slow loris species (Nycticebus coucang, N. javanicus, N. menagensis, N. bengalensis, N. pygmaeus) fed a traditional captive diet and a diet formulated to resemble wild diets to further understand the digestive strategy of exudativorous primates. "
"8","wild","All animals at CWRC were wild born and had been at the center for 14–20 mo. "
"9","wild","Both N. pygmaeus were captive born, and both N. bengalensis were wild born. "
"10","wild","We based the wild-type diet on a year-long ecological study of Javan slow lorises (Cabana et al. "
"11","wild","The wild-type diet consisted of 20 g of various insects (including mealworms, crickets, wild caught katydids, sago worm larvae, and pupae mix), carrots (10 g), green beans (10 g), young bamboo leaves (Gigantochloa cf. ater: 5 g), and gum directly from Acacia decurrens trees (20 g). "
"12","wild","We changed the captive type diet to the wild-type diet progressively over 7 days. "
"13","wild","We then tried 5.0 g of glitter inside a banana in the captive diet, and in 10 g of gum for the wild-type diet at CWRC and at SWT. "
"14","wild","We used a gamma distribution for the response variables (TT and MRT), individual as a random factor and diet (captive and wild), and 904 Cabana F. et al. the three species (Nycticebus coucang, N. javanicus, and N. menagensis) as fixed factors. "
"15","wild","We also performed a Wilcoxon signed rank test, comparing the nutrient concentrations ingested each CWRC slow loris when fed the captive diet and the wild diet. "
"16","wild","Results Transit and Mean Retention Times The mean TT for CWRC Nycticebus spp. on the captive type diet ranged 24.2–25.6 h, and on the wild type diet ranged 24.4–25.9 h (Table I). "
"17","wild","905 CWRC on the captive type diet ranged 29.7–33.4 h and on the wild-type diet ranged 34.1–88.5 h. "
"18","wild","The MRTs of both N. javanicus (B = 4.600, df = 2, P = 0.0001) and N. coucang (B = 4.000, df = 2, P = 0.0001) were ca. 4 h longer than N. menagensis fed the wild-type diet. "
"19","wild","Nutrients Ingested by Slow Lorises The mean nutrient values ingested by slow lorises fed the captive-type diet at CWRC were different from those in the wild type diet (Table II). "
"20","wild","Our Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that all nutrients ingested except iron were significantly different between the captive and wild diets (Table III). "
"21","wild","The wild-type diet increased MRT by up to 42% but did not change TT values. "
"22","wild","The two different diets led to significantly different nutrient concentrations being ingested for every nutrient except iron, which also reflects how different captive diets can be to wild slow loris diets. "
"23","wild","Their long MRTs (ranging 29.70–33.40 h) increased by 4–29% when fed the wild-type diet. "
"24","wild","The SWT diet contained gum arabic, insects (crickets and mealworms), eggs, vegetables, and fruit, effectively making it a hybrid of the captive and wild-type diets, but the dietary fiber values were closer to the wild-type diet. "
"25","wild","Slow lorises also appear to possess adaptations to highfiber diets, reflected in the large increase in MRT when we fed them wild-type diets. "

"
"27","wild","Overall, captive diets are lacking or low in gum (and coincidentally in fiber compared to the wild) and are high in soluble carbohydrates (Cabana and Nekaris 2015). "

"32","adaptat","This anatomy most likely reflects an adaptation for efficient use of high-fiber diets and active microbial populations. "

"34","model","We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to test for main effects of species and diet composition on the TT and MRT. "
"35","model","The TT was not affected by any variables we tested (overall model: χ2 = 77.549, df = 271, P = 0.0001; diet χ2 = 1.647, df = 1, P = 0.199; species χ2 = 54.528, df = 2, P = 0.608) but for MRT (overall model: (χ2 = 211.394, df = 271, P = 0.0001) both diet (χ2 = 710.276, df = 1, P = 0.0001) and species (χ2 = 17.531, df = 2, P = 0.0001) had a significant effect. "
"36","disease","This misconception has led zoos and rescue centres to feed slow lorises diets comprising largely fruits, a practice that has been implicated in reduced reproduction and a high incidence of diseases, most notably dental and renal diseases (Cabana 2014; Cabana and Nekaris 2015; Debyser 1995; Fuller et al.
