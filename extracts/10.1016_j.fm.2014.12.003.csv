"
"2","wild","It has been reported that raw cows' milk from Trentino alpine region has a high biodiversity and some wild LAB strains showed interesting technological properties (Franciosi et al., 2009). "
"3","wild","All these results confirmed the Malga environment as a good reservoir of wild lactobacilli with technological and bioactive potentials that could beexploited for the improvement of cheese quality. "
"4","wild","Biodiversity and technological potential of wild lactic acid bacteria from raw cows' milk. "
"5","model","Conclusions This is a preliminary study confirming that TMM-cheese has a high microbial biodiversity and it may represent a model of raw cow milk cheese, spontaneously fermented, according to the dairy mountain tradition in the Italian Alpine area. "
"6","disease","GABA, g-hydroxybutyric acid, and neurological disease. "
"7","environment","Lb. paracasei isolates resulted to be well adapted to Malga environment and to show the best AP activity and acetoin production. "
"8","environment","It has been reported that raw milk cheeses have more intense flavours than pasteurised milk cheeses (Albenzio et al., 2001; Beuvier et al., 1997; Demarigny et al., 1997) and their organoleptic characteristics are widely correlated with the nutrition of the milk producing cows, the quality and the environmental contamination of the collected milk, the technological procedures and the presence of appropriate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Beresford et al., 2001; Corroler et al., 1998; Grappin and Beuvier, 1998). "
"9","environment","During ripening, the cheese environment becomes unfavourable for growth of most microorganisms; there is low water activity, high salt content, low pH and low temperature (Kask et al., 2003). "
"10","environment","Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy environment were found able to produce bioactive compounds, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Settanni and Moschetti, 2010). "
"11","environment","The psychrotrophic attitude and the salt tolerance may be determined by the cheeseripening environment: in fact, TMM-cheese wheels are brine salted for two days and ripened for sevenmonths in a store-roomwith the temperature range of 15e18 C. "
"12","environment","The role of the dairy environment (ripening store temperature) and the cheese-making procedures (cheese cooking temperature) on the selection of dairy adapted LAB were previously reported by Monfredini et al. "
"13","environment","Most of the biotypes isolated from TMM-cheese were subjected to a selection by the dairy environment during the dairy production: all species were resistant to high salt concentration and had psychrotrophic attitude; most of them showed AP activity, acetoin production and did not generate BA. "
"14","environment","All these results confirmed the Malga environment as a good reservoir of wild lactobacilli with technological and bioactive potentials that could beexploited for the improvement of cheese quality. "
"15","human","Dairy LAB are generally assayed also for some undesirable properties, as lipolytic activity which could induce a rancid flavour to cheese during the ripening (Herrero et al., 1996) and biogenic amines (BA) production because they could induce toxicological (palpitations, headaches and flushing) and systemic pathophysiological effects in humans such as allergies and inflammations (Gonzaga et al., 2009; Spano et al., 2010). "
"16","human","Production of free conjugated linoleic acid by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei of human intestinal origin. "
"17","human","Terpenes and fatty acid profiles of milk fat and ‘‘Bitto” cheese as affected by transhumance of cows on different mountain pastures. "
