"6","wild","Pronounced population structure is shaped by geographic origin and wild versus captive provenance We characterised general patterns of population differentiation and applied complementary approaches to identify key factors shaping BSF global population genetic structure. "
"7","wild","Characteristics of the populations allocated to the 16 distinct clusters (Table 2) revealed that genetic clustering largely reflects geography and provenance (i.e. wild vs. captive origin) within but also across regions, including specific breeding-mediated signatures of some farmed BSF strains (see also Tables S3-S6, Additional file 2). "
"8","wild","On a global scale, AR of wild populations was significantly higher than for captive samples (p < 0.001; Table S8, Additional file 2). "
"9","wild","Separate AMOVAs of wild and captive populations across geographic regions indicated that captive populations are more structured across subcontinents than wild populations. "
"10","wild","Conversely, wild populations exhibited more pronounced structure between populations within subcontinents, with less variation between individuals within populations (Table 3a). "
"11","wild","A breakdown of these associations for both (pooled) provenances (r = 0.214) clearly indicates genetic mismatches of wild and captive populations in some regions, as also reflected by the FCA (Fig. 2) and genetic distance networks (Fig. "
"12","wild","We then evaluated whether captive provenance aligns or contrasts with the geographic population structure of wild populations within subcontinents. "
"13","wild","On all subcontinents, apart from the Americas, IBD across wild and captive populations was lower compared to only wild populations (Table S9, Additional file 2): while IBD differed only slightly in Africa (r = 0.411 vs. r = 0.497), the difference was much stronger across Australasia (r = 0.236 vs. r = 0.413), and substantial in Europe (r = 0.019 vs. r = 0.389). "
"14","wild","BMC Biology (2021) 19:94 Page 4 of 22 We neither found structure (Table 3b) nor significant differences in diversity (Table S8, Additional file 2) between captive and wild populations in South and Central America and Australia, respectively. "
"15","wild","This suggests that in these geographic regions captive populations exclusively derive from local wild gene pools and that there is frequent gene flow between provenances and hence limited genetic signatures of fly farming practices on local captive populations (Fig. "

"30","wild","Only wild populations from central-east Africa and two wild populations from west Africa grouped close to captive African populations and North American wild populations (clusters 2 and 16, respectively, Table 2, Figs. 1 and 3). "
"31","wild","Cluster 13 exclusively comprised wild populations from west Africa (Table 2, Fig. "
"32","wild","All wild populations from southeast Africa formed cluster 11 (Table 2, Figs. 1 and 4), which appeared the least differentiated from Australasian wild populations of all African wild populations. "
"33","wild","Europe European wild populations exhibited significantly reduced AR compared to wild populations from the Americas (p < 0.001; Table S8, Additional file 2). "
"34","wild","Cluster analysis assigned all western European wild populations to cluster 10 (Table 2, Fig. 4), related to south-east African and eastern Australian populations (Fig. "
"35","wild","This pattern was also supported by FCA (Fig. 2), while DCH grouped all western European wild populations with west African populations (Fig. "
"36","wild","Consistent clustering with wild populations from the Americas was found in the Mediterranean: the southern European wild population largely grouped with cluster 15, while individuals of the south-eastern European wild population were assigned to cluster 14 or cluster 16 (Table 2, Figs. 1, 3 and 4). "
"37","wild","Populations of clusters 1–4 did not significantly differ from global wild populations, and both groups showed significantly lower FIS than captive populations that were locally derived from wild populations of other clusters (Table S14, Additional file 2). "
"38","wild","Ratios of the variance components for LD between (DST) and within (DIS) populations [47] across all pairs of loci were significantly lower for populations assigned to clusters 1–4 than for wild populations worldwide, but not compared to wildderived captive populations from other clusters (Table S15, Additional file 2). "
"39","wild","Specifically considering the seven pairs of loci in high LD, clusters 1–4 demonstrated significantly lower DST/DIS ratios than both wild and captive populations in other clusters, but no significant differences were detected between the two latter groups. "
"40","wild","Captive populations predominating across North America, Europe, Africa and (to a lesser extent) Asia were closely related but markedly distinct from the geographically closest wild populations (Fig. "
"41","wild","BMC Biology (2021) 19:94 Page 10 of 22 Additional file 2), particularly wild populations from south-eastern USA (Fig. 3), is in accordance with a priori expectations regarding the geographic origin of globally most widespread captive populations. "
"42","wild","The latter form a genetically uniform group (Fig. 2) and strongly reduced genetic variance (Table 3b, Tables S3 and S5, Additional file 2) rule out substantial gene exchange with regional wild populations in the recent past. "
"43","wild","Introgression between widely farmed strains and local wild populations A better understanding of the frequency, extent and directionality of introgression between globally structured wild populations and genetically highly uniform and distinct captive strains is key to evaluate the impact of increasing global trade and large-scale BSF farming on indigenous and naturalised populations. "
"44","wild","In this context, two west African wild populations assigned to admixed clusters 2 and 16 (Figs. 1 and 3), rather than cluster 13 as expected, were identified as F1 hybrids and backcrosses with parental groups represented by west African wild populations and European captive populations (cluster 2) reportedly translocated to a nearby BSF facility 2 years prior (Figure S7, Additional file 2). "
"45","wild","Similarly, ancestry coefficients revealed that wild and captive populations from central-east Africa that were allocated to the North American cluster 16 were hybrids between parental groups originating from south-east African (cluster 11) and regionally abundant captive populations (clusters 1–3) (Figure S8, Additional file 2), with extensive backcross re-assignments documenting vast admixture across provenances in this region. "
"46","wild","While cluster 5 was inferred to be evenly admixed, including backcrosses in both directions, cluster 4 appears only marginally introgressed, with very limited genetic signatures of Asian wild populations. "
"47","wild","Several wild populations sampled across considerable distances in Africa demonstrate introgression from modern BSF farms and research facilities (Figs. 1c and 3), indicating that hybrid populations have established repeatedly in nature in this region (Fig. "
"48","wild","By contrast, all but one of the hybrid populations in Asia were captive, suggesting that more recently introduced farmed BSF have caused limited, merely local introgression into Asian wild populations. "
"49","wild","Interestingly, recent human-mediated admixture between distantly related clusters contributed to increased genetic variance between individuals within populations, as exemplified for Asian populations (Table 3b), rather than the expected increase of variance within individuals that was typically found in American wild populations. "
"50","wild","Discussion Our comprehensive population genetic study of wild and captive populations of BSF on a global scale using highly discriminating microsatellites permitted a fundamental genetic characterisation of this commercially important insect. "
"51","wild","Our data provided novel insights into (1) the geographic distribution of genetic variation and population structure of wild and captive populations; (2) the origin of specific colonisations and general patterns of range expansions across the world, including basic delimitations of historic vs. contemporary events; and (3) the genetic relationships between wild and captive populations, which exhibit genetic footprints of domestication, and local gene flow between the two. "
"52","wild","Nevertheless, southeast North American wild populations were least differentiated in conjunction with signals of admixture in Caribbean individuals (Figs. 3 and 4, Figure S5, Additional file 2), suggesting occasional gene flow from South America into south-east North America via the Caribbean islands. "
"53","wild","Patterns observed in central-eastern Africa reflect progressing introgression between south-east African wild populations and more recently introduced captive populations that are used in several large-scale farming facilities across the continent. "
"54","wild","However, an additional independent introduction of North American wild populations of cluster 16 to central-eastern Africa cannot be ruled out (Figs. 3 and 4) and is indeed supported by shared mitochondrial haplotypes between wild samples from Kenya as well as Oklahoma and Florida, USA [45]. "
"55","wild","European wild populations are all highly distinct from European captive populations and appear to stem from at least three independent introductions from the Americas plus a fourth lineage that was the result of a remarkable admixture event. "
"56","wild","Both Mediterranean populations also featured assignments to cluster 16, which suggests gene flow among them, and implies a third colonisation either from North American wild populations directly, via potential ongoing range expansions from central-east Africa into the Mediterranean, or vice versa (Fig. "
"57","wild","Moreover, despite their geographic proximity, ABC analyses indicate that neither Mediterranean population appears to have given rise to wild populations of western Europe (cluster 10 in Figs. 1 and 4). "
"58","wild","Yet, one of them is indeed uniquely shared among wild populations from western Europe and south-east Africa [45]. "
"59","wild","This founding stock most likely goes back to an establishment of approximately 20,000 wild-collected pupae in the course of some early work in 1998 in Alma, Georgia, USA [44, J.K. "
"60","wild","An early division of this captive North American gene pool, represented by cluster 2, features more diverse mitochondrial haplotypes also found in North American wild populations [45]. "
"61","wild","This may be owing to introgression from wild populations in Europe (or Africa) shortly after its introduction there around 2005, and/or stronger drift across North American captive populations during the last decade. "
"62","wild","1, Table 2): cluster 3, derived from a European breeding programme, should have experienced even more pronounced drift, while cluster 4 demonstrably involved outcrossing with Asian wild populations prior to subsequent selection. "
"63","wild","Nevertheless, descendants of cluster 1 that experienced different introgression fates on different continents (i.e. clusters 2 and 4) still prominently expressed these specific LD patterns, whereas they were absent across other populations, although D-statistics suggested that wild-derived captive populations assigned to other clusters may have been similarly affected by genome-wide demographic effects. "
"64","wild","Moreover, despite substantially decreased genetic diversity compared to native wild populations, severe inbreeding of the domesticated populations was not indicated. "
"65","wild","Impact and limitations of introgression between wild and domesticated BSF in an evolutionary ecology context Gene flow between provenances, or the lack thereof despite opportunities, allows interesting insights into the direct competitiveness of domesticated strains and wild populations in artificial settings and natural habitats. "
"66","wild","Most populations showing introgression between domesticated and wild origins were kept in captivity in non-native regions, particularly in Asia and Africa (Fig. "
"67","wild","This suggests that certain traits of local wild populations may be superior [63] in a regional BSF farming context and thus facilitate directional gene flow into recently introduced domesticated strains. "
"68","wild","Conversely and counter to expectations [52], nuclear gene flow into local wild populations was not widespread in non-native areas, where domesticated strains of North American origin are extensively used for farming (notably Africa, Asia, and Europe). "
"69","wild","This can hardly be explained by estimated effective population sizes Ne, which varied across populations but were well comparable between provenances in all regions and even tended to be lower for wild populations outside South and Central America (Tables S3 and S5, Additional file 2), and probably only to a limited extent by precautionary measures to prevent escapes with regard to ubiquitous semi-open farms [76]. "
"70","wild","Instead, biological mechanisms might limit introgression from recently introduced domesticated strains into local wild populations. "
"71","wild","Such mechanisms could explain both the absence of admixture between two distinct clusters within a single wild population in the putative contact zone in south-eastern Europe (Fig. 1c and 4), and a notable mito-nuclear discordance of captive Asian hybrid populations despite the lack of fundamental genetic incompatibilities, as implied by comparison with a previous mitochondrial phylogeography [45]. "
"72","wild","Diapause in BSF has been investigated only superficially [85], but it is likely that wild populations of cooler regions (e.g. "
"73","wild","Reinforced introgression from domesticated strains may emerge more frequently around BSF farms and research facilities [76], thereby disrupting local genetic (co)adaptations of wild populations and thus posing a threat to native but also unique naturalised populations. "
"74","wild","This benchmark of the worldwide BSF population genetic inventory will foster guided surveys of wild and mass-reared captive BSF populations, investigations of gene-by-environment interactions, explorations of phenotypic trait architectures and future breeding efforts to harness the potential of this insect for tackling socioeconomic challenges. "

"76","wild","Specifically, all populations reared in captivity (for academic research, commercial farming or hobby purposes) for more than one generation prior to collection were considered captive, irrespective of possible or even intended exchange with local wild populations, for example in semi-open facilities. "
"77","wild","For overall grouping and illustration consistency, but also because several providers of commercially used population samples wished to stay anonymous, information on geographic sample origins more detailed than at the subcontinental level are referred to only selectively whenever relevant (particularly for wild populations, see Table S1, Additional file 2).
