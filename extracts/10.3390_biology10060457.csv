"2","wild","(2) Methods: Using a combination of conventional PCR, cloning and sequencing, we investigated presence of Blastocystis along with Giardia and Cryptosporidium in 16 captive water voles sampled twice from a wildlife park. "
"3","wild","Recent investigations have focused on comparing gut microbiota of captive animals and their wild counterparts in order to assess links to the captive lifestyle [14,19–21]. "
"4","wild","Specifically, the prevalence of protozoan parasites in captive and wild water voles and their associated gut flora remain little explored. "
"5","wild","This type of information can assist in re-shaping the strategies for re-introduction programmes of voles into the wild. "
"6","wild","Study Site, Animals and Sample Preparation A conservation park situated in the Southeast, United Kingdom was the subject of this study; Wildwood Trust, Herne Bay, Kent, United Kingdom (51◦19′54.1′ ′ N 1◦07′10.1′ ′ E) is a wildlife park that houses native British wildlife, housing vertebrate and invertebrate species, that also includes a selection of non-native species that assist with the organisation’s education programme. "
"7","wild","The park aims to educate the general public on the ecology and status of resident animals in addition to participating in several conservation programmes aiming to ‘re-wild’ Britain. "
"8","wild","Previous vole-based studies of captive and wild-captured cohorts have shown similar abundances [43]. "
"9","wild","Therefore, further investigations into the presence of Blastocystis and associated microbial profiles across a range of host taxa in captivity and wild populations will hopefully shed light on the roles of protozoal colonisation and resulting impacts this may pose for conservation efforts. "
"10","wild","Institutional Review Board Statement: Some water voles in this study were part of a re-introduction project with a wildlife trust and other partners. "
"11","fitness","A common objective of animal studies has been to explore the extent of bacterial community perturbations in the gut caused by anthropogenic intervention and investigate resulting ramifications on animal fitness and longevity [13–18]. "
"12","model","Recent studies have showcased that water voles constitute an attractive model for examining these questions [22,23]. "
"13","model","This method was implemented in addition to classical univariate analysis as it is specifically designed to address normalisation and biases in measurements across taxonomic features by way of a zeroinflated Gaussian distribution model to account for the variety in sequencing depth. "
