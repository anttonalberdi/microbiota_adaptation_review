"2","wild","(2) Methods: Using a combination of conventional PCR, cloning and sequencing, we investigated presence of Blastocystis along with Giardia and Cryptosporidium in 16 captive water voles sampled twice from a wildlife park. "
"3","wild","Recent investigations have focused on comparing gut microbiota of captive animals and their wild counterparts in order to assess links to the captive lifestyle [14,19–21]. "
"4","wild","Specifically, the prevalence of protozoan parasites in captive and wild water voles and their associated gut flora remain little explored. "
"5","wild","This type of information can assist in re-shaping the strategies for re-introduction programmes of voles into the wild. "
"6","wild","Study Site, Animals and Sample Preparation A conservation park situated in the Southeast, United Kingdom was the subject of this study; Wildwood Trust, Herne Bay, Kent, United Kingdom (51◦19′54.1′ ′ N 1◦07′10.1′ ′ E) is a wildlife park that houses native British wildlife, housing vertebrate and invertebrate species, that also includes a selection of non-native species that assist with the organisation’s education programme. "
"7","wild","The park aims to educate the general public on the ecology and status of resident animals in addition to participating in several conservation programmes aiming to ‘re-wild’ Britain. "
"8","wild","Previous vole-based studies of captive and wild-captured cohorts have shown similar abundances [43]. "
"9","wild","Therefore, further investigations into the presence of Blastocystis and associated microbial profiles across a range of host taxa in captivity and wild populations will hopefully shed light on the roles of protozoal colonisation and resulting impacts this may pose for conservation efforts. "
"10","wild","Institutional Review Board Statement: Some water voles in this study were part of a re-introduction project with a wildlife trust and other partners. "
"11","fitness","A common objective of animal studies has been to explore the extent of bacterial community perturbations in the gut caused by anthropogenic intervention and investigate resulting ramifications on animal fitness and longevity [13–18]. "
"12","model","Recent studies have showcased that water voles constitute an attractive model for examining these questions [22,23]. "
"13","model","This method was implemented in addition to classical univariate analysis as it is specifically designed to address normalisation and biases in measurements across taxonomic features by way of a zeroinflated Gaussian distribution model to account for the variety in sequencing depth. "
"14","disease","Simple Summary: The last decade has seen a large increase into research on the microbiome and its roles in health and disease. "
"15","disease","However, there is evidence to suggest that microbial eukaryotes colonising the gastrointestinal tract may have roles in the shaping and structuring of the microbiota and are thus likely to influence disease outcomes and host health. "
"16","disease","Recently, there has been an explosion of studies focusing on the microbiome and its role in host health and disease. "
"17","disease","The animals are also monitored for presence of infectious disease agents. "
"18","disease","At the time of study all voles were considered healthy as stated by a licenced veterinarian and lacked symptoms of gastrointestinal disease. "
"19","disease","The water vole that died from unknown causes on the morning of the second collection had a high abundance of Proteobacteria, which is often associated with dysbiosis in animal studies including humans, where it has been linked to both intestinal related diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, as well as extraintestinal disease possibly indicating a disruption of enteric homeostasis [54–58]. "
"20","human","Abstract: (1) Background: Blastocystis is a microbial eukaryote inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of a broad range of animals including humans. "
"21","human","Nonetheless, these studies are focused almost exclusively on humans, while there is no similar information on other animals. "
"22","human","(4) Conclusion: Unlike human investigations, Blastocystis does not seem to be associated with specific gut microbial profiles in water voles. "
"23","human","Microbiome-based research of non-human vertebrates mainly encompasses livestock [7–9], companion animals [10,11] and other notable species, such as those at risk of extinction [12,13]. "
"24","human","In general, studies in humans and rodents have shown that Bacteroidetes-driven microbiota may be the result of low fat/high fibre diet [47–50]. "
"25","human","The water vole that died from unknown causes on the morning of the second collection had a high abundance of Proteobacteria, which is often associated with dysbiosis in animal studies including humans, where it has been linked to both intestinal related diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, as well as extraintestinal disease possibly indicating a disruption of enteric homeostasis [54–58]. "
"26","human","A negative association with Bacteroides and presence of Blastocystis has been consistently found across human studies [64–67]. "
"27","human","Presence of this protist has also been linked to a decrease in Hymenolepis nana, which has been associated with alterations in the microbiota [70,71], these results led to the hypothesis that Blastocystis is part of the healthy intestinal microbiome in humans. "
"28","human","Contrary to this, a single study focusing on chimpanzees demonstrated that bearing Blastocystis was associated with decreased microbial richness and decline in the ‘protective’ species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and increase in Enterobacteriaceae, a marker of poor intestinal health in humans [62]. "
"29","human","Herein, contrary to the human studies, we found no significant differences between the microbial profiles of water voles with and without Blastocystis. "
"30","human","A possible explanation could be that the presence of Blastocystis in water voles might not have the same associations as those observed in humans. "
"31","human","In support of this, Treponema has been found in significantly higher abundances in the gut of humans living in rural areas and eating fibre-rich diets, while it is typically absent in urbanites consuming fibre-poor diets [73,74]. "
