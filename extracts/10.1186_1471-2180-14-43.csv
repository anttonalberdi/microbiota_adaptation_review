"1","wild","Keywords: Bacterial community sequencing, Exotic felids, Wildlife conservation, Zoo nutritionBackground In the broad scope of wildlife conservation with the aim to protect animal species from extinction, researchers and zoo managers face significant challenges in the conservation of threatened and endangered species. "
"2","wild","Extrapolations of the dietary profile of the domestic cat to wild felids in captivity have been made [8,9] but are highly debatable since great differences exist in regards to their anatomical, behavioral and nutritional characteristics. "
"3","wild","Using a variety of methods, Bacteroidetes have been identified as a dominant group in the faecal microbiota of dogs (27-34%) fed experimental diets (30% protein and 20% fat) [38,39], wild wolves (16,9%) feeding on raw meat [40] and grizzly bears (40%) on an omnivorous diet [41]. "
"4","wild","The latter study indicated that captive grizzly bears consuming a protein-based diet were more prone to carry C. perfringens than wild grizzly bears consuming a more plant-based diet. "
"5","wild","Also in two other studies both using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries to study the faecal microbiota of wild wolves [40] and pet cats [50], no Bifidobacteriaceae were encountered. "

"7","wild","Zhang HH, Chen L: Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences reveals distal gut bacterial diversity in wild wolves (Canis lupus). "
"8","adaptat","Due to diet-induced evolutionary adaptations, cats have developed a strictly carnivorous lifestyle with unique nutrient requirements [7]. "
"9","adaptat","However, because the number of captive animals available for well-documented faecal sample collection is extremely limited and because the composition and the functional capacity of the cheetah microbiota is virtually unknown, it has not been possible to link these observations to specific bacterial shifts or adaptations in the intestinal ecosystem. "
"10","adaptat","In addition, direct extrapolation of microbiological insights obtained for the domestic cat is not a valid approach given its adaptation to commercial diets. "
"11","adaptat","Morris JG: Idiosyncratic nutrient requirements of cats appear to be diet-induced evolutionary adaptations. "
"12","model","Thus, our results question the role of the domestic cat as the best available model for nutritional intervention studies in endangered exotic felids. "
"13","model","In addition to the apparent differences in feeding habbits between both felid species, also our microbiological findings thus question the role of the domestic cat as a suitable model for nutritional intervention studies in captive felids such as cheetahs. "
