"2","wild","However, Atlantic salmon stocked juveniles show higher mortality rates than wild ones when introduced into nature. "
"3","wild","Hatchery environment, which greatly differs from the natural environment, is identified as the main driver of the phenotypic mismatch between captive and wild parrs. "
"4","wild","We hypothesized that hatcheryraised parrs potentially recruit gut microbial communities that are different from those recruited in the wild. "
"5","wild","Striking differences between hatchery and wildborn parrs’ gut microbiota suggest that microbiota could be another factor that could impact their survival in the targeted river, because the microbiome is narrowly related to host physiology. "
"6","wild","For instance, major commensals belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiacea from wild parrs’ gut microbiota were substituted in captive parrs by lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family. "
"7","wild","Overall, captive parrs host a generalist bacterial community whereas wild parrs’ microbiota is much more specialized. "
"8","wild","This is the very first study demonstrating extensive impact of captive rearing on intestinal microbiota composition in Atlantic salmon intended for wild population stocking. "
"9","wild","However, several studies show that stocking methods do not meet expected results as hatcheryborn fish exhibit significantly inferior survival rates (from 0.1% to 0.5%) compared to their wildborn relatives (4%): (Ford, 2002; Kristiansen, Ottera, & Svasand, 2000; Stringwell et al., 2014; Svasand & Kristiansen, 1990), in addition to a lower fitness (Araki, Berejikian, Ford, & Blouin, 2008; Milot et al., 2013). "
"10","wild","Overall, physiology of stocked salmon is different than that of wild ones (Poole et al., 2003; Stringwell et al., 2014), but it is still unclear how the physiological mismatch takes place between hatcheryand wildborn individuals. "
"11","wild","Several factors may contribute to these unsuccessful results, such as a strong local adaptation of wildborn salmon to natural conditions (Dionne, Caron, Dodson, & Bernatchez, 2008; Perrier, Bourret, Kent, & Bernatchez, 2013), even though juveniles are generated with wild breeders captured from the targeted river in order to provide hatcheryborn juveniles with genetic adaptations from the targeted wild population. "
"12","wild","Despite a genetic composition issued from the wild population, phenotypic mismatch remains in stocked parrs. "
"13","wild","The two populations are subjected to conservation stocking, for which juveniles are reared in hatchery until they reach the stage of 0+ parrs before being released into the wild. "
"14","wild","Captive 0+ parrs, issued from wild breeders and reared in Tadoussac Hatchery (Quebec, Canada), have been sampled and compared to their wild relatives. "
"15","wild","By hypothesizing that parrs’ gut microbiota composition is influenced more by rearing environment than breeder’s genotype, this study aimed to      |  1673LAVOIE Et AL. (a) characterize environmental microbiota from hatchery and river waters, (b) characterize the gut microbiota composition from captive and wildborn parrs from the same genetic population (i.e., Rimouski or Malbaie), and (c) identify symbionts that are specific either to hatcheryor wildborn parrs’ gut microbiota. "
"16","wild","Three predictions were made as follows: (a) Environmental microbial communities would significantly differ between the two rivers and the hatchery water, (b) gut microbiota composition of captive and wildborn parrs from the same genetic population would significantly differ, and (c) exclusive taxa would be found in both hatcheryand wildborn parrs’ gut microbiota. "
"17","wild","For instance, captive parrs’ microbiota hosts mainly Lactobacillaceae whereas their wild relatives host mainly Enterobacteriaceae. "
"18","wild","Consequently, stocked parrs’ gut microbiota may not confer the same metabolic functions as their wild relatives. "
"19","wild","Although further investigations are needed to understand how the divergence of the gut microbiota between the reared parrs’ microbiota and their wild relatives will affect their survival in the wild, it is now clear that host–microbiome interactions must not be neglected for stocking programs. "
"20","wild","According to their time of capture, wild breeders from Malbaie and Rimouski rivers were kept in captivity for a period ranging from 2 months to 5 years before spawning. "
"21","wild","During incubation, water temperature was set according to the “modified natural thermal regime” to mimic the natural growth rate of wild salmon juveniles. "
"22","wild","A total of 27 parrs were sampled: five wild parrs from the Rimouski river, six wild parrs from the Malbaie river, eight captive parrs from the Rimouski population, and eight captive parrs from the Malbaie population. "
"23","wild","This test allowed us to visualize the dispersion of the microbiota taxonomic structure within captive and wild parrs’ samples. "
"24","wild","3.1 | Microbiota structure analysis Analysis of the alphadiversity (Shannon index) of the gut microbiota (Figure 1a) showed that captivebred parrs housed a much more diversified microbiota than wild parrs. "
"25","wild","Malbaie wild parrs (MWP) (mean Shannon index: 2.12) exhibited an intermediate richness between Malbaie captivebred parrs and Rimouski wild parrs. "

"
"28","wild","However, individual gut microbiota from wildborn parrs from both populations are not connected to each other and, more importantly, are either loosely (RWP) or not (MWP) related at all to their respective captive relatives. "
"29","wild","At last, wildborn parrs mean Spearman coefficient correlation was higher for RWP (mean coefficient: 0.800) than for MWP samples (mean coefficient: 0.461), suggesting lower microbiota compositional homogeneity in MWP when compared to RWP. "
"30","wild","Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) either based on unweighted (Figure 2a) or weighted (Figure 2b) UniFrac distances showed a clustering of individual gut microbiota according to the origin of the fish: Captivebred parrs are grouped, whereas wild parrs’ populations are differentiated from one another and from their captive relatives.

"32","wild","Moreover, diversity index was higher for captive parrs when compared to wild parrs (Figure 1a). "
"33","wild","Taken together, these results show that dominant OTUs were less abundant in captive parrs than in their wild relatives (see relative abundance of the twenty most abundant OTUs in Appendix 1). "
"34","wild","At last, the two dominant taxa that were shared between captive and wild parrs for both populations belong to Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. "
"35","wild","Then, Streptococcaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae were found in captive and wild parrs from Malbaie population, and both Planococcaceae and Bacillaceae were shared by captive and wild parrs from Rimouski (Figure 5). "

"
"40","wild","Hatcheryreared parrs were generated with breeders issued from two wild populations (i.e., Rimouski and Malbaie rivers), whereas wild parrs were naturally born and grown in their respective rivers. "
"41","wild","It has also been demonstrated that reared fish show a different methylation pattern than that of their wild relatives (Le Luyer et al., 2017). "
"42","wild","By identifying significant differences in terms of both structure and taxonomic composition between captive parrs and their wild relatives, the present work evidenced that acclimation to artificial rearing is also observable at the host–microbiota level. "
"43","wild","Environment is an important driver for gut microbiota structuration and composition: Compared to wild parrs, hatcheryreared parrs exhibited a higher bacterial diversity (Figure 1), combined with lower disparity (i.e., most of OTU sharing similar relative abundance), both of which are characteristic of an immature microbial community with low structuration (Burns et al., 2016; Llewellyn et al., 2015; Sylvain & Derome, 2017).

"
"47","wild","Taken together, our results suggest that captive parrs’ microbiota composition would therefore be qualified as “generalist” when compared to the highly structured and, thus more specialized, wild parrs’ gut microbiota. "
"48","wild","This more specialized gut microbiota in wild parrs can be attributed to the higher selective pressures occurring in wild rivers, including a more restricted diet, which is mostly composed of insects’ larvae, crustacean, and annelids (Bell, Ghioni, & Sargent, 1994). "
"49","wild","Therefore, controlling gut microbial symbionts in hatchery could be of prime interest to secure the recruitment of key adaptive microbiota functions of wild parrs. "
"50","wild","Regarding both wildborn parrs’ populations, gut microbiota composition significantly differed accordingly to their population origin, thus confirming our previous work on wild populations, stating that gut microbiota composition at early life stages is mostly driven by geography (study site) (Llewellyn et al., 2015). "
"51","wild","The top 5 OTUs from wild parrs are distinct, and no OTU from the top 5 is shared between the two groups. "
"52","wild","At last, sanitary management in hatcheries, due to high density, impairs microbial environment and gut microbiota (Carlson, Leonard, Hyde, Petrosino, & Primm, 2017; Nakayama et al., 2017), thus amplifying microbiota divergence between hatcheryand wildborn parrs. "
"53","wild","In addition to the phenotypic mismatch between captive and wild salmonids from the same genetic population (Araki et al., 2008; Milot et al., 2013; Poole et al., 2003; Stringwell et al., 2014), hatcheryraised parrs are also facing an important microbiota mismatch regarding key microbial symbionts recruited by their wild relatives. "
"54","wild","Knowing that their gut microbiota composition differs from that of wild parrs, exposure to a very different environmental microbial community could lead to an impairment of colonization resistance to wild opportunistic pathogens, thus potentially favoring disease. "
"55","wild","At last, overdominance of Lactobacillaceae in captive parrs is expected to generate a reduced capacity to assimilate nutrients from wild preys. "
"56","wild","Furthermore, Rhossart et al. (2017) demonstrated that host fitnesspromoting traits regarding naturally occurring diseases were associated with the “natural microbiome” of wild mice. "
"57","wild","Indeed, domestic microbiota was associated with greater inflammation and lower resistance to pathogens relatively to wild individual microbiota. "
"58","wild","Because the microbiota composition is proven to be actively involved in several metabolism pathways (Tremaroli & Bäckhed, 2012) and immune responses (Rhossart et al., 2017), investigating the relationship between the host energetic phenotype and the microbiome functional repertoire of captive and wild parrs is crucial to assess to what extent the gut microbiota taxonomic mismatch is actually associated to the loss of microbial functions. "
"59","wild","Therefore, further studies are strongly needed to test whether the taxonomic (and functional) microbial mismatch between hatcheryraised and wildborn salmons could underlie the lower survival of stocked fishes once released into the wild. "
"60","wild","Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the extensive discrepancy between hatcheryraised and wild parrs’ gut microbiota potentially translates into a phenotypic disadvantage for the former, at least regarding disease resistance and food energetic conversion. "
"61","wild","Indeed, the two most important symbionts of the wild parrs’ gut microbiota such as Enterobacteriaceae (MWP, RWP) and Clostridiaceae (MWP only) are at very low levels in most captive parrs (Figure 5) as well as the top 5 OTUs from wild parrs (Figure 6). "
"62","wild","Therefore, stocked parrs could have developed different metabolic functions from their wild relatives, regardless of their common genetic origin, which could considerably reduce their fitness in natural conditions. "
"63","wild","Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to test whether such generalist microbiome from captive parrs provides or not key functions ensuring optimal host physiology in the wild. "
"64","wild","5  | CONCLUSION Given that parrs’ gut microbiota composition is strongly related to the rearing environment, differences in terms of structure and composition between wild and hatcheryborn parrs give valuable information toward improving management of reared fish intended for stocking. "
"65","wild","Consequently, it becomes even more crucial to investigate the link between environmental and gut microbial communities’ taxonomic composition to get new insights on factors driving differences between captive and wild parrs’ microbiota and therefore      |  1681LAVOIE Et AL. their adaptive ability in a given environment.

"
"86","adaptation","As genetic structure of natural population showed evidence of local adaptation for Atlantic salmon (Dionne et al., 2008; Garcia de Leaniz et al., 2007), it is expected that the genetically controlled gut microbiota is also involved in local adaptation (Dionne et al., 2007). "
