"
"4","wild","Carnobacterium maltaromaticum was the most abundant bacterial species from both the wild and laboratory-reared larvae. "
"5","wild","The most abundant OTUs in the wild ghost moth populations were Carnobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae for bacteria, and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota for fungi. "
"6","wild","Larval microbial communities of the wild ghost moth from different geographic locations were not significantly different from each other but significant difference in larval microbial community was detected between the wild and laboratory-reared ghost moth. "
"7","wild","The larval gut of the wild ghost moth was dominated by the culturable Carnobacterium. "
"8","wild","Furthermore, the larval gut of the wild ghost moth had a significantly higher abundance of Ophiocordyceps but lower abundance of Candida and Aspergillus than that of the laboratory-reared ghost moth. "
