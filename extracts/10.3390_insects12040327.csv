"137","laboratory","When compared with the wild ghost moth larvae, the gut bacteria of laboratoryreared ghost moth larvae showed a significant increase in the abundance of Wolbachia and Rhizobium (Figure 6). "
"138","laboratory","However, factors that resulted in significantly increased abundance of Wolbachia in the laboratory-reared ghost moth, especially in GG population, and the function of Wolbachia probably involved in the artificial rearing process are still unknown. "
"139","laboratory","In addition, some gut-associated bacterial genera also detected the increased abundance in the laboratory-reared ghost moth, for instance, Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium in SD population, and Serratia in XJ population. "
"140","laboratory","Therefore, the increased abundance in the laboratory-reared ghost moth should be carefully considered. "
"141","laboratory","However, significantly decreased abundance of O. sinensis and increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens Aspergillus and Candida were found in the laboratory-reared ghost moth populations. "
"142","laboratory","Interestingly, the most common pathogen I. farinosa was not detected in the gut of both the wild and laboratory-reared ghost moth. "
"143","laboratory","The results demonstrated that gut microbiota of the wild and laboratoryreared ghost moth populations greatly differed. "
"144","laboratory","The wild ghost moth larvae had a significantly higher abundance of Carnobacterium bacteria and Ophiocordyceps fungi in the gut compared with the laboratory-reared larvae. "
"145","laboratory","The gut of the laboratory-reared larvae was enriched by Wolbachia and other opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Serratia, Pseudomonas, and Flavobacterium, as well as opportunistic pathogenic fungi Aspergillus and Candida. "
"146","laboratory","These findings will help improve the effectiveness of the laboratory-reared Thitarodes hosts for the cultivation of the Chinese cordyceps, by selecting beneficial probiotics from the gut microbiota. "
