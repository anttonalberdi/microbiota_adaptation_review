"1","wild","Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed few to no significant differentially expressed genes between gravity and the LSMMG conditions in the wild type or mutant V. fischeri at exponential or stationary phase. "
"2","wild","RESULTS Overview of transcriptome analysis of V. fischeri cultivars under gravity and LSMMG conditions RNA-seq was used to evaluate the transcriptional changes of wild type V. fischeri ES114 (WT) and a Δhfq deletion mutant (KV7142) at two key time points during bacterial growth. "

"6","fitness","Together, these results improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which microgravity alters the physiology of beneficial host-associated microbes. npj Microgravity (2018) 4:25 ; doi:10.1038/s41526-018-0060-1 INTRODUCTION All animals form beneficial relationships with microbes.1 The normal microbiota of animals is extremely important for maintaining almost every aspect of animal fitness including host development, behavior, and immune system homeostasis.2,3 Understanding how these beneficial microbes respond to their continually changing environments represents an important area in animal microbiome research.
