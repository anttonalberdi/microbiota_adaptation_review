"1","wild","This is the first demonstration that manipulating the natural skin microbiota of an amphibian species can alter the pathogen’s negative effects on infected amphibians and appears to be the first demonstration that an epibiotic manipulation of any wildlife species can lessen the effects of an emerging infectious disease. "
"2","wild","This is the first approach suggested that could slow or halt epidemic outbreaks and allow successful reintroductions of amphibian species that have become locally or globally extinct in the wild. "
"3","wild","Manipulation of amphibians’ cutaneous microbiota is currently the only suggested approach that offers the potential of slowing or halting epidemic outbreaks in the field and that can allow successful reintroductions of species that have become locally or globally extinct in the wild. "
