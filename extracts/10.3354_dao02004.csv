"1","wild","This is the first demonstration that manipulating the natural skin microbiota of an amphibian species can alter the pathogen’s negative effects on infected amphibians and appears to be the first demonstration that an epibiotic manipulation of any wildlife species can lessen the effects of an emerging infectious disease. "
"2","wild","This is the first approach suggested that could slow or halt epidemic outbreaks and allow successful reintroductions of amphibian species that have become locally or globally extinct in the wild. "
"3","wild","Manipulation of amphibians’ cutaneous microbiota is currently the only suggested approach that offers the potential of slowing or halting epidemic outbreaks in the field and that can allow successful reintroductions of species that have become locally or globally extinct in the wild. "
"4","wild","LITERATURE CITED Belden LK, Harris RN (2007) Infectious diseases in wildlife: the community ecology context. "
"5","disease","The disease is caused by a chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), that inhabits amphibian skin. "
"6","disease","Progress has been made in understanding the pathogen’s life cycle, documenting its devastating effects on individual amphibians and on populations, and understanding how and why disease outbreaks occur. "
"7","disease","No research has directly addressed the critical question of how to prevent declines and extinctions caused by outbreaks of the disease. "
"8","disease","Here, we demonstrate that a species of anti-Bd skin bacteria can be successfully added to skins of salamanders Plethodon cinereus, and that addition of this bacterium reduced the severity of a disease symptom in experimentally infected individuals. "
"9","disease","This is the first demonstration that manipulating the natural skin microbiota of an amphibian species can alter the pathogen’s negative effects on infected amphibians and appears to be the first demonstration that an epibiotic manipulation of any wildlife species can lessen the effects of an emerging infectious disease. "
"10","disease","It suggests that probiotic or bio-augmentation manipulations of cutaneous microbiota could have the potential to reduce susceptibility of amphibians to the disease in nature. "
"11","disease","For example, climate change, pesticides, and antibiotics could alter the community composition of amphibian skin bacteria and leave them susceptible to disease outbreaks (Belden & Harris 2007). "
"12","disease","Alternatively, adding or augmenting an anti-Bd species might lessen the effects of the disease, which include death and sub-lethal effects, such as weight loss (Davidson et al. "
"13","disease","In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of antifungal skin bacteria to amphibians before exposure to Bd will enhance survival or lessen sub-lethal effects of the disease, such as weight loss. "
"14","disease","Recent progress in the use of ‘bacterial replacement therapy’ in humans suggests that alternations of the bacterial community can limit or prevent disease (Tagg & Dierksen 2003). "

"19","environment","In addition, the spraying of antifungal chemicals in the environment could negatively affect native fungi and associated plant life. "
"20","environment","Of course, the demonstration of a positive effect on survival of infected amphibians, tests on more species, including anuran species, and additional environmental testing in more complex environments are needed before implementation can be considered. "
"21","human","Certain community profiles of the microbiota may be associated with pathogen resistance in amphibians, as in humans (Blaser 2006, Dethlefsen et al. "

"25","laboratory","Salamanders were taken to the laboratory on 10 April 2006 and individuals were weighed in individual sterile Petri plates. "
"26","laboratory","The strict randomization in this experiment, such as random assignment of individuals to treatments and treatments to physical locations within the laboratory incubators, strongly suggests that statistically significant differences in weight loss were caused by treatment differences.
