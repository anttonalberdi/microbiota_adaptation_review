"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","In this study, Karasov et al. show that in populations of a wild plant, no single lineage of an abundant pathogen takes over the host population. "
"2","wild","To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild pathosystems, we carried out a multi-year, multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in its natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. "
"3","wild","Our results suggest that selective pressures acting on a plant pathogen in wild hosts are likely to be much more complex than those in agricultural systems. "
"4","wild","Arabidopsis thaliana is a globally distributed wild plant capable of colonizing poor substrates as well as fertilized soils (Weigel, 2012). "
"5","wild","We were surprised to find a single dominant Pseudomonas lineage in the study area, given that wild A. thaliana populations can be colonized by a diversity of Pseudomonas pathogenic species. "
"6","wild","Maladaptation in wild populations of the generalist plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. "
"7","fitness","There is differentiation at the level of both gene content and disease phenotype, although the differentiation may not provide fitness advantages to specific sublineages. "
"8","fitness","Pseudomonas can have a large impact on plant fitness (Balestra et al., 2009; Yunis et al., 1980), and several putatively host-adapted lineages, which are distinguished by the repertoire of disease-causing genes, can trigger agricultural disease epidemics (Baltrus et al., 2011, 2012). "
"9","fitness","16S rDNA analysis might indicate that a pathogen dominates the microbiota, but unless it reaches a certain absolute level, there might not be a marked decrease in host fitness (Duchmann et al., 1995; Schneider and Ayres, 2008; Vaughn et al., 2000). "
"10","fitness","Effector proteins increase bacterial fitness in different ways (Chen et al., 2010; Xin et al., 2016) and are thought to be at the forefront of the coevolutionary interaction with the plant immune system (Karasov et al., 2014b). "
"11","fitness","DspE, an AvrE homolog in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora, functions similarly to AvrE (Bogdanove et al., 1998), pointing to many pathogens relying on the AvrE mechanism to enhance their fitness. "
"12","fitness","The Pseudomonas syringae Hrp pathogenicity island has a tripartite mosaic structure composed of a cluster of type III secretion genes bounded by exchangeable effector and conserved effector loci that contribute to parasitic fitness and pathogenicity in plants. "
"13","adaptation","Maladaptation in wild populations of the generalist plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. "
