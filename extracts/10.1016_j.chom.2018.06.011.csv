"1","wild","In this study, Karasov et al. show that in populations of a wild plant, no single lineage of an abundant pathogen takes over the host population. "
"2","wild","To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild pathosystems, we carried out a multi-year, multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in its natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. "
"3","wild","Our results suggest that selective pressures acting on a plant pathogen in wild hosts are likely to be much more complex than those in agricultural systems. "
"4","wild","Arabidopsis thaliana is a globally distributed wild plant capable of colonizing poor substrates as well as fertilized soils (Weigel, 2012). "
"5","wild","We were surprised to find a single dominant Pseudomonas lineage in the study area, given that wild A. thaliana populations can be colonized by a diversity of Pseudomonas pathogenic species. "
"6","wild","Maladaptation in wild populations of the generalist plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. "
"7","fitness","There is differentiation at the level of both gene content and disease phenotype, although the differentiation may not provide fitness advantages to specific sublineages. "
"8","fitness","Pseudomonas can have a large impact on plant fitness (Balestra et al., 2009; Yunis et al., 1980), and several putatively host-adapted lineages, which are distinguished by the repertoire of disease-causing genes, can trigger agricultural disease epidemics (Baltrus et al., 2011, 2012). "
"9","fitness","16S rDNA analysis might indicate that a pathogen dominates the microbiota, but unless it reaches a certain absolute level, there might not be a marked decrease in host fitness (Duchmann et al., 1995; Schneider and Ayres, 2008; Vaughn et al., 2000). "
"10","fitness","Effector proteins increase bacterial fitness in different ways (Chen et al., 2010; Xin et al., 2016) and are thought to be at the forefront of the coevolutionary interaction with the plant immune system (Karasov et al., 2014b). "
"11","fitness","DspE, an AvrE homolog in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora, functions similarly to AvrE (Bogdanove et al., 1998), pointing to many pathogens relying on the AvrE mechanism to enhance their fitness. "
"12","fitness","The Pseudomonas syringae Hrp pathogenicity island has a tripartite mosaic structure composed of a cluster of type III secretion genes bounded by exchangeable effector and conserved effector loci that contribute to parasitic fitness and pathogenicity in plants. "
"13","adaptat","Maladaptation in wild populations of the generalist plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. "
"14","model","While several soybean cultivars can recognize the activity of AvrE (Kobayashi et al., 1989), gene-forgene resistance to the avrE-containing Pst DC3000 model pathogen has so far not been found in A. thaliana (Velásquez et al., 2017). "
"15","model","Gene prediction with a hidden Markov model and a new intron submodel. "
"16","model","We predicted genes on the raw genome FASTA sequences using AUGUSTUS-3.3 (Stanke and Waack, 2003) and –genemodel = partial –gff3 = on –species = E_coli_K12 settings. "
"17","model","Core-genome phylogenies of the strains were constructed using RAxML (Stamatakis et al., 2005) using the gamma model of rate heterogeneity and the generalized time reversible model of substitution. "

"
"20","disease","There is differentiation at the level of both gene content and disease phenotype, although the differentiation may not provide fitness advantages to specific sublineages. "
"21","disease","Pseudomonas can have a large impact on plant fitness (Balestra et al., 2009; Yunis et al., 1980), and several putatively host-adapted lineages, which are distinguished by the repertoire of disease-causing genes, can trigger agricultural disease epidemics (Baltrus et al., 2011, 2012). "
"22","disease","Pseudomonas is commonly found on and in A. thaliana leaves, and many of these strains can cause disease, even though they are likely not specialized on A. thaliana as a host (Barrett et al., 2011; Jakob et al., 2002; Kniskern et al., 2011). "
"23","disease","(B) Examples of OTU5 strains that can reduce growth and even cause obvious disease symptoms in gnotobiotic hosts. "
"24","disease","Because some infection characteristics are determined by the presence of a single or few genes, even closely related strains can cause diverse types of disease (Kniskern et al., 2011). "
"25","disease","To directly determine the pathogenicity—which we define here as the ability to cause disease in the laboratory—of diverse OTU5 isolates, we drip-inoculated 26 of them on seedlings of Eyach 15-2, an A. thaliana genotype common at one of our sampling sites (Bomblies et al., 2010) (Figures 3B, 3C, 4A, and S6). "
"26","disease","Treatment of seedlings with boiled, dead bacteria from five different OTU5 isolates did not reduce plant growth (ANOVA, p > 0.25 for all), indicating that disease symptoms were not due to run-away immunity triggered by the initial inoculation, but were indeed caused by proliferation of living bacteria. "
"27","disease","It is reasonable to hypothesize that the host has evolved mechanisms that suppress the disease effect of OTU5. "
"28","disease","In natural populations, pathogenic effects appear to be mitigated, since we isolated OTU5 strains from plants that did not appear to be heavily diseased. "
"29","disease","Understanding mechanisms of disease mitigation in response to OTU5 will provide insight into how natural plant populations can blunt the effects of a common pathogen without instigating an arms race, and thereby suggest possible innovations to approaching disease protection in agriculture.

"35","disease","Dengue viremia titer, antibody response pattern, and virus serotype correlate with disease severity. "
"36","disease","Genetic diversity and disease control in rice. "
"37","environment","For example, if a pathogen persists at high numbers in nonhost environments, does each host become infected by a different pathogen strain? "
"38","environment","Several studies over the past 20 years have attempted to infer the distributions of non-epidemic pathogens in both host and non-host environments (Falkinham et al., 2015; Wiehlmann et al., 2007). "
"39","environment","But despite the damage they can do to plants, Pseudomonas pathogens are not obligatory biotrophs: surveys in environmental and non-host habitats have revealed distributionor(s). "
"40","environment","It was shared with other P. syringae type isolates (Dillion et al., 2017), but found rarely outside this group. avrE encodes an effector that leads to increased humidity of the extracellular environment inside the plant, the apoplast (Xin et al., 2016). "
"41","environment","DISCUSSION In human medicine, an understanding of differences between simplified clinical settings and more complex environments outside the clinic, which are often distinguished by levels of antibiotic treatment, has led to important innovations in the treatment of infections (Bakken et al., 2011). "
"42","environment","Industrial agricultural fields are often planted with one or a few closely related crop genotypes, and environmental variation in these fields is reduced by fertilization prior to planting. "
"43","environment","The resulting uniformity of the field and host environment is known to influence the microbiota (Figuerola et al., 2015), and to promote the expansions of single pathogens (Zhu et al., 2000). "
"44","environment","Indeed, several environmental and genetic factors are known to affect the pathogenic effect of microbes, including the physiological state of the plant (MacQueen and Bergelson, 2016) and the presence of other microbiota (Mendes et al., 2011). "
"45","environment","Modulation of R-gene expression across environments. "
"46","human","The importance of absolute microbial load has recently come into focus of human gut microbiome analyses as well (Vandeputte et al., 2017). "
"47","human","DISCUSSION In human medicine, an understanding of differences between simplified clinical settings and more complex environments outside the clinic, which are often distinguished by levels of antibiotic treatment, has led to important innovations in the treatment of infections (Bakken et al., 2011).

"48","laboratory","To directly determine the pathogenicity—which we define here as the ability to cause disease in the laboratory—of diverse OTU5 isolates, we drip-inoculated 26 of them on seedlings of Eyach 15-2, an A. thaliana genotype common at one of our sampling sites (Bomblies et al., 2010) (Figures 3B, 3C, 4A, and S6). "
"49","laboratory","We note, though, that while the OTU5 strains share many genetic features, they are not necessarily functionally synonymous—instead, they are differentiated both at the level of gene content and the level of pathogenicity in our laboratoryassay. "
