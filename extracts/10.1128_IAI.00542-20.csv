"1","wild","Assessment of chicken colonization revealed that the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain partially rescued the colonization defect of the IA3902 ΔluxS strain, while the W7 ΔmetAB ΔluxS strain showed significantly decreased colonization compared to that of the wild-type and the W7 ΔluxS strain. "
"2","wild","3A and B demonstrate that the growth of mutant strains is normal relative to that of wild-type strains. "
"3","wild","Significant phenotypic differences (P  0.05) between wild-type strains and muFIG 2 Mutant constructs of Campylobacter jejuni IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB strains, corresponding to the depicted genome. "
"4","wild","The IA3902 ΔluxS and W7 ΔluxS strains had significantly decreased average motility (P  0.05) compared to that of their respective wild-type strains, as previously reported (10, 13), with both new IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB mutant constructs also exhibiting a statistically significant decreased motility compared to that of both wild-type strains (P  0.05). "
"5","wild","Transcription of metAB was significantly increased (P  0.05) when FIG 3 Shaking growth curve of the IA3902 wild type (WT), W7 WT, and isogenic mutants reveal that growth is normal (mean  standard error of the mean [SEM]). "
"6","wild","The fold change in expression levels of metAB in the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain increased by 13.31-fold (standard error of the mean [SEM], 2.94) over that of the W7 wild type. "
"7","wild","Additionally, IA3902 wild-type and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB strains had no metAB mRNA transcription detected beyond the threshold cycle (CT) level cutoff 35, which indicated that metAB was not expressed in these strains. "
"8","wild","Thus, both W7 wild-type and IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strains were confirmed to transcribe metAB, while IA3902 and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB strains had no metAB transcription detected. "
"9","wild","The results of the SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated similar protein profiles between wild-type strains and the mutant constructs, confirming that these strains were harvested at a similar growth phase (see Fig. "
"10","wild","Respective wild-type (WT) strains and isogenic mutant strains were normalized to the same A600 of 0.300 and inoculated on 0.4% motility soft agar medium, and the average distance of motility was measured at 30 h of incubation at 42ºC under microaerobic conditions. "
"11","wild","Both IA3902 ΔluxS and W7 ΔluxS strains showed reduced average L-met concentrations compared to those of their respective wild-type strains, but the difference was not statistically significant (P  0.05). "

"13","wild","For both panels A and B, significance versus all other strains is denoted by *, while significance (P  0.05) versus the W7 wild-type (WT) only is denoted by **. "
"14","wild","As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the W7 ΔluxS strain maintained an ability to colonize chickens similar to W7 wild-type levels at each day postinoculation (dpi) time point, showing no statistical difference (P  0.05). "
"15","wild","In contrast, IA3902 ΔluxS strain colonization abolishment to below the limit of detection was observed at each dpi point and was statistically different (P  0.05) compared to that of the IA3902 wild type. "
"16","wild","The colonization level was significantly (P  0.05) higher than that of the IA3902 ΔluxS parent strain at each dpi point but was still below the level of the IA3902 wild type, indicating that the complementary effect of metAB was partial. "
"17","wild","The observation that colonization patterns of the W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB strain did not match colonization patterns of complete abolishment seen in the IA3902 ΔluxS strain, nor did the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain completely restore cecum colonization levels seen in the W7 ΔluxS and the wild-type strains, suggests that there are additional factors that contribute to colonization differences between these C. jejuni strains. "
"18","wild","DISCUSSION The major conclusions of the current study demonstrate that redundancy of L-met biosynthesis via the presence of metAB in W7 but not IA3902 at least partially explains the differences in colonization ability previously observed between luxS-deficient muFIG 6 Weekly chicken cecal colonization levels by wild-type (WT) strains and isogenic mutants at 5 dpi (week 1), 12 dpi (week 2), and 19 dpi (week 3) (geometric mean  SEM). "
"19","wild","However, this phenotype is most similar to our IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB mutant, whereby colonization was still present but was significantly decreased compared to the wild type, rather than to the W7 ΔluxS strain, which demonstrates no alteration in colonization ability. "
"20","wild","Partial recovery of colonization in the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain could also be due to a negative feedback loop of SAM due to an influx of excessive L-met feeding into the AMC, as our mutant was determined to overproduce both AMC products compared to wild-type IA3902 in vitro (Fig. "
