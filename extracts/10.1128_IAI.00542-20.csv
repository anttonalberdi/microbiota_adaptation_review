"1","wild","Assessment of chicken colonization revealed that the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain partially rescued the colonization defect of the IA3902 ΔluxS strain, while the W7 ΔmetAB ΔluxS strain showed significantly decreased colonization compared to that of the wild-type and the W7 ΔluxS strain. "

"4","wild","The IA3902 ΔluxS and W7 ΔluxS strains had significantly decreased average motility (P  0.05) compared to that of their respective wild-type strains, as previously reported (10, 13), with both new IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB mutant constructs also exhibiting a statistically significant decreased motility compared to that of both wild-type strains (P  0.05). "
"5","wild","Transcription of metAB was significantly increased (P  0.05) when FIG 3 Shaking growth curve of the IA3902 wild type (WT), W7 WT, and isogenic mutants reveal that growth is normal (mean  standard error of the mean [SEM]). "
"6","wild","The fold change in expression levels of metAB in the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain increased by 13.31-fold (standard error of the mean [SEM], 2.94) over that of the W7 wild type. "
"7","wild","Additionally, IA3902 wild-type and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB strains had no metAB mRNA transcription detected beyond the threshold cycle (CT) level cutoff 35, which indicated that metAB was not expressed in these strains. "
"8","wild","Thus, both W7 wild-type and IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strains were confirmed to transcribe metAB, while IA3902 and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB strains had no metAB transcription detected. "
"9","wild","The results of the SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated similar protein profiles between wild-type strains and the mutant constructs, confirming that these strains were harvested at a similar growth phase (see Fig. "

"14","wild","As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the W7 ΔluxS strain maintained an ability to colonize chickens similar to W7 wild-type levels at each day postinoculation (dpi) time point, showing no statistical difference (P  0.05). "
"15","wild","In contrast, IA3902 ΔluxS strain colonization abolishment to below the limit of detection was observed at each dpi point and was statistically different (P  0.05) compared to that of the IA3902 wild type. "
"16","wild","The colonization level was significantly (P  0.05) higher than that of the IA3902 ΔluxS parent strain at each dpi point but was still below the level of the IA3902 wild type, indicating that the complementary effect of metAB was partial. "
"17","wild","The observation that colonization patterns of the W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB strain did not match colonization patterns of complete abolishment seen in the IA3902 ΔluxS strain, nor did the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain completely restore cecum colonization levels seen in the W7 ΔluxS and the wild-type strains, suggests that there are additional factors that contribute to colonization differences between these C. jejuni strains. "
"18","wild","DISCUSSION The major conclusions of the current study demonstrate that redundancy of L-met biosynthesis via the presence of metAB in W7 but not IA3902 at least partially explains the differences in colonization ability previously observed between luxS-deficient muFIG 6 Weekly chicken cecal colonization levels by wild-type (WT) strains and isogenic mutants at 5 dpi (week 1), 12 dpi (week 2), and 19 dpi (week 3) (geometric mean  SEM).

"20","wild","Partial recovery of colonization in the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain could also be due to a negative feedback loop of SAM due to an influx of excessive L-met feeding into the AMC, as our mutant was determined to overproduce both AMC products compared to wild-type IA3902 in vitro (Fig. "

"
"61","mutant","This experimental evidence strongly supports the notion that direct L-met utilization or utilization of L-met within the AMC are key contributing factors in the pathobiology of Campylobacter jejuni, as we clearly demonstrated that alteration of MetAB L-met production in luxS-deficient mutants directly alters their chicken colonization ability. "
"62","mutant","Interestingly, W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB mutants lacking metA and metB were still able to colonize chickens, albeit at a lower level. "
"63","mutant","This is consistent with the finding that while L-met levels were decreased in vitro in the W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB mutant, they were not eliminated, nor were they eliminated in the IA3902 ΔluxS strain (Fig. "
"64","mutant","A previous study using the hard-agar plug method has also demonstrated that C. jejuni 81-176 luxS mutants have altered chemotactic response, as the mutant strain migrates toward the amino acids aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, and glutamine (38). "
"65","mutant","Further work using our mutant library to test AMC or AI-2 contributions to these amino acid metabolic disturbances is thus warranted. "
"66","mutant","ΔluxS::metAB and W7 ΔluxS ΔmetAB mutants demonstrated significant metabolic changes to L-met and SAM concentrations using the in vitro TR-FRET assays, which confirmed that genes metAB are directly connected to L-met biosynthesis and downstream SAM production in C. jejuni (Fig. "
"67","mutant","As only partial recovery or disruption of chicken colonization occurred when evaluating our newly generated mutants, this suggested that other factors besides L-met biosynthesis feeding into the AMC may play a role in the observed phenotypes. "
"68","mutant","Thus, partial colonization recovery or disruption indicates that AI-2 utilization may still play a role in altered colonization in luxS mutants. "
"69","mutant","The addition of AI-2 has also been demonstrated to functionally complement phenotypic deficiencies of luxS mutants depending upon the strain utilized (38, 47). "
"70","mutant","Furthermore, additional independent chicken colonization trials have also resulted in C. jejuni luxS-deficient mutants able to partially colonize chickens during early days postinoculation (38). "
"71","mutant","In that study, Quinones et al. reported significantly decreased but not completely eliminated colonization of chickens using C. jejuni 81-176 luxS-deficient mutants after 4 dpi. "
"72","mutant","However, this phenotype is most similar to our IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB mutant, whereby colonization was still present but was significantly decreased compared to the wild type, rather than to the W7 ΔluxS strain, which demonstrates no alteration in colonization ability. "
"73","mutant","This suggests that other genetic differences between strains beyond additional L-met production pathways may also play a role in the ability of luxS mutants to colonize normally, or that AI-2 uptake from the gut microbiome may affect colonization by Campylobacter luxS-deficient mutants. "
"74","mutant","Partial recovery of colonization in the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain could also be due to a negative feedback loop of SAM due to an influx of excessive L-met feeding into the AMC, as our mutant was determined to overproduce both AMC products compared to wild-type IA3902 in vitro (Fig. "
"75","mutant","For example, mutants lacking flagellins or regulators of flagellar biosynthesis, such as FlgR, 54 (rpoN), and 28 (fliA), have defects in chicken colonization (22, 53, 54). "
"76","mutant","The in vitro motility assay demonstrated that IA3902 and W7 luxS mutants have disrupted motility, and recovery or disruption of L-met biosynthesis did not significantly alter motility levels, suggesting that the motility defect is independent of L-met availability (Fig. "
"77","mutant","Investigation of cell shape and flagellar morphology in C. jejuni strain 81116 using transmission electron microscopy comparing wild-type and luxS mutants found no significant differences between the strains (55). "
"78","mutant","Additional work by our lab group in IA3902 and W7 has also demonstrated no differences in flagellar morphology of luxS mutants between strains (24). "
"79","mutant","Previous studies have demonstrated that AI-2 complementation can restore motility defects of C. jejuni luxS mutants, suggesting that alteration in motility may be related to the loss of AI-2 due to luxS mutation instead of loss of L-met synthesis (38, 47). "
"80","mutant","Increased concentrations of S-ribosylhomocysteine, as reported in luxS mutants in C. jejuni (24), has also been demonstrated to significantly increase biofilm formation in Listeria monocytogenes, promoting a sessile state as FIG 7 Inhibitory metabolic products of the activated methyl cycle (AMC). "
"81","mutant","This again indicates other AMC byproducts, such as S-ribosylhomocysteine and AI-2, could be playing a role in colonization alterations in luxS mutants. "
"82","mutant","As our study lacks characterization of a complete AMC metabolic profile of our mutant constructs, it is difficult to make definitive conclusions on potential metabolic disruption or recovery when comparing our mutants. "
"83","mutant","To that end, further investigation using our mutant library in both limiting and standard MH media, followed by more complete metabolomic profiling, could reveal additional contributing metabolic factors and is thus warranted to continue to investigate differences between strains that account for altered colonization ability. "
"84","mutant","During this study, we demonstrated that the availability of additional pathways for L-met biosynthesis conferred by metAB is critical for colonization within the chicken cecum environment in luxS-deficient mutants, and we expanded knowledge on the contribution of the MetAB proteins to the intracellular L-met pool in C. jejuni. "
"85","mutant","It is still unclear what additional metabolic perturbances drive differences in C. jejuni luxS-deficient mutant phenotypic defects; however, the current study strongly supports the role of L-met biosynthesis as a critical component of the AMC important for in vivo colonization. "
"86","mutant","C. jejuni strains and their isogenic mutants were routinely grown using Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth or agar plates (Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 42°C under microaerobic conditions (55% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2) as previously described (13). "
