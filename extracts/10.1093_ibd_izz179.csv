"1","wild","Methods: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis in the Winnie model, we isolated goblet cells from Winnie and wild-type mice and used label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics to understand the functional consequences of Muc2 misfolding and accumulation. "
"2","wild","To achieve this, cell lysates were prepared from GCs isolated from the colon tissue of age-matched Winnie and wild-type mice and analyzed using label-free quantitative proteomics. "
"3","wild","MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Design Proteomics analysis was performed directly and specifically on GCs harvested from mutant and wild-type mice as described later on. "
"4","wild","Colons were then harvested from 20 Winnie (homozygous Muc2 mutant) and 20 wild-type mice (C57BL6/J background) of both sexes (all aged 16 weeks), sliced lengthwise, and washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). "
"5","wild","Bioinformatics Analysis To extract functional information from the proteomics data, the groups of proteins that were significantly up regulated or downregulated in Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs were imported into the online bioinformatics resource DAVID (version 6.8) using the mouse genome as background.16 Functional annotation clusters (FACs) were generated using default parameters and filtered based on P values <0.05 after adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. "
"6","wild","RESULTS Proteomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Protein Exclusively From GCs Isolated From Winnie and Wild-type Colons To profile changes in the proteome of goblet cells isolated from Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs, cell lysates were prepared by sonication in a urea/thiourea lysis buffer, and protein extracts were cleaned up by ethanol precipitation. "
"7","wild","After exclusion of proteins identified on the basis of single matching peptides, a filtered list of 956 proteins that included only proteins detected in all 3 replicates of at least 1 genotype was used to identify proteins that were significantly modulated between wild-type and Winnie GCs. "
"8","wild","A t test analysis of the LFQ expression values identified 426 proteins as differentially abundant between Winnie and wild-type GCs, based on a 1% FDR using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. "
"9","wild","Of the significant proteins, 251 were upregulated and 175 were downregulated in Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs. "
"10","wild","The P values, log2 fold-differences (t test differences), and protein LFQ ratios (Winnie/wild-type) for the significant proteins are provided in Supplemental Table 2 (sheet 4, Columns P, Q, and U, respectively). "
"11","wild","Immunofluorescence staining of Chchd2 in Winnie and wild-type colon tissues (red) with mito-tracker (MT01) counterstaining (green) and nucleus counterstaining with DAPI (blue). "
"12","wild","Accumulation of Muc2 was also evident from the proteomics data, with a 1.9-fold increase in Winnie compared with wild-type GCs (Supplemental Table 2). "
"13","wild","Therefore, we used immunofluorescence to detect nidogen-1 in the colon tissue of Winnie and wild-type mice (Fig. 5), confirming the increased abundance of nidogen-1 identified using proteomics. "

"16","adaptation","However, the observed increase in levels of proteins involved in butanoate (butyrate) metabolism provides evidence for another, more cellspecific prosurvival adaptation of energy homeostasis. "
"17","mutant","MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Design Proteomics analysis was performed directly and specifically on GCs harvested from mutant and wild-type mice as described later on. "

"20","model","The animal model Winnie carries a missense mutation in Muc2 that causes Muc2 misfolding, accumulation in goblet cells, and ER stress. "
"21","model","Methods: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis in the Winnie model, we isolated goblet cells from Winnie and wild-type mice and used label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics to understand the functional consequences of Muc2 misfolding and accumulation. "
"22","model","Conclusions: This study is the first to apply proteome-level analysis to the preclinical Winnie model of ulcerative colitis. "
"23","model","The importance of mucin and ER stress in UC was demonstrated in the Winnie mouse model, where increased ER stress in GCs or mucin deletion leads to spontaneous colitis.3, 4 The Winnie mouse exhibits extensive ER stress within the intestinal GCs due to accumulation of Muc2, leading to both innate and adaptive immune responses, elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17, and culminating in severe intestinal inflammation.3 Similarities of the Winnie mouse model to human UC include histopathology, where severe ulcerations and superficial inflammation are restricted to the distal colon region (unlike the granulomatous small intestinal lesions seen in Crohn’s disease), the goblet cell–specific pathology (ie, reduced mucin secretion and thinner mucous layer), and a cytokine profile dominated by Il-1β and IL-17. "
"24","model","Proteomics has been used to investigate ER stress in cell cultures challenged with pharmacological agents in patient cell lines7, 8 and mouse models of human pathologies, including autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease,9 experimental diabetes,10 skeletal dysplasias,11 and Alzheimer’s disease.12 Collectively, these studies have highlighted that although some common pathways and cellular systems are affected by ER stress, other mechanisms and ultimately cell fate are often context-dependent due to the specialized nature of many cell types. "
"25","model","The goal of the present study was to characterize the ER stress response in the Winnie model to gain a better understanding of the molecular pathology and in particular identify candidate prosurvival proteins. "
"26","model","Although cytoskeletal remodelling is a very plausible consequence of ER stress (eg, to enhance ER-plasma membrane [PM] communication and restore Ca2+ homeostasis29), very little is known about the effects of ER stress on specific cytoskeletal proteins. "
"27","model","DISCUSSION This study applied proteomics to investigate the molecular pathology of a spontaneous mouse model of ulcerative colitis, in which ER stress is a prominent feature. "
"28","model","Although the etiology of UC is largely unknown, the prevalence of ER stress and inflammation in the colon tissue of Winnie mice provides an opportunity for detailed ex vivo analysis of a pathologically relevant ER stress model directly in the specific cell type affected. "
"29","model","The high proportion overall of significantly affected proteins (adjusted P value <0.01) is comparable with other published in vivo models of ER stress. "
"30","model","Indeed, NaB was recently shown to effectively attenuate ER stress–induced apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus by inhibition of the PERK-CHOP pathway.36 Conversely, butyrate exhibits antitumorigenic properties in colorectal cancer cell lines through the induction of apoptosis.37, 38 Clearly, energy availability plays a key role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and cell death, and further work is required to elucidate the role of the butyrate pathway in UC and colorectal cancer. "
"31","model","Similarly, Moriggi et al39 identified cytoskeletal rearrangements in colonic epithelial cells, although this was related to alterations in keratins rather than actin remodeling. "
"32","model","Athough the Winnie model of UC has the advantage over human specimens with respect to biological variation, validation of our findings in human UC will elevate the translational impact of our study. "
