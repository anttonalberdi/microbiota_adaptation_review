"1","wild","Methods: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis in the Winnie model, we isolated goblet cells from Winnie and wild-type mice and used label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics to understand the functional consequences of Muc2 misfolding and accumulation. "
"2","wild","To achieve this, cell lysates were prepared from GCs isolated from the colon tissue of age-matched Winnie and wild-type mice and analyzed using label-free quantitative proteomics. "
"3","wild","MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Design Proteomics analysis was performed directly and specifically on GCs harvested from mutant and wild-type mice as described later on. "
"4","wild","Colons were then harvested from 20 Winnie (homozygous Muc2 mutant) and 20 wild-type mice (C57BL6/J background) of both sexes (all aged 16 weeks), sliced lengthwise, and washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). "
"5","wild","Bioinformatics Analysis To extract functional information from the proteomics data, the groups of proteins that were significantly up regulated or downregulated in Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs were imported into the online bioinformatics resource DAVID (version 6.8) using the mouse genome as background.16 Functional annotation clusters (FACs) were generated using default parameters and filtered based on P values <0.05 after adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. "
"6","wild","RESULTS Proteomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Protein Exclusively From GCs Isolated From Winnie and Wild-type Colons To profile changes in the proteome of goblet cells isolated from Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs, cell lysates were prepared by sonication in a urea/thiourea lysis buffer, and protein extracts were cleaned up by ethanol precipitation. "
"7","wild","After exclusion of proteins identified on the basis of single matching peptides, a filtered list of 956 proteins that included only proteins detected in all 3 replicates of at least 1 genotype was used to identify proteins that were significantly modulated between wild-type and Winnie GCs. "
"8","wild","A t test analysis of the LFQ expression values identified 426 proteins as differentially abundant between Winnie and wild-type GCs, based on a 1% FDR using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing. "
"9","wild","Of the significant proteins, 251 were upregulated and 175 were downregulated in Winnie GCs relative to wild-type GCs. "
"10","wild","The P values, log2 fold-differences (t test differences), and protein LFQ ratios (Winnie/wild-type) for the significant proteins are provided in Supplemental Table 2 (sheet 4, Columns P, Q, and U, respectively). "
"11","wild","Immunofluorescence staining of Chchd2 in Winnie and wild-type colon tissues (red) with mito-tracker (MT01) counterstaining (green) and nucleus counterstaining with DAPI (blue). "
"12","wild","Accumulation of Muc2 was also evident from the proteomics data, with a 1.9-fold increase in Winnie compared with wild-type GCs (Supplemental Table 2). "
"13","wild","Therefore, we used immunofluorescence to detect nidogen-1 in the colon tissue of Winnie and wild-type mice (Fig. 5), confirming the increased abundance of nidogen-1 identified using proteomics. "
"14","wild","Expression of Nidogen-1 in Winnie and wild-type mice colon tissue. "
"15","wild","Immunofluorescence staining of nidogen-1 in Winnie and wild-type colon tissues (red) and nucleus counterstaining with DAPI (blue). "
"16","adaptation","However, the observed increase in levels of proteins involved in butanoate (butyrate) metabolism provides evidence for another, more cellspecific prosurvival adaptation of energy homeostasis. "
