"1","wild","Animals Male wild type [WT] C3H/HeOuJ mice at the age of 5, 6, 9, and 10 weeks were used for the experiments. "
"2","wild","As is already known for other mouse strains,56,57 wild-type GF mice are more susceptible to DSS compared with SPF mice, and die at rather low concentrations of DSS [Supplementary Figure 4A]. "
"3","adaptation","However, very recent studies demonstrate that, in the intestine, a tissue-derived self-renewing macrophage population exists.34,35 Monocytes infiltrating the tissue as well as macrophages possess the remarkable plasticity to differentiate further, following stimulation with either defined cytokines and/or microbial molecules.36 This feature is a prerequisite for the potency of these cells to adapt their phenotype to a specific milieu.37 For example, colitis triggers monocytes to differentiate into pro-inflammatory myeloid cells in the colon.38,39 However, it is unclear whether this adaptation of the macrophage compartment can occur throughout life and whether or not it requires colonization starting from birth. "
"4","adaptation","Nevertheless, the restoration of macrophages required longer than the structural adaptation after microbial colonization. "
"5","adaptation","However, infiltrating monocytes maintain their plasticity and hence can develop this compartment at any time point in life; however, they require several weeks of adaptation. "
"6","model","To analyse the effect of microbiota functionally, DSS-induced colitis was induced, as a barrier-disrupting model [Figure 4D]. "
"7","model","Hence, it is not surprising that neither previous work nor our data detected signs of inflammation in the DSS-exposed GF mice, as indicated by the lack of upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the lack of cell infiltration.56,65 The same result was obtained in an ileitis mouse model using TNFdeltaARE mice.66,67 While it is known that GF mice are more susceptible to DSS, the mechanism behind this has only partially been resolved. "
"8","model","In our previous data, by applying a barrier model system, pro-inflammatory macrophages induced a significant decrease in epithelial resistance, 1182 F. "
"9","model","The finding of mild intestinal inflammation 1 week after colonization suggests a desensitization that mediates the decreased inflammatory response in the DSS-induced colitis model. "
"10","model","Proposed model. "
"11","model","A guide to histomorphological evaluation of intestinal inflammation in mouse models. "
"12","model","A model for dextran sodium sulfate [DSS]-induced mouse colitis: bacterial degradation of DSS does not occur after incubation with mouse cecal contents. "
