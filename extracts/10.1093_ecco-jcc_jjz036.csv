"1","wild","Animals Male wild type [WT] C3H/HeOuJ mice at the age of 5, 6, 9, and 10 weeks were used for the experiments. "
"2","wild","As is already known for other mouse strains,56,57 wild-type GF mice are more susceptible to DSS compared with SPF mice, and die at rather low concentrations of DSS [Supplementary Figure 4A]. "
"3","adaptat","However, very recent studies demonstrate that, in the intestine, a tissue-derived self-renewing macrophage population exists.34,35 Monocytes infiltrating the tissue as well as macrophages possess the remarkable plasticity to differentiate further, following stimulation with either defined cytokines and/or microbial molecules.36 This feature is a prerequisite for the potency of these cells to adapt their phenotype to a specific milieu.37 For example, colitis triggers monocytes to differentiate into pro-inflammatory myeloid cells in the colon.38,39 However, it is unclear whether this adaptation of the macrophage compartment can occur throughout life and whether or not it requires colonization starting from birth. "
"4","adaptat","Nevertheless, the restoration of macrophages required longer than the structural adaptation after microbial colonization. "
"5","adaptat","However, infiltrating monocytes maintain their plasticity and hence can develop this compartment at any time point in life; however, they require several weeks of adaptation. "
"6","model","To analyse the effect of microbiota functionally, DSS-induced colitis was induced, as a barrier-disrupting model [Figure 4D]. "
"7","model","Hence, it is not surprising that neither previous work nor our data detected signs of inflammation in the DSS-exposed GF mice, as indicated by the lack of upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the lack of cell infiltration.56,65 The same result was obtained in an ileitis mouse model using TNFdeltaARE mice.66,67 While it is known that GF mice are more susceptible to DSS, the mechanism behind this has only partially been resolved. "
"8","model","In our previous data, by applying a barrier model system, pro-inflammatory macrophages induced a significant decrease in epithelial resistance, 1182 F. "
"9","model","The finding of mild intestinal inflammation 1 week after colonization suggests a desensitization that mediates the decreased inflammatory response in the DSS-induced colitis model. "

"15","disease","Introduction The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] has been rising over recent decades.1 While it is known that ~25% of IBD cases can be explained genetically,2 this recent increase in incidence cannot be driven by genetic factors, but rather by environmental changes. "
"16","disease","The time point of colonization after birth affects the composition of the natural killer T [NKT] cell compartment, inducing a more proinflammatory state when colonization occurs later in life [at the age of 5 weeks].13 Furthermore, GF mice have previously been characterized by high immunoglobulin E [IgE] levels.14–17 A recent study adds to these data by providing evidence that a distinct level of microbiota diversity following birth forms a prerequisite for inhibition of IgE production.15 Together, these clinical and experimental data fit into the hygiene hypothesis claiming that exposure to bacteria early in life mediates a protection from autoimmune diseases later on.18 Apart from these findings, there is still a need to explore whether the time point of colonization impacts the composition of the intestinal myeloid cells. "
"17","disease","The disease score and histomorphological signs of inflammation were evaluated as described previously.44,45 2.6. "
"18","disease","The histological disease score data and barrier data were tested for statistical significance using a two-sided Mann–WhitneyU-Test. "
"19","disease","Discussion The intestinal homeostasis in the lamina propria is regulated by the intestinal microbiota.3–6 Previous data analysing NKT cell function indicate that a delayed intestinal colonization of GF mice drives the pro-inflammatory capacity of this cell population.13 This relates to the concept of the hygiene hypothesis, in which exposure to antigens early in life has been considered to protect from diseases such as IBD later in life.18 With the present study, we broaden this view by defining the impact of the luminal microbiota on the development and function of intestinal macrophages as well as on mucosal integrity. "
"20","disease","A study by Vos et al. showed that after anti-TNFα treatment, anti-inflammatory macrophages are induced, whereas in untreated Crohn’s disease patients, lamina propria pro-inflammatory macrophages are predominant.26 In line with this, work from our group indicates that the mucosa of patients with Crohn’s disease is densely infiltrated with proinflammatory macrophages, whereas the adjacent mesenteric fat tissue is predominantly infiltrated by rather anti-inflammatory macrophages.25,59 This ability of myeloid cells to adapt to the local milieu suggests that the mucosal macrophage compartment may be able to develop, even when intestinal colonization occurs later in life.

"
"32","environment","The intestinal microbiota composition strongly depends on the environment and is a key factor in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.3–6 Furthermore, the commensal microbiota equally contributes to enterocyte maturation and angiogenesis, and consequently to intestinal barrier function.7,8 Whether the time point of intestinal colonization in life matters for the composition of the intestinal immune cells has so far only partially been addressed. "
"33","environment","That an early exposure to distinct microbiota might play a role in local immune cell maturation is indicated by data about children growing up in a farm environment revealing a decreased risk for developing asthma.9,10 In line, exposure to antibiotics within the first year of life has been linked to an increased risk of developing IBD.11,12 The so-called ‘window of opportunity’, the critical time for microbial contact impacting on the development of the mucosal immune system was previously studied with germ-free [GF] mice.
