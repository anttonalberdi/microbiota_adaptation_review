"1","wild","Animals Male wild type [WT] C3H/HeOuJ mice at the age of 5, 6, 9, and 10 weeks were used for the experiments. "
"2","wild","As is already known for other mouse strains,56,57 wild-type GF mice are more susceptible to DSS compared with SPF mice, and die at rather low concentrations of DSS [Supplementary Figure 4A]. "
"3","adaptation","However, very recent studies demonstrate that, in the intestine, a tissue-derived self-renewing macrophage population exists.34,35 Monocytes infiltrating the tissue as well as macrophages possess the remarkable plasticity to differentiate further, following stimulation with either defined cytokines and/or microbial molecules.36 This feature is a prerequisite for the potency of these cells to adapt their phenotype to a specific milieu.37 For example, colitis triggers monocytes to differentiate into pro-inflammatory myeloid cells in the colon.38,39 However, it is unclear whether this adaptation of the macrophage compartment can occur throughout life and whether or not it requires colonization starting fromÂ birth. "
"4","adaptation","Nevertheless, the restoration of macrophages required longer than the structural adaptation after microbial colonization. "
"5","adaptation","However, infiltrating monocytes maintain their plasticity and hence can develop this compartment at any time point in life; however, they require several weeks of adaptation. "
