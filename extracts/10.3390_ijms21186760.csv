"1","wild","Morphological Effects of SDP in Mdr1a KO Mice Colon of Mdr1a knockout (KO) mice were shorter and thicker than those of wild-type (WT) animals (p < 0.001; Figure 1A–C). "
"2","wild","Animals and Experimental Design Mdr1a knockout mice (FVB.129P2-Abcb1atm 1BorN7; KO mice) and the corresponding FVB wild type (WT mice) were purchased from Taconics (Germtown, NY, USA). "
"3","model","The aim of this study was to analyze if SDP supplementation could ameliorate colitis in a genetic mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). "
"4","model","In conclusion, dietary supplementation with SDP enhances colon barrier function and reduces mucosal inflammation in a mouse model of IBD. "
"5","model","Using the Mdr1a knockout (KO) mouse model of colitis [10,11], we previously showed that serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins (SBI) reduce colon permeability and the expression of oxidative markers and proinflammatory cytokines in the colonic mucosa, as well as leukocyte infiltration in the lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes [12,13]. "
"6","model","Moreover, SBIs improve mucositis symptoms, tissue damage scores, and neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages in a rat model of mucositis [14]. "
"7","model","Given the ability of SBI effects reducing the severity of colitis in the Mdr1a KO mouse model [12,13], we wanted to study if SDP, a compound with well-documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, can also modulate the immune response and ameliorate colitis in this animal model. "
"8","model","Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation with SDP on the evolution of IBD in a mouse model of spontaneous colitis. "
"9","model","This effect is similar to that observed in the same model of colitis after supplementation with SBI, which is an immunoglobulin concentrate [12]. "
"10","model","This effect is notable because these chemokines are important mediators for the recruitment and accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in colitis models [36]. "
"11","model","Along this line, similar effects of SDP supplementation have been observed in other rodent models of jejunum and pulmonary acute inflammation [40–42]. "
"12","model","A similar response pattern has been observed in the Staphylococcal enterotoxin B model of mild intestinal inflammation [19] and in acute lung inflammation induced by LPS [45]. "
"13","model","The lack of a TGF-β response was unexpected because, in other inflammation models, such as intestinal and genitourinary acute inflammation models, SDP induces the secretion of TGF-β [41,53]. "
"14","model","In a very different condition, such as in a mouse model of senescence, SDP increases the brain concentration of IL-10, suggesting its participation in the regulation of immune responses in nonmucosal tissues [20]. "
"15","model","In fact, different species of the genus Lactobacillus have been shown to be effective in promoting the expression of Il-10 [22] or in reducing the expression of adhesion molecules that promote leukocyte recruitment in an experimental colitis model [56]. "
"16","model","The beneficial effect of SDP in this model suggests a role for plasma-derived supplements in preventing and ameliorating IBD. "
"17","model","Dietary intervention with serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins protects barrier function in a mouse model of colitis. "
"18","model","Effect of dietary probiotics on colon length in an inflammatory bowel disease-induced murine model: A meta-analysis. "
"19","model","The anti-inflammatory effect of spray-dried plasma is mediated by a reduction in mucosal lymphocyte activation and infiltration in a mouse model of intestinal inflammation. "
"20","model","Dietary plasma proteins attenuate the innate immunity response in a mouse model of acute lung injury. "
"21","knockout","Wild-type mice and Mdr1a knockout (KO) mice were administered a control diet or an SDP-supplemented diet from day 21 (weaning) until day 56. "
"22","knockout","Using the Mdr1a knockout (KO) mouse model of colitis [10,11], we previously showed that serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins (SBI) reduce colon permeability and the expression of oxidative markers and proinflammatory cytokines in the colonic mucosa, as well as leukocyte infiltration in the lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes [12,13].
