"1","wild","Expression of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), detected with in situ mRNA labeling, was higher in animals infected with wild-type S. flexneri versus mutant strains deficient in icsA or T3SS, suggesting that epithelial invasion promotes expression of this chemokine. "
"2","wild","Additionally, none of the mutants induced colonic edema or epithelial cell sloughing, pathological features that characterized wild-type (WT) infection (Fig. 2; see Fig. "
"3","wild","The Smr strain was used as the wild-type (WT) strain for all subsequent experiments, including animal experiments and construction of mutant strains. "
"4","wild","The streptomycin resistance allele was transferred from the Smr wild-type strain into strain BS103 by P1 transduction, yielding a Smr plasmidless strain. "
"5","wild","Mutations generated by lambda red were moved into a clean genetic background by transferring the mutation to the Smr wild-type strain via P1 transduction. "
"6","wild","Infant rabbits were administered a subcutaneous injection of Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride; 50 mg/kg of body weight; GlaxoSmithKline) 3 h prior to inoculation with the wild type (Smr) or isogenic mutants. "
"7","wild","Immunofluorescence images were analyzed from 20 wild-type rabbits and at least 4 rabbits infected with each of the various mutant bacterial strains, or uninfected rabbits; 2 or 3 colon sections per rabbit were examined. "
"8","fitness","ARTIST: high-resolution genome-wide assessment of fitness using transposon-insertion sequencing. "
