"1","wild","Expression of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), detected with in situ mRNA labeling, was higher in animals infected with wild-type S. flexneri versus mutant strains deficient in icsA or T3SS, suggesting that epithelial invasion promotes expression of this chemokine. "

"3","wild","The Smr strain was used as the wild-type (WT) strain for all subsequent experiments, including animal experiments and construction of mutant strains. "
"4","wild","The streptomycin resistance allele was transferred from the Smr wild-type strain into strain BS103 by P1 transduction, yielding a Smr plasmidless strain. "
"5","wild","Mutations generated by lambda red were moved into a clean genetic background by transferring the mutation to the Smr wild-type strain via P1 transduction. "
"6","wild","Infant rabbits were administered a subcutaneous injection of Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride; 50 mg/kg of body weight; GlaxoSmithKline) 3 h prior to inoculation with the wild type (Smr) or isogenic mutants. "
"7","wild","Immunofluorescence images were analyzed from 20 wild-type rabbits and at least 4 rabbits infected with each of the various mutant bacterial strains, or uninfected rabbits; 2 or 3 colon sections per rabbit were examined. "

"
"10","mutant","(A) Clinical signs in infant rabbits infected with S. flexneri or isogenic mutant strains. "
"11","mutant","Initially, a high-density transposon mutant library in S. flexneri was created using a mariner-based transposon that inserts at TA dinucleotide sites in the genome. "
"12","mutant","Infant rabbits were inoculated with the transposon library, and transposon mutants that persisted after 36 hpi were recovered from the colon. "
"13","mutant","12 8. poson mutants that were present in the input library. "
"14","mutant","These random losses of mutants confound interpretation of these experiments and preclude accurate identification of genes subject to in vivo selection. "
"15","mutant","We also tested isogenic mutants that lack one of two key virulence factors: IcsA (ΔicsA strain), which is required for intracellular actin-based motility and cell-to-cell spreading, and MxiM (ΔmxiM strain), which is a T3SS structural component (57). mxiM deletion mutants do not assemble a functional T3SS, do not secrete T3SS effectors, and do not invade tissue-cultured epithelial cells (57–59). "
"16","mutant","Like the plasmidless strain, the ΔicsA and ΔmxiM strains did not cause disease; none of the rabbits infected with either of these two mutant strains developed diarrhea, succumbed to infection, or had a reduction in body temperature (Fig. "
"17","mutant","Additionally, none of the mutants induced colonic edema or epithelial cell sloughing, pathological features that characterized wild-type (WT) infection (Fig. 2; see Fig. "
"18","mutant","All three of the mutant strains had reduced capacities to colonize the infant rabbit intestine (Fig. "
"19","mutant","Notably, the reduction in the colonization of the icsA mutant was at least as great as the other two mutant strains, suggesting that cell-to-cell spreading or the adhesin function of IcsA is critical for intestinal colonization. "
"20","mutant","Interestingly, the icsA mutant led to an accumulation of heterophils (innate immune cells that are the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils) in the colon that was not observed in animals infected with the WT strain (Fig. "
"21","mutant","The mxiM mutant also recruited more heterophils to the lamina propria and epithelial cell layer than the WT strain (Fig. "
"22","mutant","Since colonic pathology was altered in the mutant strains, we investigated the intestinal localization and IL-8 production induced by the mutants. "
"23","mutant","All three of the mutant strains were found almost exclusively in the lumen of the colon (Fig. "
"24","mutant","S4); in contrast to the WT strain (Fig. 3), it was difficult to detect infection foci in the epithelial cell layer in animals infected with mutant strains (Fig. "
"25","mutant","The icsA mutant was occasionally observed inside epithelial cells (Fig. "
"26","mutant","As expected, we observed very few cells expressing IL-8 mRNA in the colons of rabbits infected with any of the three mutant S. flexneri strains (Fig. "
"27","mutant","Despite the reduced intestinal colonization of the icsA and mxiM mutants, these strains elicited more pronounced colonic inflammation (characterized by infiltration of heterophils) than the WT strain did. "

"
"33","mutant","It seems unlikely the ΔicsA mutant’s colonization defect is entirely attributable to the mutant’s deficiency in cell-to-cell spreading. "
"34","mutant","Since distinct regions of IcsA are required for its adhesive versus cell spreading activities (67), it may be possible to genetically dissect which of these IcsA functions plays a dominant role in colonization, using S. flexneri strains producing mutant versions of IcsA. "
"35","mutant","For example, the diversity of the inoculum could be reduced by generating a defined library of transposon mutants with only one or two mutants per gene (e.g., as has been done in Edwardsiella piscicida [69]). "
"36","mutant","An additional difference is that intrarectal instillation of a ΔicsA mutant led to induction of cytokine expression, heterophil recruitment, and only slightly reduced colonization of the strain, whereas following oral inoculation, a ΔicsA S. flexneri exhibited a marked colonization defect and did not induce IL-8 mRNA Oral Inoculation Model of Shigellosis ® January/February 2020 Volume 11 Issue 1 e03105-19 mbio.asm.org 13 D ow nl oa de d fr om h ttp s: //j ou rn al s. as m .o rg /jo ur na l/m bi o on 1 1 Ja nu ar y 20 22 b y 5.

"37","mutant","The Smr strain was used as the wild-type (WT) strain for all subsequent experiments, including animal experiments and construction of mutant strains. "
"38","mutant","Single gene deletion mutants were generated in the WT Smr strain using the lambda red recombination method, as previously described (75). "
"39","mutant","Retention of the virulence plasmid throughout P1 transduction of the mutation into the parental WT Smr strain was monitored by plating bacterial mutants on LB plus Congo red to identify red colonies and by performing multiplex PCR for various genes spread across the virulence plasmid (primers are listed in Table S2).

"47","model","Small animal models of shigellosis that rely on the oral route of infection are lacking. "
"48","model","Diarrhea, intestinal colonization, and pathology in this model were dependent on the S. flexneri type III secretion system and IcsA, canonical Shigella virulence factors. "

"52","model","Among animals used to model infection, only nonhuman primates develop shigellosis from oral inoculation (18); however, the expense of this model limits its utility. "
"53","model","Several small animal models of Shigella infection have been developed, yet none capture all the features of natural human infection. "
"54","model","Historically, the Sereny test was used to identify Shigella virulence factors required for induction of an inflammatory response (19); however, this ocular model bears little resemblance to natural infection. "
"55","model","The adult rabbit ligated ileal loop model has proven useful for the study of Shigella virulence factors (20). "
"56","model","However, this model bypasses the normal route of infection and challenges the small intestine, which is not the primary site of pathology in human infections. "
"57","model","Adult mice, the most genetically tractable mammalian model organism, are recalcitrant to developing disease when inoculated orally (25). "
"58","model","As an alternative to oral inoculation, an adult mouse pulmonary model of Shigella infection involving intranasal inoculation of mice with Shigella has been developed (26); this model provides a platform to investigate host immune responses and vaccine candidates (27, 28), and this model has improved understanding of the innate immune response to Shigella infection (29). "
"59","model","A zebrafish larva model, in which the Shigella T3SS is required for pathogen virulence, has been useful for characterizing cell-mediated innate immune responses to Shigella due to the ability to image infection in vivo (32, 33). "
"60","model","Recently, an infant rabbit intrarectal inoculation model in which animals develop disease and rectal pathology reminiscent of natural infections was described (10). "
"61","model","The lack of a robust, oral inoculation-based, small animal model of shigellosis has limited understanding of the role of virulence factors in pathogenesis, particularly of the importance of such factors for enabling intestinal colonization and for generating pathology and clinical signs. "
"62","model","Thus, our findings suggest that the orogastric infant rabbit model provides a powerful and accessible small animal model for further investigation of factors contributing to Shigella pathogenesis and for testing new therapeutics. "
"63","model","Here, we explored the suitability of orogastric inoculation of infant rabbits to model Shigella infection. "
"64","model","IL-8, a proinflammatory CXC [chemokine (C-X-C motif)] family chemokine that recruits neutrophils (47), has been shown to be elevated during Shigella infection in animal models (10, 21, 48) and in humans (49, 50). "

"68","model","12 8. oral infection of infant rabbits offers a useful experimental model for investigations of the pathogenesis of shigellosis. "

"
"71","model","In the oral infant rabbit model, the WT strain caused edema and sloughing of epithelial cells in the colon, but we did not observe recruitment of heterophils, suggesting that colonic pathology is not primarily attributable to an acute inflammatory response characterized by heterophil infiltration. "
"72","model","The intrarectal infant rabbit model of shigellosis reported by Yum et al. (10) has some beneficial features compared to the oral infection model. "
"73","model","Additional studies are required to elucidate the reasons that account for the differential importance of IcsA in these models. "
"74","model","While some features of the intrarectal model are attractive, Yum et al. used 2-week-old rabbits that were carefully hand reared in an animal facility from birth using a complex protocol that may prove difficult for others to adopt (10). "
"75","model","In addition to the physiologic route of infection, the oral infant rabbit model requires far less specialized animal husbandry than the intrarectal model and may therefore prove more accessible. "
"76","model","In summary, oral inoculation of infant rabbits with Shigella provides a feasible small animal model to study the pathogenesis of this globally important enteric pathogen. "
