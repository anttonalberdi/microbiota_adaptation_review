"1","wild","Samples from the aquaculture centre displayed a higher diversity than the wild catch Nile tilapia from Lake Tana even though there is also an overlapping of the detected microbial groups. "
"2","wild","However, there is insufficient understanding regarding the effects of sampling season and catching site (wild and aquaculture) on the gut microbiota of Nile tilapia. "
"3","wild","Significant differences were observed in microbial diversity across sampling months and between wild and captive Nile tilapia. "
"4","wild","The alpha diversity clearly showed that samples from the aquaculture Biology 2021, 10, 180. https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10030180 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biology Biology 2021, 10, 180 2 of 18 centre (captive) had a higher diversity than the wild Nile tilapia samples from Lake Tana. "
"5","wild","This study clearly showed the impact of sampling season and catching site (wild and aquaculture) on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities associated with the gut of Nile tilapia. "
"6","wild","In addition, differences between the gut microbiota composition of wild fish from Lake Tana and farm fish from aquaculture facility centre were investigated. "
"7","wild","In addition, differences between the gut microbiota composition of wild fish from Lake Tana and farm fish from aquaculture f cility centre were i vestigated. "
"8","wild","For comparison of the wild population with the aquaculture samples, only samples collected in August from Lake Tana were used. "
"9","wild","Comparison of Gut Microbiota between Wild and Captive Fish To assess the gut microbiota differences between wild and aquaculture Nile tilapia samples, samples of Lake Tana were compared with Bahir Dar aquaculture facility centre samples. "
"10","wild","Biology 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 19 The alpha diversity (observed p-value: 0.00043447, Shannon p-value: 3.96×10-05 and Simpson index p-value: 3.96×10-05) clearly showed that samples from the aquaculture facility centre had higher diversity than the wild Nile tilapia samples from Lake Tana (Supplementary Figure S6a–c). "

"12","wild","The alpha diversity (observed p-value: 0.00043447, Shannon p-value: 3.96×10-05 and Simpson index p-value: 3.96×10-05) clearly showed that samples from the aquaculture facility centre had higher diversity than the wild Nile tilapia samples from Lake Tana (Supplementary Figure S6a–c). "
"13","wild","According to Delport et al. [76], in the gut of Australian sea lion, Proteobacteria contributed more to captive than to wild Australian sea lion populations. "
"14","wild","The alpha diversity clearly showed that the samples from the aquaculture facility centre had a higher diversity than the wild Nile tilapia samples from Lake Tana (Supplementary Figure S6a–c). "
"15","wild","In contrast to our findings, the gut of wild Atlantic Salmon parr [20], Killifish Fundulus heteroclitus [21], flatfish Paralichthys adspersus [22] and Malaysian Mahseer Tor tambroides [78] had a higher microbial diversity than the farm specimens. "
"16","wild","In accordance with this, substantial differences in intestinal microbial community composition and diversity were observed between wild and farm Salmon [80]. "
"17","wild","In our study, the diversity and composition of bacteria associated with the gut of Nile tilapia varied between sampling months and habitat types (wild and aquaculture centre). "
"18","wild","Characterization of the intestinal microbiota of wild caught and farmed fine flounder (Paralichthys adspersus). "
"19","wild","Comparative study of gut microbiota in wild and captive Malaysian Mahseer (Tor tambroides). "
"20","fitness","Thus it is important to evaluate their importance for Nile Tilapia fitness. "
