"1","wild","BCAP2/2 mice had more bone marrow (BM) monocytes than wild-type (WT) mice, and in mixed WT:BCAP2/2 BM chimeras, monocytes and neutrophils skewed toward BCAP2/2 origin, showing a competitive advantage for BCAP2/2 myeloid cells. "
"2","wild","We therefore examined the numbers of neutrophils and monocytes of wild-type (WT) and BCAP2/2 mice in the steady state. "
"3","model","1508 DUGGAN et al BLOOD, 16 MARCH 2017 x VOLUME 129, NUMBER 11 D ow nloaded from http://ashpublications.org/blood/article-pdf/129/11/1503/1399182/blood719823.pdf by guest on 21 January 2022 supporting a model in which BCAP restrains myeloid differentiation via suppression of progenitor proliferation in a cell-intrinsic manner. "
"4","model","To determine if BCAP controls monocyte and neutrophil production during demand situations, we used several in vivo models. "
"5","model","Furthermore, in the Ccr2-depleter model, although only inflammatory monocytes were specifically depleted, both monocyte and neutrophil numbers were increased in BCAP2/2 mice, which shows that the effect of BCAP is on an oligopotent progenitor, not a committed monocyte progenitor, in this model. "
"6","model","That BCAP can inhibit demand-adapted myelopoiesis in these diversemodels suggests that BCAP regulates a critical early step in these processes. "
"7","environment","Cyclophosphamide creates a receptive microenvironment for prostate cancer skeletal metastasis. "
