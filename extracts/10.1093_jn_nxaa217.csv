"12","model","Comparisons of the 2 mouse models revealed that WTderived fecal microbiota also stood out from that of LRKO by an enrichment in Akkermansia, Adlercreutzia, Dubosiella, Turicibacter, Streptococcus, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and depletion of Faecalibaculum, Tyzzerella, Oscillibacter, Anaerotruncus, Intestinimonas, GCA_900066575, Ruminiclostridium_9, Peptococcaceae_g, Roseburia, Enterorhabdus, Acetatifactor, and Lachnospiraceae_g (Supplemental Figure 4).

"13","model","However, regardless of the differences in the genera profile inherent to the genetic background of each mouse model, fermented dairy protein products were found to consistently modulate the relative abundance of some bacteria. "
"14","model","As expected, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which was used to ferment the YP preparation, was exclusively enhanced in YP-fed mice feces in both WT and LRKO models (Supplemental Figure 6B). "
"15","model","This effect of YP on insulinemia did not affect the HOMA-IR index but resulted in a higher Matsuda IS index compared with the nonfermented MP diet (Figure 4E, F), further indicating that feeding YP improved insulin sensitivity in this genetic model of dyslipidemia. "
"16","model","Taking advantage of mouse models of diet-induced obesity and CVD, we found that replacing 50% of nondairy protein with dairy protein, and especially with fermented dairy protein/peptides, promotes cardiometabolic benefits potentially through their impact on the gut microbiota. "
"17","model","The effects of fermented dairy products were associated with improved insulin sensitivity and reduced NAFLD in the more severe LRKO mouse model, as compared to nonfermented dairy product (MP) consumption. "
"18","model","In vivo screening of multiple bacterial strains identifies Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lb102 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bf141 as probiotics that improve metabolic disorders in a mouse model of obesity. "
"19","model","Yoghurt consumption regulates the immune cells implicated in acute intestinal inflammation and prevents the recurrence of the inflammatory process in a mouse model. "
