"1","wild","One cause may be a reliance on captive animals, which can have very different gut microbiomes compared to their wild counterparts. "
"2","wild","To resolve this disagreement, we analyze a new, large, and highly diverse animal distal gut 16 S rRNA microbiome dataset, which comprises 80% wild animals and includes members of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and Actinopterygii. "
"3","wild","Second, due to the challenge of sample collection and metadata gathering from wild animals, many studies have utilized captive animals. "
"4","wild","However, the gut microbiome of wild and captive animals can differ substantially6,22,23, which has led to calls for more studies that assess the microbiomes of wild animals9,24. "
"5","wild","To address this challenge, we generate and analyze a very large and highly diverse vertebrate distal gut microbiome 16S rRNA dataset, comprising 80% wild animals that include members of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and Actinopterygii (which diverged from a last common ancestor ~435 MYA). "
"6","wild","Sampling was mostly restricted to animals living in the wild, with some additional samples originating from domesticated livestock and pets (Supplementary Data 1). "
"7","wild","To ensure sample origin, samples were gathered by specialized wildlife biologists doing research on the host species in the field. "
"8","wild","Fusobacteria abundance ranged from 6% to 35% among the Crocodylus species, which is reflective of high Fusobacteria abundance previously b c 150 100 50 0 150 N o. of sam ples N o. of species N o. of sam ples N o. of species V al ue 100 50 0 150 100 50 0 150V al ue 100 50 0 Ac tin op te ry gii Am ph ibi a Av es M am m ali a Host class Captive/wild Captive Human Wild Diet Carnivore Herbivore Omnivore Re pt ilia Ac tin op te ry gii Am ph ibi a Av es M am m ali a Host class Re pt ilia Diet a Herbivore Omnivore Carnivore 0 1 3 5 7 0.25 Anthropogenic Aquatic Terrestrial Terrestrial (cultivated) Captive Human Wild Feces Gut Bacteroidetes CKC4 Firmicutes Fusobacteria Proteobacteria Spirochaetae Tenericutes Verrucomicrobia Other 0.5 1 1: Leaves, branches, bark, buds 2: Grass, water plants 3: Roots, tubers 4: Seeds 5: Fruit 6: Nectar, pollen 7: Vertebrate 8: Invertebrate Diet (detailed) Habitat Captive-wild Sample type Phylum Tree scale: 100MYA NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10191-3 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:2200 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10191-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3 observed in alligators29. "
"9","wild","Given the potential for observing novel cultured and uncultured microbes among the phylogenetically diverse and mostly wild hosts, we assessed how many OTUs in the dataset were closely related to cultured and uncultured representatives in the SILVA database. "
"10","wild","Importantly, the “Technical” covariate, which comprised sample type (feces versus gut contents) and captivity status (wild versus captive) also lacked significance for all models, suggesting no substantial effect of technical variation in our dataset. "
"11","wild","We found that these results did not substantially change when only including wild animal samples (total samples= 170; total host species= 119) (Supplementary Fig. 10), suggesting that the minor number of captive animals in this study did not substantially contribute to the observed patterns. "
"12","wild","From inner to outer, the data mapped onto the tree is host diet (general), host diet (detailed breakdown), host habitat, host captive/wild status, the microbiome sample type, and the relative abundances of microbial phyla in each host. "
"13","wild","For example, the Giraffa camelopardalis samples are from two captive and two wild individuals, so the dietary information somewhat differs, resulting in intermediate values (orange). b, c show the number of samples or host species per class colored by captive/wild status or diet, respectively. "
"14","wild","Discussion While various studies have shown that host diet and phylogeny modulate the animal intestinal microbiome5,6, we have expanded on this previous work by performing a robust assessment of each factor’s effect on a homogeneously generated dataset of highly diverse and predominantly wild animals. "
"15","wild","So, as with other calls for more studies of wild animal microbiomes9,24, our findings also advocate for more research utilizing both culture-dependent and -independent methods to characterize the physiology, ecology, and evolution of vertebrate gut-inhabiting microbes. "
"16","wild","In conclusion, our findings help to resolve the major modulators of intestinal microbiome diversity in animals, which have not been well studied in wild animals, especially non-mammalian species. "
"17","wild","Only fresh samples with confirmed origin from a known host species were collected, most of them by wildlife biologists conducting long-term research on the respective species in its habitat. "
"18","wild","We calculated the Gower distance for the detailed diet data, detailed habitat data, and sample type data (wild/ captive animal+ gut/feces sample origin; see Fig. "
