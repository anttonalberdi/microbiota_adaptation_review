"1","wild","One cause may be a reliance on captive animals, which can have very different gut microbiomes compared to their wild counterparts. "
"2","wild","To resolve this disagreement, we analyze a new, large, and highly diverse animal distal gut 16 S rRNA microbiome dataset, which comprises 80% wild animals and includes members of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and Actinopterygii. "
"3","wild","Second, due to the challenge of sample collection and metadata gathering from wild animals, many studies have utilized captive animals. "
"4","wild","However, the gut microbiome of wild and captive animals can differ substantially6,22,23, which has led to calls for more studies that assess the microbiomes of wild animals9,24. "
"5","wild","To address this challenge, we generate and analyze a very large and highly diverse vertebrate distal gut microbiome 16S rRNA dataset, comprising 80% wild animals that include members of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and Actinopterygii (which diverged from a last common ancestor ~435 MYA). "
"6","wild","Sampling was mostly restricted to animals living in the wild, with some additional samples originating from domesticated livestock and pets (Supplementary Data 1). "
"7","wild","To ensure sample origin, samples were gathered by specialized wildlife biologists doing research on the host species in the field. "

"
"9","wild","Given the potential for observing novel cultured and uncultured microbes among the phylogenetically diverse and mostly wild hosts, we assessed how many OTUs in the dataset were closely related to cultured and uncultured representatives in the SILVA database. "
"10","wild","Importantly, the “Technical” covariate, which comprised sample type (feces versus gut contents) and captivity status (wild versus captive) also lacked significance for all models, suggesting no substantial effect of technical variation in our dataset. "
"11","wild","We found that these results did not substantially change when only including wild animal samples (total samples= 170; total host species= 119) (Supplementary Fig. 10), suggesting that the minor number of captive animals in this study did not substantially contribute to the observed patterns. "
"12","wild","From inner to outer, the data mapped onto the tree is host diet (general), host diet (detailed breakdown), host habitat, host captive/wild status, the microbiome sample type, and the relative abundances of microbial phyla in each host. "
"13","wild","For example, the Giraffa camelopardalis samples are from two captive and two wild individuals, so the dietary information somewhat differs, resulting in intermediate values (orange). b, c show the number of samples or host species per class colored by captive/wild status or diet, respectively. "
"14","wild","Discussion While various studies have shown that host diet and phylogeny modulate the animal intestinal microbiome5,6, we have expanded on this previous work by performing a robust assessment of each factor’s effect on a homogeneously generated dataset of highly diverse and predominantly wild animals. "
"15","wild","So, as with other calls for more studies of wild animal microbiomes9,24, our findings also advocate for more research utilizing both culture-dependent and -independent methods to characterize the physiology, ecology, and evolution of vertebrate gut-inhabiting microbes. "
"16","wild","In conclusion, our findings help to resolve the major modulators of intestinal microbiome diversity in animals, which have not been well studied in wild animals, especially non-mammalian species. "
"17","wild","Only fresh samples with confirmed origin from a known host species were collected, most of them by wildlife biologists conducting long-term research on the respective species in its habitat. "

"29","model","Each of our four MRM models (one per diversity metric) had a significant overall fit (p < 0.005 for all MRM models). "
"30","model","Importantly, the “Technical” covariate, which comprised sample type (feces versus gut contents) and captivity status (wild versus captive) also lacked significance for all models, suggesting no substantial effect of technical variation in our dataset. "
"31","model","See “Methods” for a description of how each distance matrix for the MRM models was generated. "
"32","model","While a positive correlation can be the result of other processes besides co-cladogenesis36, the pattern is consistent with a model of host–symbiont coevolution. "
"33","model","Altogether, these data support a model of host–microbe coevolution, with Mammalia displaying the strongest cophylogeny signal. "
"34","model","These tests assess the degree of phylogenetic clustering within each sample (host) relative to a permuted null model. "
"35","model","Specifically, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis to determine which OTUs significantly positively or negatively cooccurred relative to a permuted null model. "
"36","model","The animal species possessing microbial communities that were phylogenetically evenly distributed were the long-eared owl (Asio otus), fallow deer (Dama dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), cattle (Bos taurus), and sheep (Ovis aries). b The bar charts depict the fraction of host species for each host class/diet where microbial taxa are more phylogenetically clustered (clustered) or evenly distributed (even) than expected from the null model or those that did not deviate from the null model (NA). "
"37","model","For PACo, we used the quasiswap null model, which does not assume that the symbiont is tracking the evolution of the host or vice versa (a conservative approach). "
"38","model","PGLS models were conducted with caper74 R package. "
"39","model","A Brownian motion model of evolution was used. "
"40","environment","Finally, we find that environmental filtering and microbe-microbe interactions differ among host clades. "
"41","environment","Concretely understanding how environmental perturbations, host–microbe coevolution, and other factors dictate the microbial diversity in the animal intestine holds importance for the conservation and management of animal populations along with determining their adaptive potential to environmental change4. "
"42","environment","However, we are still far from this understanding, especially regarding nonmammalian species and non-captive species in their natural environment. "
"43","environment","Finally, we utilize eco-phylogenetic methods and co-occurrence analyses to investigate the effects of environmental filtering and microbe–microbe interactions on microbial community assembly in the vertebrate intestine. "
"44","environment","The stronger signal of cophylogeny among mammals may be the result of more transient environmental microbes in the guts of nonmammals. "
"45","environment","Moreover, the non-mammal associated taxa had a significantly higher specificity for environmental EMP biomes (Wilcox, p < 0.006); Supplementary Fig. "

"
"47","environment","The only mammal-specific genus to show a strong environmental association was Paludibacter (Bacteroidetes phylum). "
"48","environment","Our findings that diet and host evolutionary history significantly explain microbiome diversity indicate that environmental filtering plays a substantial role in microbial community assembly. "
"49","environment","In order to further test this notion and to assess how environmental filtering may differ among host clades, we utilized two ecophylogenetics analyses: mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD). "
"50","environment","These findings suggest that community assembly differs between Artiodactyla and non-Artiodactyla mammals, with microbe–microbe competition and/or facilitation surpassing gut environmental filtering among Artiodactyla species. "
"51","environment","Many members of Clostridiales generate resistant spores, which may allow for high inter-species or environment–host migration. "
"52","environment","This process could generate source–sink dynamics, where Clostridiales pass through specific gut environments only transiently, but their high migration rates from source hosts, soil, water, etc. continually replenish these ephemeral sink populations. "
"53","environment","First, all Clostridiales genera specific to mammals or non-mammals in our dataset were specific to animal/human samples and not environmental samples in the EMP dataset (Supplementary Fig. "
"54","environment","Taken together, these results are consistent with a scenario in which diet mediates community assembly through environmental filtering predominantly at the level of functional guilds (e.g., cellulolytic consortia), while host evolutionary history mainly dictates the prevalence of specific OTUs (i.e., heritable microbial taxa). "
"55","environment","First, the gut microbiomes of non-mammal species may contain more transient microbes from environmental sources. "
"56","environment","This may be especially true of the Actinopterygii, given that the surrounding environment is thought to be one of the primary mechanisms of microbiota acquisition for fish52. "
"57","environment","Still, mixed-mode transmission (vertical transmission and transmission from unrelated hosts or the environment) is considered to be more prevalent among non-mammals56. "
"58","environment","In accordance with this hypothesis, we observed a significantly higher signal of environmental biome specificity among microbial genera more associated with non-mammals versus mammals (Supplementary Fig. "
"59","environment","The majority of microbial communities showed significant phylogenetic clustering (Fig. 6), which supports our hypothesis that diet and host phylogeny impose environmental filtering on specific functional guilds and/or certain taxa. "
"60","environment","This is consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of environmental filtering are limited among Artiodactyla. "
"61","environment","Samples associated with human, animal, or non-anthropogenic environmental biomes were selected (n= 1217) and grouped into general biome categories (e.g., “soil” or “sediment”) based on EMP metadata (e.g., “env_feature”; Supplementary Data 3). "
"62","human","For instance, diet can rapidly and reproducibly alter the microbiome in humans and mice10,11. "
"63","human","Still, each individual seems to possess a unique microbiome, and studies on humans and animals have identified microbes whose abundances are determined by host genetics (i.e., heritable microbes)12,13. "
"64","human","Other OTU clades with significant phylogenetic signal included the genera Christensenella, Blautia, and Methanobrevibacter, which were all found to be consistently heritable among multiple human cohort studies12,35. "

"
"66","human","Genera did not contribute equally to this signal, and actually many non-mammal and mammal specific genera were only specific to human and/or animal biomes in the EMP dataset. "
"67","human","Interestingly, Methanobrevibacter OTUs were only found in sub-network 1 and significantly co-occurred with Christensenellaceae OTUs as previously seen in a large human cohort study35. "
"68","human","First, all Clostridiales genera specific to mammals or non-mammals in our dataset were specific to animal/human samples and not environmental samples in the EMP dataset (Supplementary Fig. "
"69","human","New culturomics techniques are greatly reducing the number of uncultured microbes in the human gut46; however, our analysis suggests that microbes from other animals are far less represented (Supplementary Fig. "
"70","human","Our findings correspond with studies of microbial heritability in humans, in which the abundances of only certain specific taxonomic groups have been consistently found to be dictated by host genetics across multiple independent studies12. "
"71","human","Moreover, we observed significant phylogenetic signal for OTUs belonging to all three clades identified by Goodrich and colleagues12 to be consistently heritable in humans: Methanobrevibacter, Christensenellaceae, and Blautia. "
"72","human","No OTUs in our study showed significant phylogenetic signal for humans, and only a few OTUs were associated with any of the ten primate species in our study. "
"73","human","This finding could help to explain why relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify heritable microbial taxa in humans12. "
"74","human","Alternatively, intra-species diversity is greater in large human cohort studies compared to what we measured in this work, and this higher intra-species variance may obscure signals of coevolution. "
"75","human","Indeed, Ruminococcaceae taxa have previously been identified as keystone species in human and ruminant gut communities60. "
