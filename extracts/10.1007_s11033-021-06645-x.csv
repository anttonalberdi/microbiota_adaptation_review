"1","wild","2021 Abstract Background The gut microbiota is an emerging frontier in wildlife research and its importance to vertebrate health and physiology is becoming ever more apparent. "
"2","wild","Reptiles, in particular snakes, have not received the same attention given to other vertebrates and the composition of their wild gut microbiome remains understudied. "
"3","wild","Dallas Jason.dallas@siu.edu 1 Department of Biological Sciences, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA 2 Section of Zoology and Botany, State Museum of Pennsylvania, 300 North Street, Harrisburg, PA 17120, USA 3 Biology Department, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA 6436 Molecular Biology Reports (2021) 48:6435–6442 1 3 the only wild North American taxa examined. "
"4","wild","Despite B. petrii being present in all samples, its relative abundance varied wildly suggesting that it may be a transient member of the cloaca rather than a true resident of the gut. "

"7","model","The output model explained 48.3% and 21.9% of the variation among all samples on Axis 1 and Axis 2. "
"8","model","Costello EK, Gordon JI, Secor SM, Knight R (2010) Postprandial remodeling of the gut microbiota in Burmese pythons. "
"9","disease","Despite this, Mycoplasma can be common in the gut microbiota of lizards [7], turtles [39], snakes [14], and fish [40, 41] without the host exhibiting any signs of disease. "
"10","disease","In both species, many of the prominent bacterial taxa are known to be pathogenic— especially Mycoplasma—but there were no signs of disease in any sampled individual, so these taxa did not negatively affect host health. "
"11","environment","Few studies have examined how an environmental gradient can affect the microbiome composition, with some authors finding great overlap between habitats [21], while others noted shifts in microbiota concurrent with habitat variation [19, 20]. "
"12","environment","Briefly, a sterile alcohol wipe was used on the outside of the cloaca to minimize the chance of transient environmental microbes contaminating the cloacal swab. "
"13","environment","Identifying the microbiome of the water these species lived in could indicate if Tenericutes are transient and acquired from the environment or originate from another source. "
"14","environment","Expansion upon our findings through the inclusion of functional analyses would answer several questions raised here, and further assessing how the snake gut microbiome varies across dietary and environmental gradients will aid in addressing its resiliency to external microbes. "
