"1","wild","However, the correlation between the gut microbiome of wild animals and ARGs remains controversial. "
"2","wild","Here, based on the metagenomes of giant pandas (including three wild populations from the Qinling, Qionglai and Xiaoxiangling Mountains, and two major captive populations from Yaan and Chengdu), we investigated the potential correlation between the constitution of the gut microbiome and the composition of ARGs across the different geographic locations and living environments. "
"3","wild","The NMDS cluster analysis using Jaccard distance of the ARGs composition of the gut microbiome of wild giant pandas displayed a difference based on geographic location. "
"4","wild","Furthermore, we found that the Qinling population exhibited profound dissimilarities of both gut microbiome composition and ARGs (the highest proportion of Clostridium and vancomycin resistance genes) when compared to the other wild and captive populations studies, which was supported by previous giant panda whole-genome sequencing analysis. "
"5","wild","First, previous studies have found a difference in the gut microbiome community between wild and captive populations of giant pandas (Zhu et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2019). "
"6","wild","Second, the gut microbiome of wild pandas in the Shaanxi region (only one wild population in the Qinling Mountains) harbours a high proportion of Clostridiaceae (Zhu et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2017). "
"7","wild","Considering the potential correlation between the community of the gut microbiome and the composition of ARGs, there are no large-scale meta-analyses of the gut microbiome of giant pandas and the composition ARGs across wild and captive populations from different geographic areas. "
"8","wild","Here, based on the published metagenomes of giant pandas [including three wild populations from the Qinling (Wu et al., 2017), Qionglai (Guo et al., 2019) and Xiaoxiangling Mountains (Zhu et al., 2018a), and two major captive populations from Wolong (Guo et al., 2019) and Chengdu (Zhang et al., 2018)] by both our group and other groups, we mainly aimed to investigate the potential correlation between the structure of the gut microbiome and the composition of ARGs across different geographic locations and living environments. "
"9","wild","Results and discussion In this study, we analysed the metagenomes of 96 mammals: 19 meat-eating carnivorans (CA), ten omnivorous carnivorans (OC), 55 bamboo-eating carnivorans [49 giant panda samples: nine from the Qinling Mountains (QIN, wild), seven from the Qionglai Mountains (QIO, wild), 16 from the Xiaoxiangling Mountains (XXL, wild), seven from the Chengdu Breeding Center (CD, captive), ten from the Yaan research base of the Wolong Research Center (Yaan, captive) and six from red pandas in the Xiaoxiangling Mountains (wild)], and 12 herbivores (HE; Table S1). "
"10","wild","The wild giant panda habitats and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) structure (mean abundance). "
"11","wild","Six wild mountain giant panda populations: Qinling Mountains population (QIN), Minshan Mountains population (MS), Qionglai Mountains population (QIO), Daxiangling Mountains population (DXL), Xiaoxiangling Mountains population (XXL) and Liangshan Mountains population (LS). "
"12","wild","In this study, the metagenomes from five populations (three wild populations: QIN, QIO and XXL; two captive populations: CD and Yaan) were analysed. "

"15","wild","XXL, wild Xiaoxiangling giant panda population. "
"16","wild","RPxxl, wild Xiaoxiangling red panda population. "
"17","wild","In wild giant pandas, the mean abundance of Clostridium (Firmicutes) was highest in the QIN population (0.42  0.35), and the mean abundance of Pseudomonas (Proteobacteria) was highest in non-QIN populations (0.22  0.19 in Qionglai, 0.44  0.41 in XXL). "
"18","wild","Additionally, the mean abundance of Pseudomonas (Proteobacteria) was also highest in the XXL population of wild red pandas (0.61  0.38). "
"19","wild","However, the new finding here was the dissimilarity in the ARG composition between the captive and wild giant panda gut microbiome. "
"20","wild","By only taking into account the metagenomes of giant pandas, we also found a significant difference in both gut microbiome community and ARG composition between the captive and wild groups (Fig. "
"21","wild","For example, the mean abundance of tetracycline resistance genes was higher in captive populations (0.07  0.02 in Yaan and 0.07  0.04 in CD) than that found in wild populations (0.03  0.03 in QIN, 0.04  0.02 in Qionglai, and 0.02  0.02 in XXL). "

"26","wild","Hu et al. gut microbiome and resulted in the divergence with those in the wild giant pandas. "
"27","wild","The geographic divergence in the composition of ARGs in gut microbiome among wild giant panda mountain populations We then divided the giant panda metagenome samples into five groups based on their geographic locations and found a significant difference in both gut microbiome community and ARG composition (Fig. "
"28","wild","Notably, the QIN population exhibited a unique pattern of ARG types, with the abundance of the vancomycin (0.25  0.29) and bacitracin (0.22  0.26) resistance genes being the highest when compared to the other wild or captive populations (Fig. "
"29","wild","In regard to the ARG subtypes (Fig. 6 and Table S3), the mean abundance of vancomycin_vanS (0.21  0.30) and bacitracin_bacA (0.22  0.26) was the highest in the gut microbiome of giant pandas from the QIN population when compared to the other wild or captive populations. "
"30","wild","In the QIN giant panda population (wild), the vancomycin resistance genes (e.g. vancomycin_vanS) were identified in Clostridium (Fig. 6 and Fig. "

"36","wild","Here, the gut microbiome of the QIN population was found to have the highest proportion of Clostridium species (Table S4), as well as vancomycin resistance genes when compared to other wild and captive populations, which were mainly found in Clostridium species. "
"37","wild","Furthermore, maintaining the health of the captive giant panda population is important for the translocation of some small and isolated wild populations. "
"38","wild","Moreover, the care for the wild injured giant pandas should assess their mountain source and the potential antibiotic resistance by Pseudomonas (e.g. in non-QIN mountain populations) and vancomycin resistance (e.g. in QIN mountain population). "
"39","wild","The 49 giant panda metagenomes came from five populations: three wild populations from the Qinling (Wu et al., 2017), Qionglai (Guo et al., 2019) and Xiaoxiangling Mountains (Zhu et al., 2018a), and two major captive populations from Yaan (Guo et al., 2019) and Chengdu (Zhang et al., 2018). "
"40","wild","Lastly, we further evaluated the effect of geographic location in the giant panda samples, which were divided into five groups: QIN, wild Qinling population; QIO, wild Qionglai population; XXL, wild Xiaoxiangling population; CD, captive Chengdu population; and Yaan, captive Yaan population.
