"1","wild","Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in recovery of C. jejuni from ampicillin-treated mice inoculated with a C. jejuni virulence mutant (flgL strain) compared to recovery of mice inoculated with the C. jejuni wildtype strain or the C. jejuni complemented isolate (flgL/flgL). "
"2","wild","The C. jejuni F38011 wild-type clinical strain, the flgL mutant, and the flgL/flgL complemented isolate were used throughout this study. "
"3","wild","Ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice were challenged with the C. jejuni wild-type strain, a flgL mutant, the flgL/flgL complemented mutant or PBS (uninfected). "
"4","wild","The C. jejuni wild-type strain was recovered from the colon, spleen, and MLN at all time points, with the exception that no organisms were recovered from the spleen at 35 dpi, indicating that ampicillin treatment promotes stable colonization in CBA/J mice. "
"5","wild","Although not all of the mice inoculated with the C. jejuni flgL mutant completely cleared the infection, there were significantly fewer C. jejuni bacteria recovered from the colons of mice infected with the mutant than from the colons of those infected with the wild-type strain (Fig. "
"6","wild","The colons of animals infected with either the C. jejuni wild-type strain or the flgL/flgL complemented isolate showed signs of edema and apparent stool softening in contrast to uninfected mice or mice given the flgL mutant (see Fig. "
"7","wild","IL-6 levels were not significantly different between mice infected with the C. jejuni wild-type strain and the uninfected control at 2 dpi (2.9  1.0 versus 6.7  1.2 ng/g tissue), 7 dpi (9.5  0.5 versus 3.3  2.4 ng/g tissue), or 35 dpi (2.6  1.1 versus 2.6  0.9 ng/g tissue). "
"8","wild","CBA/J mice were treated with ampicillin and inoculated by oral gavage with a C. jejuni wild-type strain, a flgL mutant, the flgL/flgL isolate, or PBS (uninfected). "
"9","wild","More specifically, we found that a flgL mutant shows a significant reduction in its ability to colonize mice compared to the ability of a C. jejuni wild-type isolate. "
"10","fitness","This finding is consistent with work performed with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, whereby flagellar defects were found to impair the fitness of a pathogen due to its inability to utilize the nutrients released in the inflamed intestine (44). "
