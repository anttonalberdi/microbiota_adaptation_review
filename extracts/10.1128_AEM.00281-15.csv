"1","wild","Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in recovery of C. jejuni from ampicillin-treated mice inoculated with a C. jejuni virulence mutant (flgL strain) compared to recovery of mice inoculated with the C. jejuni wildtype strain or the C. jejuni complemented isolate (flgL/flgL). "
"2","wild","The C. jejuni F38011 wild-type clinical strain, the flgL mutant, and the flgL/flgL complemented isolate were used throughout this study. "
"3","wild","Ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice were challenged with the C. jejuni wild-type strain, a flgL mutant, the flgL/flgL complemented mutant or PBS (uninfected). "
"4","wild","The C. jejuni wild-type strain was recovered from the colon, spleen, and MLN at all time points, with the exception that no organisms were recovered from the spleen at 35 dpi, indicating that ampicillin treatment promotes stable colonization in CBA/J mice. "
"5","wild","Although not all of the mice inoculated with the C. jejuni flgL mutant completely cleared the infection, there were significantly fewer C. jejuni bacteria recovered from the colons of mice infected with the mutant than from the colons of those infected with the wild-type strain (Fig. "
"6","wild","The colons of animals infected with either the C. jejuni wild-type strain or the flgL/flgL complemented isolate showed signs of edema and apparent stool softening in contrast to uninfected mice or mice given the flgL mutant (see Fig. "
"7","wild","IL-6 levels were not significantly different between mice infected with the C. jejuni wild-type strain and the uninfected control at 2 dpi (2.9  1.0 versus 6.7  1.2 ng/g tissue), 7 dpi (9.5  0.5 versus 3.3  2.4 ng/g tissue), or 35 dpi (2.6  1.1 versus 2.6  0.9 ng/g tissue). "
"8","wild","CBA/J mice were treated with ampicillin and inoculated by oral gavage with a C. jejuni wild-type strain, a flgL mutant, the flgL/flgL isolate, or PBS (uninfected). "
"9","wild","More specifically, we found that a flgL mutant shows a significant reduction in its ability to colonize mice compared to the ability of a C. jejuni wild-type isolate. "
"10","fitness","This finding is consistent with work performed with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, whereby flagellar defects were found to impair the fitness of a pathogen due to its inability to utilize the nutrients released in the inflamed intestine (44). "
"11","mutant","Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in recovery of C. jejuni from ampicillin-treated mice inoculated with a C. jejuni virulence mutant (flgL strain) compared to recovery of mice inoculated with the C. jejuni wildtype strain or the C. jejuni complemented isolate (flgL/flgL).

"12","mutant","The C. jejuni F38011 wild-type clinical strain, the flgL mutant, and the flgL/flgL complemented isolate were used throughout this study. "
"13","mutant","Ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice were challenged with the C. jejuni wild-type strain, a flgL mutant, the flgL/flgL complemented mutant or PBS (uninfected). "
"14","mutant","We included the C. jejuni flgL mutant in our analysis because it does not produce a functional flagellum. "
"15","mutant","This mutant should be attenuated in mice as C. jejuni utilizes the flagellum for both motility and secretion of virulence proteins that are delivered to host epithelial cells (29, 30). "
"16","mutant","Although not all of the mice inoculated with the C. jejuni flgL mutant completely cleared the infection, there were significantly fewer C. jejuni bacteria recovered from the colons of mice infected with the mutant than from the colons of those infected with the wild-type strain (Fig. "
"17","mutant","The colons of animals infected with either the C. jejuni wild-type strain or the flgL/flgL complemented isolate showed signs of edema and apparent stool softening in contrast to uninfected mice or mice given the flgL mutant (see Fig. "
"18","mutant","CBA/J mice were treated with ampicillin and inoculated by oral gavage with a C. jejuni wild-type strain, a flgL mutant, the flgL/flgL isolate, or PBS (uninfected). "
"19","mutant","More specifically, we found that a flgL mutant shows a significant reduction in its ability to colonize mice compared to the ability of a C. jejuni wild-type isolate. "
"20","model","This study provides a simple method to alter murine intestinal microorganisms, thereby changing susceptibility to C. jejuni colonization of mice, and may be applicable for additional in vivo Campylobacter models. "
"21","model","Taken together, the data indicate that ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice demonstrate stable colonization with high pathogen burden and spread to extraintestinal tissues but lack the parameters of a disease model (limited histopathology and cytokine response). "
"22","model","Based on these results, ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice provide an ideal model to investigate and identify inhibitory microbiota that normally prevents C. jejuni colonization. "
"23","model","We developed a colonization resistance model in which ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice were given oral inoculations with E. faecalis prior to infection with C. jejuni. "
"24","model","We first attempted to reproduce this model, with the idea of possibly refining the methods to identify a simpler method of altering the intestinal microbiota in a manner to permit C. jejuni colonization (16). "
"25","model","We then performed studies using the streptomycin ad libitum model, which has been used to investigate Salmonella pathogenesis (42). "
"26","model","However, the animals in this model had cleared C. jejuni by 2 dpi, demonstrating that Campylobacter differs from Salmonella in this model (data not shown). "
"27","model","Mucus colonization as a determinant of pathogenicity in intestinal infection by Campylobacter jejuni: a mouse cecal model. "
"28","model","Novel murine infection models provide deep insights into the “menage a trois” of Campylobacter jejuni, microbiota and host innate immunity. "
"29","model","Campylobacter jejuni molecular mechanisms and animal models of colonization and disease. "
"30","model","Development of a peptidoglycan-polysaccharide murine model of Crohn’s disease: effect of genetic background. "
"31","model","Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host. "
"32","model","A novel mouse model of Campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis reveals key proinflammatory and tissue protective roles for Toll-like receptor signaling during infection. "
"33","disease model","Taken together, the data indicate that ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice demonstrate stable colonization with high pathogen burden and spread to extraintestinal tissues but lack the parameters of a disease model (limited histopathology and cytokine response). "
