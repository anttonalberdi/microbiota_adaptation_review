"1","wild","Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in recovery of C. jejuni from ampicillin-treated mice inoculated with a C. jejuni virulence mutant (flgL strain) compared to recovery of mice inoculated with the C. jejuni wildtype strain or the C. jejuni complemented isolate (flgL/flgL).

"4","wild","The C. jejuni wild-type strain was recovered from the colon, spleen, and MLN at all time points, with the exception that no organisms were recovered from the spleen at 35 dpi, indicating that ampicillin treatment promotes stable colonization in CBA/J mice. "
"5","wild","Although not all of the mice inoculated with the C. jejuni flgL mutant completely cleared the infection, there were significantly fewer C. jejuni bacteria recovered from the colons of mice infected with the mutant than from the colons of those infected with the wild-type strain (Fig. "

"10","fitness","This finding is consistent with work performed with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, whereby flagellar defects were found to impair the fitness of a pathogen due to its inability to utilize the nutrients released in the inflamed intestine (44). "
"11","mutant","Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in recovery of C. jejuni from ampicillin-treated mice inoculated with a C. jejuni virulence mutant (flgL strain) compared to recovery of mice inoculated with the C. jejuni wildtype strain or the C. jejuni complemented isolate (flgL/flgL).

"50","environment","Intestinal microbiota provide colonization resistance to pathogens in multiple ways, including competition for niches by preventing pathogens from attaching to their target sites, depleting essential nutrients for pathogen viability, producing bacteriocins or other metabolites that inhibit pathogen function, producing organic acids that alter intraluminal pH levels to acidic conditions unfavorable to pathogens, or utilizing the limited oxygen available in the gut contributing to the anaerobic and capnophilic environment (35–38).
