"1","wild","Reintroduction, as an effective strategy for wild population recovery and genetic diversity maintenance for endangered populations, usually takes captive populations as rewilding resource. "
"2","wild","While, little is known about the compositional and functional differences of gut microbiota between captive and wild populations, especially for large carnivores, like Amur tiger. "
"3","wild","In this study, high throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (amplicon sequencing) and metagenomics were used to analyze the composition and function variations of gut microbiota communities between captive and wild Amur tiger populations based on total 35 fecal samples (13 from captive tigers and 22 from wild tigers). "
"4","wild","Our results showed that captive Amur tigers have higher alpha diversity in gut microbiota, but that the average unweighted UniFrac distance of bacterial taxa among wild Amur tigers was much larger. "
"5","wild","It was indicated that the diet habit and environment difference between captive and wild populations lead to composition differences of gut microbiota and then resulted in significant differences in functions. "
"6","wild","These contrasts of functional and compositional variations in gut microbiota between wild and captive Amur tigers are essential insights for guiding conservation management and policy decision-making, and call for more attention on the influence of gut microbiota on the ability of captive animals to survive in the wild. "
"7","wild","The increasing knowledge of gut microbiota is mainly derived from studies on animals that are germ-free and laboratory-based, which has limited application to animals in the wild (Kohl and Dearing, 2014; Kreisinger et  al., 2014). "
"8","wild","However, the wild population dropped sharply in the late 19th century, due to habitat fragmentation, indiscriminate poaching, and other caused by intensified human disturbance, leading it to be highly endangered throughout its range (Wang et al., 2018). "
"9","wild","The Chinese government has shown great effort to protect this endangered big cat, especially after the leaders of 13 countries reached the consensus on doubling the wild tiger population at St. "
"10","wild","What is more, the Siberian Tiger Park in Heilongjiang province of China, the largest captive breeding center for Amur tiger in the world keeps more than 1,400 individuals and could provide sufficient resources for reintroducing Amur tigers into the wild in China (http://www. dongbeihulinyuan.com/index.php, in Chinese). "
"11","wild","Their home-range size can often be  up to 390  km2 and predominantly prey on native medium and large ungulates, such as red deer (Cervus elaphus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and roe deer (Capreolus pygargus; Jiang et al., 2014). "
"12","wild","While, captive individuals live in an environment greatly different from wild populations, both in diet and environment, and they are confined to a very limited area and fed duck, chicken, and beef daily. "
"13","wild","Even so, many relevant studies suggested that captive Amur tiger still retain the abilities of native prey recognition and has similar extent and distribution of genetic variation found within wild population (Henry et  al., 2009; Wang et  al., 2019). "
"14","wild","However, it is still unknown whether these substantial diet and environmental differences between captive and wild tigers would result in variations within gut microbiota, and how they may alter gut microbiota functionality. "
"15","wild","In this study, we conducted an analysis of the fecal microbial diversity and function in both wild and captive Amur tiger populations to investigate (1) the gut microbiota compositional variation between captive and wild tigers, (2) the core microbiota in Amur tigers, (3) the gut microbiota’s functional differences between captive and wild tigers, and (4) how the gut microbiota composition of the Amur tiger is related to its the functions? "
"16","wild","To guide the reintroduction of captive individuals to wild, our research systematically and comprehensively investigates the variations of gut microbiota between captive and wild Amur tigers to provide valuable references for further understanding co-development and co-evolution of gut microbiota between captive and wild large carnivores and to also provide important management considerations for the reintroduction of captive Amur tigers to the wild. "
"17","wild","MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampled Materials Fecal samples of Amur tigers were collected from both captive and wild individuals. "
"18","wild","16S rRNA Gene Sequencing We extracted microbial community genomes from frozen fecal samples of 22 wild individuals and 13 captive individuals using the E.Z.N.A."
"19","wild","Taxonomic data were then assigned to each representative sequence using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier and used the Mann-Whitney U test to assess the significant differences between wild and captive tigers. "
"20","wild","To analyze the differences in core microbiome between captive and wild populations, the t test in the STAMP software was used to check for significant differences in genus levels between the sample groups. "
"21","wild","Metagenome Sequencing and Analysis To further explore the functions variation, we  filtrated six wild and six captive samples belonging different individuals for metagenomic sequencing analysis on Illumina sequencing HiSeq platform. "
"22","wild","RESULTS Through species identification and microsatellite genetic markers, 150 of 163 fecal samples collected from the wild were confirmed to be  tigers and a total of 30 individuals were identified. "
"23","wild","16S rRNA Sequencing Description We performed amplicon sequencing of the V3 and V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene on fecal samples collected from captive and wild tigers. "
"24","wild","Composition Differences in Gut Microbiota Between Captive and Wild Amur Tiger Populations Sequencing analysis indicated that species richness of gut microbiota was significantly different between wild and captive tigers (Chao1: wild, 138.41  ±  78.93; captive, 292.79  ±  73.56; p  <  0.001) and other indexes showed similar results, such as Shannon (wild, 2.77  ±  1.22; captive, 4.19  ±  0.39; p  <  0.001), Simpson (wild, 0.66  ±  0.24; captive, 0.89  ±  0.04; p  <  0.001), and Observed species (wild, 102.77  ±  58.58; captive, 182  ±  34.33; p  <  0.001; Figure  2A). "
"25","wild","We  used unweighted UniFrac distances throughout the analysis because they provided better clustering to separate the wild and captive group than weighted UniFrac distance. "
"26","wild","The non-parametric ANOSIM detected that the inter-group differences between wild and captive ones were significantly greater than the intra-group differences in community composition and abundance (r  =  0.33, p  =  0.001). "
"27","wild","The results showed that the mean value of unweighted UniFrac distance was 0.717 in wild tigers and was 0.551 in captive tigers. "
"28","wild","We  classified our OTUs to the level of genus, and found that the gut microbiota of wild tigers were dominated by Sphingomonas, Collinsella, Clostridium_sensu_stricto, and Lysinibacillus, while the most abundant genera for captive tigers were Collinsella, Blautia, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides. "
"29","wild","Total 76 genera were significantly different in abundance between wild and captive tigers, for instance, the level of gram-positive Lysinibacillus and gram-negative Sphingomonas were much higher in the wild tigers (some of them were showed in Figure 2C). "
"30","wild","The gut bacterial communities differed in relative abundance between wild and captive tigers also shows in other categories, total four phyla, 29 families were significantly different based on the Mann-Whitney U analysis. "
"31","wild","The four most dominant phyla, which significantly different between wild and captive tigers, were Actinobacteria ( X   =  15.54  ±  21.56%; X   =  28.16  ±  23.02%), Fusobacteria ( X   =  0.86  ±  1.9%; X   =  11.92  ±  12.95%), and Bacteroidetes ( X   =  1.77  ±  3.45%; X   =  10.54  ±  12.59%; Figure  2D). "
"32","wild","The differences in core microbiome showed that, in genus level, the relative abundance of Blautia, Faecalimonas, and Lachnoclostridium were significantly higher in captive Amur tiger than the wild population, especially for Blautia, the relative abundance in captive Amur tigers was 1.6 times of wild tigers (Figure 3A). "
"33","wild","According to the LEfse result of the enzymes, many families had significantly higher in wild tigers, including glycoside hydrolases (GH) families, carbohydrate esterases (CEs), and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), conversely, in captive tigers, the main difference in GH families (Figure  4B). "
"34","wild","Relationship Between the Gut Microbiota Compositions and Functions To identify the patterns of covariation, we clustered the taxonomy ID from wild individuals into three clusters by using the ward method. "
"35","wild","The clustering pattern of gut microbiota of captive Amur tiger was similar to that of wild tiger. "
"36","wild","The correlations between pathway partition and taxonomy ID clusters were compared to analyze the functional differences of gut microbiota between wild and captive tigers. "
"37","wild","We  found that taxonomy ID of wild tigers were positive associated with the categories of metabolism FIGURE 1 | Diagram of sample collection of wild Amur tiger (150) and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing (22) and shotgun metagenome sequencing (12). "

"42","wild","While, due to technology and samples collection of wild tigers, this part of the research is still limited. "
"43","wild","In this study, we  performed a metagenomic inventory of 22 wild individuals and 13 captive individuals to investigate the variations of the gut microbiota composition and function traits and their correlations both in wild and captive Amur tigers. "
"44","wild","Moreover, we found that wild tigers harbor higher difference in unweighted UniFrac distance, which implies that the composition of the gut microbiota among wild individuals showed less overlap than captive ones and have higher divergence A B FIGURE 3 | t test shows a significant of genus between the wild and captive Amur tiger, the colors were highlighted in green (A). "

"46","wild","According to the result of PCoA and Anosim, there was a clear difference between these two groups, demonstrating that the bacterial communities differed greatly between wild and captive populations. "
"47","wild","As shown in Figure 2D, the differences at genus levels between captive and wild tigers were obvious. "
"48","wild","The relative abundance of Sphingomonas and Lysinibacillus were remarkably higher in the wild tigers, while Blautia, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides had a significant increase in captive tigers. "
"49","wild","The reasons for the composition differences in the gut microbiota of wild and captive Amur tigers may be  due to the combined effect of diet and habitat heterogeneity. "
"50","wild","There are more than 10 kinds of animals that were preyed by tigers, and wild tigers often successfully hunt large prey about once a week (Gu et  al., 2018). "
"51","wild","Therefore, in the gut microbiota of wild Amur tigers, a variety of gut taxonomy are commonly found in the environment, and the dominant bacteria in captive tigers are related to nutrients consumption. "
"52","wild","Differences in Gut Microbiota Functions Between Wild and Captive Amur Tigers This study uncovered the significant differences in biological functions of the gut microbiota between wild and captive Amur tigers. "
"53","wild","Twelve pathways belonging to five major categories (environmental information processing, cellular processes, organismal systems, human diseases, and not included in pathway or brite) were more abundant in wild tigers. "
"54","wild","These pathways are more prevalent in wild tigers, possibly because they faced more diverse conditions in the wild than in captive tigers, such as expanding their territory and home range and hunting various prey to obtain energy supply. "
"55","wild","The relative abundance of GH2, GH3, GH16, GH20, GH29, GH35, GH89, GH92, GH97, and GH109 were higher in captive tigers, whereas GH17, GH24, and GH73 were higher in wild tigers. "
"56","wild","This result was consistent with the hypothesis that captive Amur tigers in stable food sources required more enzymes for metabolism than wild tigers (Pitta et  al., 2016), proving that disturbing effects of dietary interventions. "
"57","wild","By the correlation result, we  found that the Firmicutes (Clostridium) in wild tigers was positively correlated with the function of infectious disease, a similar conclusion was reached from another analysis showed that Clostridium perfringens was the second most common bacteria that cause bacterial illnesses (Scharff, 2012; Huang et  al., 2019). "
"58","wild","The Cluster 3 of taxonomy ID in wild tigers could promote the three main categories of environmental information processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems, which were also the main differences of gut microbiota functions between wild and captive tigers. "
"59","wild","Research Implications Since differences in gut microbiota between captive and wild tigers were largely influenced by dietary habits and living environment (Xue et al., 2013; Bletz et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2019), we  suggest that adapting the gut microbial community of captive tigers to that of wild tigers should be  considered as one of the important preparation stages for reintroduction and an indispensable metric to evaluate whether reintroduction should be  attempted. "
"60","wild","Furthermore, to achieve this, we  propose the following considerations to be  used in the reintroduction preparation process: Rewilding training should not only consider an animal’s predation ability but also its adaptability to food and environment. "
"61","wild","Additionally, the rewilding site should be  located in a natural environment similar to where the tiger will be introduced. "
"62","wild","Over time, their diet should be gradually replaced by accurate potential prey from the wild, and we  should minimize human and drug intervention. "
"63","wild","Ideally, the rewilding training site would gradually increase in size over time until it is large enough to include most of the wild potential prey species and habitat types in the site to help the tigers establish a wild-adapted gut microbiota. "
"64","wild","It is also necessary to extend the duration of rewilding training to make sure that gut microbiota could successfully evolve from captive structure to a wild structure. "
"65","wild","A monitoring database on the gut microbiota of wild Amur tigers and their dynamics should be  established as contrasting data. "
"66","wild","Once the rewilding training is able to significantly reduce the difference in composition and function of gut microbiota between captive and wild tigers, the reintroduction will likely have a higher chance of success. "
"67","wild","Comparing analysis identified significant variations of gut microbiota composition and functions between captive and wild populations and also indicated that diet and environment have a great influence on these variations. "
