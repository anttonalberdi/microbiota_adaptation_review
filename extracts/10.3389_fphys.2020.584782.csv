"11","human","Lotus leaf prevents fat accumulation in humans and may have similar effects on fish. "
"12","human","The biological potential to lower blood lipid and the anti-obesity effects of lotus leaf extract have been shown in humans (Lee et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015) and rats (Su et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2017) and indicate that dietary lotus leaf extract also may have the potential to suppress excess lipid accumulation in fish. "
"13","human","The regulatory mechanism of dietary lotus leaf extract on lipid metabolism is well defined in mammals, such as humans (Lee et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015) and rats (Su et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2017). "
