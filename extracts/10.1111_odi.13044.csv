"1","wild","STZ and wild-type (WT) mice were orally administered P. gingivalis (STZPg, WTPg) or saline (STZco, WTco). "
"2","wild","Materials and Methods Mice Four-week-old male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Sankyo Labo Service Corporation, Inc. "
"3","adaptation","Metabolic adaptation to a high-fat diet is associated with a change in the gut microbiota. "
"4","inbred","Effects of vendor and genetic background on the composition of the fecal microbiota of inbred mice. "
"5","model","The role of the intestinal microbiota in insulin-deficient diabetes has also been investigated using rodent models. "
"6","model","Gene expression levels were normalized against 36B4 expression levels. 36b4 has been applied as a reference gene in previous studies that used diabetic mouse models (Katagiri et al., 2016; Ouchi et al., 2010) and is considered to be reliable and suitable as an internal control. "
"7","model","The prevalence of Mucispirillum was increased under inflammatory conditions in a rodent model of active colitis (Berry et al., 2012; El Aidy et al., 2014; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Rooks et al., 2014). "
"8","model","A recent mouse model study by van der Lugt (van der Lugt et al, 2018) showed that enrichment of potential pathobionts, including Desulfovibrio spp., and a decline of the health-promoting Akkermansia spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were observed with aging. "
"9","model","We used this mouse model for evaluating the influence of insulin deficiency on gut microbiota and subsequent systemic conditions. "
"10","model","Many studies have also described impaired glucose tolerance together with alterations of the gut microbiota composition in T2DM mouse models (Cani et al., 2008; Serino et al., 2012), disturbance of the metabolic system in adipose tissues, and A cc ep te d A rt ic le This article is protected by copyright.
