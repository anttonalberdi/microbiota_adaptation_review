"1","wild","A pglA deletion mutant was impaired in both pathogenesis and gut persistence in M. sexta and produced enhanced biofilms compared with the wild type in an in vitro polystyrene plate assay. "
"2","wild","All treatments were compared with strain OG1RF results, and strains were considered defective for persistence if they differed from the wild type with P  0.05. "
"3","wild","Both the wildtype OG1RF and OG1Sp strains were confirmed to have gelatinase activity in vitro by growing on agar plates containing gelatin and observing a zone of clearing (24). "
"4","wild","Student’s t test was used to compare each mutant strain to the wild type. "
"5","wild","Multiple wild-type control groups receiving injections of various doses were used in each experiment, and experimental treatments were later compared only to a single control treatment based on the similarity of the viable injected dose as determined by plating inocula. "
"6","wild","Survival curves were analyzed in Prism using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test, and strains were considered defective for pathogenesis if they differed from the wild type with P  0.05 in every experiment. "
"7","wild","Strains that produced inconsistent results (defective in at least one experiment and indistinguishable from the wild type in at least one experiment) were designated “inconsistent” for pathogenesis. "
"8","wild","The crystal violet solution was removed by vacuum filtration, and wells were washed and dried as described above and destained for 1 h using 1 TABLE 1 List of strains and plasmids Strain or plasmid Description Source or reference Strains Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF Spontaneous mutant of OG1, resistant to rifampin and fusidic acid 20 Enterococcus faecalis OG1RFradA Alternative names: OG1RFOG1RF_10039, OG1RFEF0040 This work Enterococcus faecalis OG1RFpglA Alternative names: OG1RFOG1RF_11582, OG1RFEF1918 This work Enterococcus faecalis OG1RFrpoN Alternative names: OG1RFOG1RF_10514, OG1RFEF0782 This work Enterococcus faecalis OG1RFEF1144 Alternative names: OG1RFOG1RF_10921, OG1RFEF1144 This work Enterococcus faecalis OG1RFmenB Alternative names: OG1RFOG1RF_10330, OG1RFEF0445 This work Enterococcus faecalis OG1RFrnc2 Alternative names: OG1RFOG1RF_12365, OG1RFEF3097 22 Enterococcus faecalis OG1RFpglA_TCDR_97 Complemented pglA mutant with wild-type copy of pglA gene on the chromosome This work Enterococcus faecalis OG1Sp Spontaneous mutant of OG1; resistant to spectinomycin 19 Escherichia coli DH5 General cloning host New England Biolabs Escherichia coli EC1000 Carries repA allele for replication of pCJK47 and pCJK141; resistant to kanamycin 37 Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 Laboratory strain encoding a 6-PGL gene 30 Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Host strain for pET28b Life Technologies Escherichia coli BW25113 Keio collection parent strain 29 Escherichia coli JW0750-3 BW25113 pgl deletion strain 29 Plasmids pCJK47 Vector for general allelic exchange in E. faecalis: repA dependent, p-cl-Phe sensitive, erm resistant, lacZ 19 pCJK141 Vector for allelic exchange in E. faecalis: repA dependent, p-cl-Phe sensitive, erm resistant, lacZ 23 pBluescript KS High-copy-number ColE1-based phagemid with f1 origin in positive orientation and Kpn-Sac polylinker Agilent Genomics pBluescript/pglA pBluescript with promoterless copy of pglA from E. faecalis OG1RF This work pBluescript/pgl pBluescript with promoterless copy of pgl from E. coli K-12 MG1655 This work pET28b/EF1918-C-His pET28b with pglA from E. faecalis OG1RF This work Holt et al. 398 iai.asm.org January 2015 Volume 83 Number 1Infection and Immunity D ow nl oa de d fr om h ttp s: //j ou rn al s. as m .o rg /jo ur na l/i ai o n 22 J an ua ry 2 02 2 by 5 .1 86 .1 21 .1 28 . volume of 80:20 ethanol:acetone solution per well.
