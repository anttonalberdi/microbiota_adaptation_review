"1","wild","Eggs were collected from females (N = 12) during the early and late portion of the spawning run in 2007 in a wild population from Black Lake, MI. "
"2","wild","Body size and survival of hatcheryand wildproduced larvae as a function of feeding frequency and alternate food type. "
"3","wild","Effect of natural and artificial diets on seasonal changes in fatty acid composition and total body lipid content of wild and hatcheryreared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) parrsmolt. "
"4","fitness","Fatty acid transfer to the egg during vitellogenesis is associated with female nutritional status (Frémont et al., 1984; Navas et al., 1998), suggesting that variability in HUFA’s and other PUFAs during vitellogenesis, may have lasting fitness consequences. "
"5","fitness","Highly fecund mothers sacrifice offspring survival to maximize fitness. "

"
"7","adaptat","Population structure attributable to reproductive time: Isolation by time and adaptation by time. "
"8","model","The particular maternal effects of propagule size, especially egg size: Patterns, models, quality of evidence and interpretations. "
"9","model","Development of a bioenergetics model for fish embryos and larvae during the yolk feeding period. "
"10","disease","Additionally, thiamine deficient Sterlet sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus) demonstrated disease symptoms including yolk sac deformation, loss of equilibrium and erratic swimming behavior (Ghiasi et al., 2017). "
"11","environment","2021;00:1–9. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jai  |  1© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH 1  | INTRODUC TION Trait adaptation, specifically, the development of suites of morphological, behavioral, physiological, and life history traits tied to environmental conditions at the time of reproduction can have farreaching consequences at individual and population levels (Hendry & Day, 2005). "
"12","environment","Embryonic and larval developmental time varies as a function of environmental factors (e.g., temperature, stream discharge, etc., Gillooly et al., 2002; Jaworski & Kamler, 2002; Jay et al., 2020; O’Connor et al., 2007). "
"13","environment","Therefore, maternal effects, including female resource expenditures and provisioning of eggs conditional on environments experienced prior to and at the time and location of spawning can significantly influence offspring phenotypic traits (Mousseau & Fox, 1998), and can collectively contribute to embryonic and larval development (Einum & Fleming, 2000; Jaworski & Kamler, 2002) and dispersal (Edwards et al., 2007). "
"14","environment","Knowledge of physiological processes and characteristics of eggs and associations with essential nutrients, environmental conditions experienced during embryogenesis, survival during embryogenesis, and early posthatch periods would greatly aid efforts to predict populationwide natural recruitment and to direct supplementation programs. "
"15","environment","Information is lacking regarding maternal effects in lake sturgeon associated with egg provisioning, and the utilization of essential nutrient reserves deposited in yolks such as lipids and antioxidant vitamins in relation to environmental regimes associated with the timing of reproduction. "
"16","environment","Because free thiamine is scarce in natural environments, organisms have evolved various means of acquisition, in large part associated with dietary consumption (Bettendorff, 2007, review in Kraft & Angert, 2017). "
"17","environment","Survival and growth of Lake Sturgeon during early life stages as a function of rearing environment. "
"18","environment","Gamete and larval collection methods and hatchery rearing environments affect levels of genetic diversity in early life stages of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). "
"19","laboratory","Following sampling, eggs were frozen in the field with dry ice, transported to the laboratory, photographed and measured, and stored at −80℃ until analyses were performed (Ghiasi et al., 2014, 2017). "
