"1","wild","To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3−/− mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. "
"2","wild","We found that the HFD-fed Clcn3−/− mice displayed a significant decrease in obesity-induced body weight gain and abdominal visceral fat accumulation as well as an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism as compared with HFD-fed wild-type mice. "
"3","wild","Our previous study has shown that the loss of Clcn3 significantly decreases the plasma levels of glucose, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) and protects against IR compared with wild-type mice in a type 2 diabetes mouse model induced by a high sucrose/ fat diet following low-dose streptozotocin [12]. "
"4","wild","The HFD-induced obesity model was established in Clcn3+/+ wild-type (WT) and Clcn3−/− knockout (KO) mice. "
"5","adaptation","Differential adaptation of human gut microbiota to bariatric surgery-induced weight loss: links with metabolic and low-grade inflammation markers. "
"6","model","To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3−/− mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. "
"7","model","Accumulating evidence from animal models and human patients of inflammatory bowel disease also suggests that ClC-3 is important for inflammatory processes [10]. "
"8","model","Our previous study has shown that the loss of Clcn3 significantly decreases the plasma levels of glucose, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) and protects against IR compared with wild-type mice in a type 2 diabetes mouse model induced by a high sucrose/ fat diet following low-dose streptozotocin [12]. "
"9","model","In the present study, we established a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model in Clcn3−/− (KO) mice and investigated the effects of Clcn3 on HFD-induced obesity and Received: 4 August 2018 Accepted: 25 March 2019 Published online: 5 June 2019 1Department of Pharmacology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China; 2Department of Anesthesiology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China; 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China; 4Institute for Engineering and Medicine, Department of Chemical and Life Science Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, 601 West Main Street, Richmond, VA 23284-3028, USA; 5Department of Anesthesiology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China and 6Departments of Surgery, Physiology and Pharmacology, Institute of Medical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada Correspondence: Guan-lei Wang (wangglei@mail.sysu.edu.cn) or Xiao-miao Zhao (zhaoxmiao@163.com) These authors contributed equally: Ming-ming Ma, Chen-chen Jin, Xue-lian Huang www.nature.com/aps © CPS and SIMM 2019 obesity-associated ATM inflammation.

"10","model","The HFD-induced obesity model was established in Clcn3+/+ wild-type (WT) and Clcn3−/− knockout (KO) mice. "
"11","model","Accumulating evidence in obese mouse models has documented that the inhibition of M1 macrophage polarization is an effective strategy for attenuating adipose tissue inflammation and IR [5, 22]. "
"12","model","Similar beneficial effects of Clcn3 deficiency on disrupted glucose and lipid metabolism have been found in a high sucrose/fat, lowdose STZ induced T2DMmouse model [12]. "
"13","model","Because the global Clcn3 knockout produces complex compensatory changes, further investigation in Clcn3 conditional knockout mouse models will be helpful to elucidate the role of Clcn3 in obesity and obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic changes. "
"14","model","Adipose tissue remodeling and obesity. "
"15","model","Deficiency of volumeregulated ClC-3 chloride channel attenuates cerebrovascular remodelling in DOCA-salt hypertension. "
"16","model","In vivo quantification of subcutaneous and visceral adiposity by micro-computed tomography in a small animal model. "
"17","knockout","Our previous work has shown significant alleviation of type 2 diabetes in Clcn3 knockout (Clcn3−/−) mice. "
"18","knockout","The HFD-induced obesity model was established in Clcn3+/+ wild-type (WT) and Clcn3−/− knockout (KO) mice. "
"19","knockout","These results might exclude the influence from global Clcn3 knockout on eating behavior that may be due to the degeneration of hippocampal neurons where adipocyte derived leptin has binding sites [17]. "
"20","knockout","DISCUSSION In the present study, we have provided the first and strong evidence that downregulation of Clcn3 was a crucial protective factor against diet-induced obesity because Clcn3 knockout attenuated HFD-induced body weight gain, abdominal adipose volume expansion, and glucose and lipid disorders. "
"21","knockout","Because the global Clcn3 knockout produces complex compensatory changes, further investigation in Clcn3 conditional knockout mouse models will be helpful to elucidate the role of Clcn3 in obesity and obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic changes. "
