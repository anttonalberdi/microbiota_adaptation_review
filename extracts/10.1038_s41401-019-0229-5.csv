"1","wild","To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3−/− mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. "
"2","wild","We found that the HFD-fed Clcn3−/− mice displayed a significant decrease in obesity-induced body weight gain and abdominal visceral fat accumulation as well as an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism as compared with HFD-fed wild-type mice. "
"3","wild","Our previous study has shown that the loss of Clcn3 significantly decreases the plasma levels of glucose, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) and protects against IR compared with wild-type mice in a type 2 diabetes mouse model induced by a high sucrose/ fat diet following low-dose streptozotocin [12]. "
"4","wild","The HFD-induced obesity model was established in Clcn3+/+ wild-type (WT) and Clcn3−/− knockout (KO) mice. "
"5","adaptation","Differential adaptation of human gut microbiota to bariatric surgery-induced weight loss: links with metabolic and low-grade inflammation markers. "
