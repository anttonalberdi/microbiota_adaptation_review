"1","wild","Here we surveyed the intestinal microbiota of 68 wild-type zebrafish, with functional adaptive immunity, and 61 rag1− zebrafish, lacking functional Band T-cell receptors, to test the role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the intestinal microbiota. "
"2","wild","Similar to this current study, Dimitriu et al. (2013) compared the gut microbiota between wild-type and immunocompromised hosts that were either separated by genotype or mixed. "
"3","wild","They found that when genotypes were mixed, wild-type gut communities became more like immunocompromised gut communities, implying that the filtering effects of adaptive immunity can be overwhelmed by migration from other host communities. "
"4","wild","To determine whether adaptive immunity is an important ecological filter of the gut microbiota in the adult zebrafish, we compared the gut bacterial communities of wild-type (adaptive immunity present) and rag1− (adaptive immunity inactive) hosts (Wienholds, 2002). "
"5","wild","(1) Adaptive immunity, due to the somatic recombination of Band T-cell receptors, has an individualizing effect on the gut microbiota of each host, resulting in greater variation in community composition among wild-type hosts than rag1− hosts. "
"6","wild","(2) The filtering effects of adaptive immunity will lead to distinct differences between the composition of wild-type and immune-deficient hosts. "
"7","wild","We therefore created a treatment with either a low or high potential for transmission between wild-type and rag1− hosts by segregating or mixing genotypes, respectively (Figure 1). "
"8","wild","We hypothesized that increasing the potential for transmission between wild-type and rag1− hosts by cohousing genotypes would overwhelm the effects of adaptive immunity, making their communities more similar to rag1− communities, as demonstrated in mice by Dimitriu et al. "
"9","wild","Materials and methods Experimental design and sample collection We crossed two pairs of fish derived from the same line (Wienholds, 2002); one pair were both rag1+ (wild type) and the other pair were both rag1−. "
"10","wild","Using primers specific to various immunoglobulin V segments of the variable region and reverse primers specific to the immunoglobulin M constant regions, we attempted to amplify full-length immunoglobulin M transcripts in wildtype and rag1− samples (one primer pair per reaction). "
"11","wild","We raised nine tanks of 22 fish each, on standard continuous flow in the UO aquatic animal facility: three tanks of only wild-type, three tanks of only rag1− and three tanks with equal numbers of both genotypes. "
"12","wild","At 75 d.p.f., approximately a month after adaptive immunity should have become fully functional in all wild-type fish, all the remaining samples (134) were killed for gut dissection and microbial DNA extraction. "
"13","wild","A subset of the segregated wild-type and rag1− samples were genotyped, via PCR (Wienholds, 2002), to confirm their presumed identity, and all mixed-housing samples were genotyped to determine their identity. "
"14","wild","One of the primers used in the PCR protocol creates a KpnI site in the amplicons from the wild-type allele but not the mutant allele. "
"15","wild","These non-complementary bases can sometimes be edited by the polymerase, thus making wild-type samples appear heterozygous. "
"16","wild","Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests on weighted Unifrac distances were performed using Figure 1 Experimental design for comparison of wild-type and rag1− gut microbiota. "
"17","wild","Different adaptive repertoires could theoretically filter the gut microbiota in different ways within each wild-type host, while other host factors (in a near-isogenic population) should filter the gut microbiota similarly across all hosts. "
"18","wild","We therefore hypothesized that adaptive immunity acts as an individualizing filter, making wild-type hosts more dissimilar, on average, from other wild-type hosts than rag1− hosts would be from each other. "
"19","wild","When we compared the taxonomic similarity of the microbiota (beta-diversity) between hosts of the same genotype across both housing treatments, we indeed found that wild-type hosts had a slightly, but significantly, greater average dissimilarity than rag1− hosts (FHost Genotype =14.41, Po0.001; Figure 2). "
"20","wild","If adaptive immunity were a robust filter, we expected to see no change in its individualizing effect on the wild type and/or an overall decrease in the similarity of wild-type microbiota as they would be exposed to a more diverse pool from which to individually sample from. "
"21","wild","Alternatively, if it were not robust, we expected dispersal from rag1− hosts to make the wild-type hosts more homogenous. "
"22","wild","However, contrary to either of those expectations, both wild-type hosts and rag1− hosts were significantly less homogenous when the genotypes were mixed compared with when each genotype was segregated (Figure 2; FHousing = 51.86, Poo0.001). "
"23","wild","We did find, however, that rag1− and wild-type hosts in mixed housing together had increased phylogenetic diversity (FHousing = 10.18, Po0.01; Figure 3a), an outcome to be expected if two dissimilar communities become connected by dispersal (Mouquet and Loreau, 2002). "
"24","wild","Of particular note, Mycobacterium, a common fish pathogen, was a core genus for all treatments except the segregated wild-type hosts, suggesting a classical role for adaptive immunity in protecting against pathogens in zebrafish at both the individual and population level. "
"25","wild","Adaptive immunity does not significantly filter environmental bacteria We hypothesized that adaptive immunity is an important ecological filter on the gut microbiota, with the result that the gut microbiota of wild-type hosts differ more from the environmental bacterial Figure 3 Phylogenetic alpha-diversity of gut and water communities. "
"26","wild","As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, we found no significant difference in the similarity between gut and water bacterial communities among the wild-type and rag1− hosts. "
"27","wild","A lower fit of the model for the wild-type compared with rag1− hosts in our study would indicate that adaptive immunity increases the strength of filtering between hosts and the source pool of all potential fishassociated microbes and thus support our hypothesis. "
"28","wild","Our analysis revealed that, whether genotypes were segregated or mixed, the fit of the neutral model was lower for wild-type hosts than rag1− hosts (Figure 4). "
"29","wild","We observed that adaptive immunity individualizes the gut microbiota of hosts, that is, hosts lacking adaptive immunity become more similar to each other than wild-type hosts. "
"30","wild","This effect of genotype maintains significance within the segregated housing treatment, but not the mixedhousing treatment, which is consistent with a possible mechanism wherein dispersal from wildtype hosts causes rag1− hosts to become more individualized. "
"31","wild","Our most striking finding of a difference between wild-type and rag1− fish, that the rag1− hosts have greater inter-subject similarity, could be explained Adaptive immunity as an ecological filter K Stagaman et al 1636 The ISME Journal by two possible mechanisms. "
"32","wild","It should be noted that while neutral processes have a more important role in microbiota assembly in rag1− hosts than wild-type hosts, this does not mean that other selective processes are not important, as the model typically explains less than 40% of the variance seen in the taxon distributions.
