"1","wild","Here we surveyed the intestinal microbiota of 68 wild-type zebrafish, with functional adaptive immunity, and 61 rag1− zebrafish, lacking functional Band T-cell receptors, to test the role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the intestinal microbiota. "
"2","wild","Similar to this current study, Dimitriu et al. (2013) compared the gut microbiota between wild-type and immunocompromised hosts that were either separated by genotype or mixed. "
"3","wild","They found that when genotypes were mixed, wild-type gut communities became more like immunocompromised gut communities, implying that the filtering effects of adaptive immunity can be overwhelmed by migration from other host communities. "
"4","wild","To determine whether adaptive immunity is an important ecological filter of the gut microbiota in the adult zebrafish, we compared the gut bacterial communities of wild-type (adaptive immunity present) and rag1− (adaptive immunity inactive) hosts (Wienholds, 2002). "
"5","wild","(1) Adaptive immunity, due to the somatic recombination of Band T-cell receptors, has an individualizing effect on the gut microbiota of each host, resulting in greater variation in community composition among wild-type hosts than rag1− hosts. "
"6","wild","(2) The filtering effects of adaptive immunity will lead to distinct differences between the composition of wild-type and immune-deficient hosts. "
"7","wild","We therefore created a treatment with either a low or high potential for transmission between wild-type and rag1− hosts by segregating or mixing genotypes, respectively (Figure 1). "
"8","wild","We hypothesized that increasing the potential for transmission between wild-type and rag1− hosts by cohousing genotypes would overwhelm the effects of adaptive immunity, making their communities more similar to rag1− communities, as demonstrated in mice by Dimitriu et al. "
"9","wild","Materials and methods Experimental design and sample collection We crossed two pairs of fish derived from the same line (Wienholds, 2002); one pair were both rag1+ (wild type) and the other pair were both rag1−. "
"10","wild","Using primers specific to various immunoglobulin V segments of the variable region and reverse primers specific to the immunoglobulin M constant regions, we attempted to amplify full-length immunoglobulin M transcripts in wildtype and rag1− samples (one primer pair per reaction). "
"11","wild","We raised nine tanks of 22 fish each, on standard continuous flow in the UO aquatic animal facility: three tanks of only wild-type, three tanks of only rag1− and three tanks with equal numbers of both genotypes. "
"12","wild","At 75 d.p.f., approximately a month after adaptive immunity should have become fully functional in all wild-type fish, all the remaining samples (134) were killed for gut dissection and microbial DNA extraction. "
"13","wild","A subset of the segregated wild-type and rag1− samples were genotyped, via PCR (Wienholds, 2002), to confirm their presumed identity, and all mixed-housing samples were genotyped to determine their identity. "
"14","wild","One of the primers used in the PCR protocol creates a KpnI site in the amplicons from the wild-type allele but not the mutant allele. "
"15","wild","These non-complementary bases can sometimes be edited by the polymerase, thus making wild-type samples appear heterozygous. "
"16","wild","Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests on weighted Unifrac distances were performed using Figure 1 Experimental design for comparison of wild-type and rag1− gut microbiota. "
"17","wild","Different adaptive repertoires could theoretically filter the gut microbiota in different ways within each wild-type host, while other host factors (in a near-isogenic population) should filter the gut microbiota similarly across all hosts. "
"18","wild","We therefore hypothesized that adaptive immunity acts as an individualizing filter, making wild-type hosts more dissimilar, on average, from other wild-type hosts than rag1− hosts would be from each other. "
"19","wild","When we compared the taxonomic similarity of the microbiota (beta-diversity) between hosts of the same genotype across both housing treatments, we indeed found that wild-type hosts had a slightly, but significantly, greater average dissimilarity than rag1− hosts (FHost Genotype =14.41, Po0.001; Figure 2). "
"20","wild","If adaptive immunity were a robust filter, we expected to see no change in its individualizing effect on the wild type and/or an overall decrease in the similarity of wild-type microbiota as they would be exposed to a more diverse pool from which to individually sample from. "
"21","wild","Alternatively, if it were not robust, we expected dispersal from rag1− hosts to make the wild-type hosts more homogenous. "
"22","wild","However, contrary to either of those expectations, both wild-type hosts and rag1− hosts were significantly less homogenous when the genotypes were mixed compared with when each genotype was segregated (Figure 2; FHousing = 51.86, Poo0.001). "
"23","wild","We did find, however, that rag1− and wild-type hosts in mixed housing together had increased phylogenetic diversity (FHousing = 10.18, Po0.01; Figure 3a), an outcome to be expected if two dissimilar communities become connected by dispersal (Mouquet and Loreau, 2002). "
"24","wild","Of particular note, Mycobacterium, a common fish pathogen, was a core genus for all treatments except the segregated wild-type hosts, suggesting a classical role for adaptive immunity in protecting against pathogens in zebrafish at both the individual and population level. "
"25","wild","Adaptive immunity does not significantly filter environmental bacteria We hypothesized that adaptive immunity is an important ecological filter on the gut microbiota, with the result that the gut microbiota of wild-type hosts differ more from the environmental bacterial Figure 3 Phylogenetic alpha-diversity of gut and water communities. "
"26","wild","As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, we found no significant difference in the similarity between gut and water bacterial communities among the wild-type and rag1− hosts. "
"27","wild","A lower fit of the model for the wild-type compared with rag1− hosts in our study would indicate that adaptive immunity increases the strength of filtering between hosts and the source pool of all potential fishassociated microbes and thus support our hypothesis. "
"28","wild","Our analysis revealed that, whether genotypes were segregated or mixed, the fit of the neutral model was lower for wild-type hosts than rag1− hosts (Figure 4). "
"29","wild","We observed that adaptive immunity individualizes the gut microbiota of hosts, that is, hosts lacking adaptive immunity become more similar to each other than wild-type hosts. "
"30","wild","This effect of genotype maintains significance within the segregated housing treatment, but not the mixedhousing treatment, which is consistent with a possible mechanism wherein dispersal from wildtype hosts causes rag1− hosts to become more individualized. "
"31","wild","Our most striking finding of a difference between wild-type and rag1− fish, that the rag1− hosts have greater inter-subject similarity, could be explained Adaptive immunity as an ecological filter K Stagaman et al 1636 The ISME Journal by two possible mechanisms. "
"32","wild","It should be noted that while neutral processes have a more important role in microbiota assembly in rag1− hosts than wild-type hosts, this does not mean that other selective processes are not important, as the model typically explains less than 40% of the variance seen in the taxon distributions. "
"33","mutant","We previously confirmed the lack of mature Adaptive immunity as an ecological filter K Stagaman et al 1631 The ISME Journal immunoglobulin production in the rag1− mutants via PCR. "
"34","mutant","One of the primers used in the PCR protocol creates a KpnI site in the amplicons from the wild-type allele but not the mutant allele. "
"35","mutant","The role of the adaptive immune system as an ecological filter is further supported by the increased fit of a neutral assembly model to the gut microbiota of rag1− mutant hosts. "
"36","mutant","Rag1− /− mutant zebrafish demonstrate specific protection following bacterial re-exposure. "
"37","model","An emerging conceptual model for this role is that of an ‘ecological filter’. "
"38","model","There is a growing body of evidence that the immune system can act as an ecological filter of the microbiota in humans and animal models. "
"39","model","The zebrafish is an excellent model for testing the filtering effect of adaptive immunity because many of the shortcomings of mouse and human studies can be simultaneously addressed. "
"40","model","In addition, we inferred the relative roles of neutral and selective processes in shaping the zebrafish gut microbiota over development, by fitting the data to an ecological model that assumes only neutral community assembly processes (such as dispersal and stochastic loss of individuals). "
"41","model","We previously reported a trend of decreasing neutral model fit across development, implying that ecological filters become more important in shaping the gut microbiota as the zebrafish develops (Burns et al., 2016). "
"42","model","To better understand the ecological processes involved in ecological filtering via the host adaptive immune system, we fit our microbiota data to an ecological model that assumes only neutral community assembly processes (such as dispersal and stochastic gain and loss of individuals). "
"43","model","The model predicts that taxa with a high abundance in a source pool of potential bacterial colonists will be found in a greater fraction of those hosts because, being more abundant, they are more likely to disperse by chance, while taxa of low average abundance are more likely to be lost from individual hosts due to stochastic processes and a lower likelihood of random dispersal. "
"44","model","We inferred poor model fits to be indicative of non-neutral processes, such as host filtering, being important in distinguishing genotypes and housing treatments from one another. "
"45","model","Because model fit can be influenced by the number of samples in each treatment, we ran the model on multiple subsets of samples of each treatment. "
"46","model","Taxa whose frequency of occurrence across fish were inconsistent with the neutral model, falling outside the 95% confidence interval of the model prediction, were inferred to be subject to host filtering. "
"47","model","Using these cutoffs from the model, we partitioned communities into taxa with neutral and non-neutral distributions and determined whether the composition of these partitions differed by host genotype and housing conditions. "
"48","model","Adaptive immunity increases the role of selective processes in assembly of the gut microbiota To further investigate the role of adaptive immunity, we used a neutral model to ask whether the presence of adaptive immunity increases the degree of filtering among hosts of each genotype. "
"49","model","For each genotype, we asked whether a neutral model could predict the distribution of microbial taxa across hosts by the average abundance of those taxa across hosts of all genotypes and housing treatments (see Supplementary Figure S4A for an example of the analysis). "
"50","model","We previously documented a decrease in the fit of a neutral model for distributions of zebrafish gut microbiota members through developmental time, including time after the onset of adaptive immunity (Burns et al., 2016). "
"51","model","We therefore hypothesized that the presence of adaptive immunity, acting as an ecological filter, is one of the host factors contributing to the reduced model fit to the distributions of gut microbial taxa. "
"52","model","A lower fit of the model for the wild-type compared with rag1− hosts in our study would indicate that adaptive immunity increases the strength of filtering between hosts and the source pool of all potential fishassociated microbes and thus support our hypothesis. "
"53","model","Our analysis revealed that, whether genotypes were segregated or mixed, the fit of the neutral model was lower for wild-type hosts than rag1− hosts (Figure 4). "

"
"55","model","Adaptive immunity as an ecological filter K Stagaman et al 1635 The ISME Journal genotypes appears to increase slightly from the model fits for both segregated genotypes. "
"56","model","We further investigated the neutral model to determine whether there were differences in the subsets of taxa whose distributions deviated from the expectation of the neutral model. "
"57","model","The neutral model analysis can be used to assign each taxon into a ‘neutral’ or ‘non-neutral’ partition based on its distribution (Supplementary Figure S4A). "
"58","model","We endeavored to rigorously examine adaptive immunity’s filtering effects utilizing the zebrafish gut microbiota as a model. "
"59","model","To test these two hypotheses, we applied a neutral model to the distribution of bacterial taxa in our data and assessed its fit. "
"60","model","Our finding that the neutral model has a greater fit to rag1− gut community distributions in both housing treatments suggests the latter hypothesis: the absence of the adaptive immune system removes the ability of hosts to filter their gut microbiota. "
"61","model","It should be noted that while neutral processes have a more important role in microbiota assembly in rag1− hosts than wild-type hosts, this does not mean that other selective processes are not important, as the model typically explains less than 40% of the variance seen in the taxon distributions.
