"9","adaptation","Early mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle to diet-induced obesity are strain dependent and determine oxidative stress and energy expenditure but not insulin sensitivity. "
"10","mutant","Foucaud-Vignault et al. (47) reported that another PGP mutant strain, Mdr1ab2/2 mice (lacking both Mdr1a and 1b), develop obesity and abnormal glucose metabolism with age compared with WT mice when fed either a LFD or HFD. "
"11","inbred","Hyperand hypo-responsiveness to dietary fat and cholesterol among inbred mice: searching for level and variability genes. "
"12","model","Obese animals and humans have increased levels of both systemic (serum IL-6 and TNFa) and localized (liver and adipose) inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (2–4), similar to increases in proinflammatory molecules in animal models of IBD as well as patients with Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (5–10). "
"13","model","To explore this association, we examined whether an obesity-inducing high-fat diet (HFD) could also accelerate IBD development and progression using a genetically susceptible mouse model of IBD, Mdr1a2/2mice. "
"14","model","The onset of IBD in this model is associated with the presence of commensal bacteria and thus can be prevented by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics in mice housed in specific pathogen-free facilities (7,20)."
"15","model","Our studies were designed to address whether dietinduced obesity increases the risk of spontaneous IBD in this murine model. "

"17","model","Leptin also has been shown to have a proinflammatory role in animal models of colitis (8,35). "
"18","model","Other animal models are consistent with this notion. "
"19","model","Using a Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis model in C57BL/6 mice, Teixeira et al. (42) suggested that a HFD-induced obesity exacerbated IBD and increased immune cell infiltration in adipose tissues. "
"20","model","If animals did not gain substantial weight, then one might suggest that a HFD itself may contribute to exacerbation of IBD in this model. "
"21","model","Because a HFD is a cause of obesity in our animal model, we are not able to separate the contribution of obesity from the HFD in the development or exacerbation of IBD. "
"22","model","Obesity and inflammation in regional adipose tissue may play a role in IBD pathogenesis, and animal models may be useful to dissect any association. "
"23","model","We found that HFD-induced obesity significantly increased the severity of IBD in the genetically susceptible Mdr1a2/2 mouse model. "
