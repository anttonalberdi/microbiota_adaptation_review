"12","model","Obese animals and humans have increased levels of both systemic (serum IL-6 and TNFa) and localized (liver and adipose) inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (2–4), similar to increases in proinflammatory molecules in animal models of IBD as well as patients with Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (5–10). "
"13","model","To explore this association, we examined whether an obesity-inducing high-fat diet (HFD) could also accelerate IBD development and progression using a genetically susceptible mouse model of IBD, Mdr1a2/2mice. "
"14","model","The onset of IBD in this model is associated with the presence of commensal bacteria and thus can be prevented by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics in mice housed in specific pathogen-free facilities (7,20)."

"18","model","Other animal models are consistent with this notion. "
"19","model","Using a Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis model in C57BL/6 mice, Teixeira et al. (42) suggested that a HFD-induced obesity exacerbated IBD and increased immune cell infiltration in adipose tissues. "
"20","model","If animals did not gain substantial weight, then one might suggest that a HFD itself may contribute to exacerbation of IBD in this model. "
"21","model","Because a HFD is a cause of obesity in our animal model, we are not able to separate the contribution of obesity from the HFD in the development or exacerbation of IBD. "
"22","model","Obesity and inflammation in regional adipose tissue may play a role in IBD pathogenesis, and animal models may be useful to dissect any association. "
