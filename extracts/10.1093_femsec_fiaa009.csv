"1","wild","This is often studied in laboratory-reared hosts but rarely in individuals whose microbiota looks like that of wild animals. "
"2","wild","In the case of insect hosts, pathogens in their microbial environment are often studied in laboratory-reared hosts but rarely in individuals whose microbiota looks like that of wild animals. "
"3","wild","2008; Wang and Rozen 2017) both sampled from the wild and reared on a natural diet, also have microbiota dominated by Pseudomonas sp., the Enterobacter group and Serratia sp.. "
"4","wild","These findings show that our protocol can be used to obtain insects with a diversified microbiota, closer to that of wild insects than to that of laboratory-reared insect. "

"6","model","2 INTRODUCTION In the particular context of host–pathogen interactions, it has recently been shown that the host microbiota may have a positive or a negative impact on pathogens, potentially altering the outcome of infection in different model hosts (Stecher and Hardt 2008; Caccia et al. "
"7","model","This diversity may be responsible for interaction with the pathogen different from what is usually observed in laboratory models. "
"8","model","A first model was adjusted on the complete dataset, with the explanatory variables being infection (i.e. infected versus wounded insects), and site (CDS versus MTF) and the interaction between infection and site. "
"9","model","A second model was adjusted on data for infected insects only, with the explanatory variables being nematode-bacterium pair (i.e. "
"10","model","The insects began to die 2 days after infestation and all infected insects died within 10 days for the Sc-Xn and Sf-Xb treatments, whereas mortality was significantly lower (63%, 10 days after infection) for insects infected with Sw-Xb (Table 2, binomial generalized linar model (GLM), df = 2, P-value = 2.1e-05).
