"6","model","2 INTRODUCTION In the particular context of host–pathogen interactions, it has recently been shown that the host microbiota may have a positive or a negative impact on pathogens, potentially altering the outcome of infection in different model hosts (Stecher and Hardt 2008; Caccia et al. "
"7","model","This diversity may be responsible for interaction with the pathogen different from what is usually observed in laboratory models. "
"8","model","A first model was adjusted on the complete dataset, with the explanatory variables being infection (i.e. infected versus wounded insects), and site (CDS versus MTF) and the interaction between infection and site. "
"9","model","A second model was adjusted on data for infected insects only, with the explanatory variables being nematode-bacterium pair (i.e. "
"10","model","The insects began to die 2 days after infestation and all infected insects died within 10 days for the Sc-Xn and Sf-Xb treatments, whereas mortality was significantly lower (63%, 10 days after infection) for insects infected with Sw-Xb (Table 2, binomial generalized linar model (GLM), df = 2, P-value = 2.1e-05).

"15","environment","In the case of insect hosts, pathogens in their microbial environment are often studied in laboratory-reared hosts but rarely in individuals whose microbiota looks like that of wild animals. "

"20","laboratory","We showed by high throughput sequencing methods that this treatment modifies the gut microbiota so that it is more diversified than that of laboratory-reared insects, and closely resembled the one of soil-dwelling insects. "
"21","laboratory","In the case of insect hosts, pathogens in their microbial environment are often studied in laboratory-reared hosts but rarely in individuals whose microbiota looks like that of wild animals. "
"22","laboratory","However, insects living in the natural environment have a microbiota much more diverse than that of laboratory-reared insects (Chandler et al. "
"23","laboratory","This diversity may be responsible for interaction with the pathogen different from what is usually observed in laboratory models. "
"24","laboratory","Studies of different nematode–bacterium pairs, with laboratory-reared lepidopteran hosts (Galleria and Manduca) have shown that Xenorhabdus spp. dominates the bacterial community within the insect cadaver 48 hours after infection (Gouge and Snyder 2006; Singh et al. 2014), but that it coexists with other bacteria several days after the death of the host (Isaacson and Webster 2002; Walsh and Webster 2003). "
"25","laboratory","Other studies have demonstrated that nematodes of the genus Steinernema, although historically considered monoxenic, can associate with bacteria other than Xenorhabdus, at least in laboratory (Walsh and Webster 2003; Gouge and Snyder 2006). "
"26","laboratory","All nematode strains had been kept for several years in the laboratory, with reamplification through the infection of Galleria mellonella larvae, and were stored in Ringer solution at 8◦C. "
"27","laboratory","Rearing of insects in soil samples We produced hosts with a microbiota as close as possible to the naturally occurring microbiota while controlling for other insect characteristics, by acclimating laboratory-reared T. molitor to soil samples. "
"28","laboratory","We maintained laboratory-reared T. molitor larvae for a few days in either sterilized bran or sterilized bran mixed with soil samples. "
"29","laboratory","Bran-reared and soil-reared T. molitor larvae are sensitive to Steinernema nematodes at a suboptimal temperature In the laboratory, experiments involving entomopathogenic nematodes are usually performed at a temperature allowing optimal insect infection and nematodes reproduction (e.g. "
"30","laboratory","In this study, we reduced the temperature of incubation to 18◦C to be closer to natural conditions (8 to 10◦C in our soil at the time of soil sampling) while staying in the range of temperatures compatible with significant mortality in laboratory (Grewal, Selvan and Gaugler 1994; Saunders and Webster 1999). "
"31","laboratory","Conversely to what it is extensively described in infestation of laboratoryreared Lepidopteran insects by Steinernema (Isaacson and Webster 2002; Walsh and Webster 2003; Singh et al. "
"32","laboratory","DISCUSSION Gut microbiota communities of laboratory-reared insects, which are usually maintained on very simple media and diets, are dominated by one or two bacterial strains: Pseudomonas in our study, Enterococcus in moths (Chen et al. "
