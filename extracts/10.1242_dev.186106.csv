"1","wild","In a wild-type midgut, L. brevis activates growth regulatory pathways that drive stem cell divisions. "
"2","wild","To understand how gut bacteria regulate epithelial proliferation, we determined the impacts of common fly commensals on wild-type and Notch-deficient progenitors. "
"3","wild","(B) Images of wild-type CR esgts/+ intestines. "
"4","wild","Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that Notch-deficient progenitors segregate from wild-type progenitors along PC1, regardless of bacterial association (Fig. "
"5","wild","For Lb and Lp, we observed significantly increased bacterial loads in Notch-deficient intestines compared with wild-type controls (Fig. "
"6","wild","As bacterial association is higher in Notch-deficient intestines than in wild-type intestines (Fig. "
"7","wild","Consistent with a role for IMD in the control of intestinal Lb, we found that imd mutants had significantly higher Lb loads than did wild-type controls 10 days after mono-association with Lb (Fig. "
"8","wild","In wild-type esgts/+ intestines, the rates of increase in host-association with Lp and Lb are nearly indistinguishable, with Lb associating to lower levels at all times tested (Fig. "
"9","wild","4D), than wild-type intestines (0.97 days; Fig. "
"10","wild","(B) CFU of Lb per fly intestine 10 days after transgene expression/bacterial colonization in Lb monoassociated wild type (w1118), imd−/− and Myo1Ats;ImdCA. n=6 intestines per genotype. "
"11","wild","PCA and differential expression analysis identified a transcriptional response that is unique to Lb in wild-type and Notch-deficient progenitors (Fig. "
"12","wild","Given the positive effects of Lb on expression of ISC division regulators in esgts/+ and esgts/NRNAi progenitors, we asked if Lb activates ISC division in wild-type progenitors. "
"13","wild","To answer this question, we mono-associated GF wild-type (esgts/+) flies with Lb and quantified phospho-histone 3-positive (PH3+) mitotic cells in adult midguts. "
"14","wild","Similar to the effects on tumors, Lb stimulated division of wild-type progenitors to significantly higher levels than those of CR, GF or Lp-mono-associated flies (Fig. "
"15","wild","Thus, our data indicate that association with Lb diminishes the expression of genes required for progenitor adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and induces expression of genes required for epithelial growth, promoting ISC division in wild-type and Notch-deficient progenitors. "
"16","wild","In a preliminary experiment, we used transmission electron microscopy to visualize posterior midguts of CR and Lb-associated wild-type flies. "
"17","wild","However, as individual stem cell lineages accumulate mutations with age, we consider it possible that exposure to Lb also facilitates spontaneous development of intestinal tumors in wild-type adult flies. "
"18","wild","In parallel with or downstream of epithelial stress, Lb decreases integrin expression in ISCs, promoting symmetric stem cell divisions that expand the numbers of stem cells and increase the regenerative capacity of the wild-type intestine as a mechanism of adaptive growth. "
"19","wild","The imd andUAS-ImdCA lines had been backcrossed into our wild-type w1118 background. "
"20","wild","Microbial community assembly in wild populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. "
"21","fitness","Microbiome interactions shape host fitness. "
