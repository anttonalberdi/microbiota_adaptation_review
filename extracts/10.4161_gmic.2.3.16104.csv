"
"43","disease","In this way, bacteria capable of adapting to these conditions could benefit from the disease.6 One factor possibly affecting the gut microbiota in the inflamed intestine is an impaired metabolism of neutral sterols and bile acids (BAs), which is a common clinical feature of IBD.7,8 BAs exert antimicrobial effects by damaging the cytoplasmic membrane or the DNA, or by inducing oxidative stress9-11 and preferentially inhibit the growth of strict anaerobes.12,13 However, the ability to transform BAs is widespread among commensal gut bacteria.14 We therefore hypothesized that the steroid metabolism is impaired under chronic gut inflammation and that the resulting higher BA concentrations influence gut microbiota composition by stimulating BA-resistant and/or inhibiting BA-susceptible bacterial species. "
"44","disease","In these animals, a lower intestinal abundance of phylotypes belonging to the Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae was strongly associated with a decreased disease activity.18 We hypothesized that these changes in gut microbiota composition might be associated with an impaired intestinal steroid metabolism since a high fecal excretion of neutral sterols and low sterol plasma levels have been reported in IBD patients.19,20 Figure 2.
