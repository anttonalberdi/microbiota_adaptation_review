"1","wild","The microbiota in the inflamed gut of these mice is less diverse than in the healthy wild-type controls and dominated by only a few bacterial species including Escherichia coli and Blautia producta. "
"2","wild","Healthy wild-type mice served as controls. "
"3","wild","To find experimental support for this hypothesis, we measured intestinal steroid concentrations in 24-week-old IL-10-/mice with chronic gut inflammation and in healthy wildtype animals. "
"4","wild","However, proportions were always lower in the wild-type mice (data not shown). "
"5","wild","Since the fecal dry matter between IL-10-/and wild-type mice differed significantly, neutral sterol concentrations were also calculated based on fecal wet weight. "
