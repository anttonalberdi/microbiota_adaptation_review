"1","wild","In contrast, hepatic CYP1A1 was moderately induced in TLR2deficient mice without restoring their ability to clear BaP from systemic circulation, as present in wild-type animals. "
"2","wild","After feeding of BaP for 21 days, only TLR22/2 mice, but not their wild type littermates developed polyps in the colon. "
"3","wild","In an initial experiment, we identified the basal expression of CYP1A1 to be dramatically reduced in the intestine of TLR22/2 mice compared to wild-type (WT) animals with the corresponding genetic background. "
"4","wild","Mice of each genotype (wild-type and TLR2tm1Kir/J, 30 in total) were divided into two groups (7â€“8 animals/group), one of them receiving BaP. "
"5","wild","The fold-changes reported are ratios of the averages calculated for the wild-type and TLR22/2 animals. "
"6","wild","Results In the first experiment, differences in gene expression in the intestines between mice that were deficient for functional TLR2 protein and wild type (WT) animals were measured with Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays. "
"7","wild","In the consequent intervention study, we investigated whether feeding with BaP induces expression of intestinal mRNAs for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 as well as concentrations of CYP 1A1/CYP1A2 protein in TLR22/2 mice and in wild-type animals. "
"8","wild","Relative gene expressions in the intestine of TLR2-deficient that are changed at least 4-fold compared to wild-type mice. "
