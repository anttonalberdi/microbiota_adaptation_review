"1","wild","Nod2-deficient (Nod2e/e) mice had an inherently altered skin microbiome compared with wild-type controls. "
"2","wild","Furthermore, we found that Nod2e/e skin microbiome dominated and caused impaired healing, shown in cross-fostering experiments of wild-type pups with Nod2e/e pups, which then acquired altered cutaneous bacteria and delayed healing. "
"3","wild","To confirm whether Pseudomonas species directly impair wound healing, wild-type mice were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and, akin to Nod2e/e mice, were found to exhibit a significant delay in wound repair. "
