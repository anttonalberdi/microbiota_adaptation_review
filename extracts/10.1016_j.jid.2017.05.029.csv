"1","wild","Nod2-deficient (Nod2e/e) mice had an inherently altered skin microbiome compared with wild-type controls. "
"2","wild","Furthermore, we found that Nod2e/e skin microbiome dominated and caused impaired healing, shown in cross-fostering experiments of wild-type pups with Nod2e/e pups, which then acquired altered cutaneous bacteria and delayed healing. "
"3","wild","To confirm whether Pseudomonas species directly impair wound healing, wild-type mice were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and, akin to Nod2e/e mice, were found to exhibit a significant delay in wound repair. "

"17","disease","NOD2 is implicated in changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in Crohn’s disease, but its role on skin microbiota is unknown. "
"18","disease","Recent methodological advances in high-throughput sequencing have shown the complexity of microorganisms associated with skin (Grice et al., 2009; NIH HMP Working Group et al., 2009) and have begun to directly implicate a microbial imbalance, a socalled dysbiosis, in skin health and disease (Achermann et al., 2014). "
"19","disease","Mutations in the leucinerich region of the NOD2/CARD15 gene are associated with the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory diseases of barrier organs including Crohn’s disease (Lesage et al., 2002), asthma (Wong et al., 2015), and Blau syndrome (Kurokawa et al., 2003). "
"20","disease","Studies in Crohn’s disease patients and Nod2-deficient mice showed reduced a-defensin expression in the intestinal mucosa (Eckmann and Karin, 2005; Maeda et al., 2005). "
"21","disease","DISCUSSION A wealth of literature has characterized the role of the host response in regulating gut microbiome, with wide-ranging implications for normal physiology and diseaseJournal of Investigative Dermatology (2017), Volume 137(Perez-Chanona et al., 2014; Philpott et al., 2014). "
"22","disease","A growing body of literature links NOD2/CARD15 polymorphisms with a dysregulated innate immune response and susceptibility to diseases, including Crohn’s disease (Lesage et al., 2002), Blau syndrome (Kurokawa et al., 2003), earlyonset sarcoidosis (Kapral, 1966), and graft-versus-host disease (Hoebe et al., 2005). "
"23","disease","Studies in patients with Crohn’s disease and Nod2-deficient mice showed that intestinal changes in bacterial composition are associated with altered a-defensin expression in the intestinal mucosa (Philpott et al., 2014). a-Defensins are not expressed in skin; however, the cutaneous effects of NOD2 are associated with altered b-defensins, yet the exact role these AMPs are playing in our Nod2-null mice remain to be elucidated. "
"24","disease","Changes in skin b-defensins have previously been linked to skin infection (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) (Zanger et al., 2010) and skin disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis) (Ong et al., 2002). "
"25","disease","For example, unaffected relatives of Crohn’s disease patients reportedly share some features of the disease-associated microbiome composition (Joossens et al., 2011). "
"26","disease","Fecal transplant, also referred to as gut microbiome transplant, a procedure in which fecal bacteria from a healthy donor are transplanted into a patient, has shown promise in the treatment of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (Young, 2016). "

"37","environment","When focusing on specific skin microbiota at the phylum level, again using the Shannon-Wiener index, there was a significant change in the diversity of Bacteroidetes species between environment: separately housed WT versus separately housed Nod2e/e and separately housed Nod2e/e versus the co-housed mice (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) (Figure 5c). "
