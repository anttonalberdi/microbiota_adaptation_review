"1","wild","Adult male wild-type C57BL-6 mice were fed a standard diet or HFD, supplemented with either placebo or the bifidobacterial strain for 13 weeks. "
"2","wild","Animals, Diets, and Experimental Design Adult (age 6–8 weeks) male wild-type C57BL-6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (L’Arbresle Cedex, France). "

"4","adaptation","During the adaptation period (7 days), each animal was housed in a stainless-steel cage in a temperaturecontrolled (23 °C) room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and 40– 50% relative humidity. "
"5","adaptation","To induce obesity in two of the experimental groups, mice were switched from the SD (CA.170481— AIN-76A Purified Diet-Rats/Mice, Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI 53744-4220), administered during the adaptation period, to a HFD (TD.06414—Adjusted Calories Diet— 60/Fat, Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI 53744-4220) for 14 weeks. "

"7","adaptation","De Kloet ER, Joels M, Holsboer F (2005) Stress and the brain: from adaptation to disease. "
"8","model","Experimental models of diet-induced obesity have revealed that obese animals are prone to anxious and depressive-like behaviors. "
"9","model","The present study aimed to evaluate whether Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 could reverse the neurobehavioral consequences of obesity in a highfat diet (HFD) fed mouse model via regulation of the gut– brain axis. "
"10","model","The gut–brain axis is also a route for the gut microbiota to impact on brain function as demonstrated in experimental models of stress and mood disorders [16, 17]. "
"11","model","Studies in rodent models of stress also suggest that Bifidobacterium strains act as protective dietary factors, mainly in childhood rather than in adulthood [24]. "
"12","model","The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 in the adverse endocrine and neurobehavioral consequences of obesity in adulthood using a HFD-induced obese mouse model. "
"13","model","This strain was selected for this study owing to its pre-clinical efficacy on metabolic and immune dysfunction in the same obesity model [25–27]. "
"14","model","Methods and Materials Bacterial Strain and Culture Conditions B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 was isolated from healthy infants and identified by sequencing the amplified 16S rRNA gene, as previously described, and selected on the basis of its anti-inflammatory properties in a macrophage cell line [27], in animal models of obesity and cirrhosis [25–28], and in macrophages of cirrhotic patients [29]. "
"15","model","Acute Immobilization Stress Physical immobilization was used as a model of acute stress as previously described [36]. "
"16","model","Acute Social Stress We used the resident-intruder model to induce social stress [37] in our experimental mice. "
"17","model","The present study focused on this bacterial strain because it was previously demonstrated to be able to reduce the obesity-associated metabolic and immune alterations in a diet-induced obesity model [25] and the adverse consequences of chronic psychological stress in the maternal separation mouse model [48]. "
"18","model","This phenotype of metabolic depression could theoretically be represented by our study model of obesity, in which a significant increase of leptin and the inflammatory tone was accompanied by anhedoniclike behavior. "
"19","model","Yang et al. [15] also reported that decreased OB-R expression in the hippocampus correlated to a depressive/anxiety-like behavior in an animal model of obesity and chronic stress. "
"20","model","In turn, neuronal loss could be causally related to reduced OB-R protein expression and downregulation of leptin/LepRb signaling, leading to a depressive-like behavior as reported in a model of obesity and chronic mild stress [15]. "
"21","model","In other study models, chronic stress conditions have been shown to downregulate this receptor [72]. "
