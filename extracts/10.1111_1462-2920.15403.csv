"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","My early scientific career focused on applying phylogenetic and genomic approaches to characterize ‘wild’ bacteria, archaea and viruses in their natural habitats, with an emphasis on marine systems. "
"2","wild","It was clear that the quest to further characterize ‘wild’ microbial assemblages was worth pursuing since there was still so much left to learn. "
"3","adaptation","This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. "
"4","adaptation","We found that these piezophilic bacteria displayed a type of ‘homeoviscous adaptation’ in their membrane lipids, presumably counteracting the membrane-solidifying effects of elevated hydrostatic pressures of the deep sea (DeLong and Yayanos, 1985). "
"5","adaptation","We also found that many piezophilic isolates biosynthesized large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and incorporated them into their membrane lipids, yet another adaptation to deep-sea lowtemperature and high-pressure (DeLong and Yayanos, 1986). "
"6","mutant","Bottom, knockout mutants in proteorhodopsin photosystem genes and their phenotypes (Martinez et al., 2007). "
"7","mutant","To further investigate the pathways of phosphonate degradation, Chon used large-insert clone libraries from bacterioplankton, to complement E. coli deletion mutants in the C-P lyase pathway that were unable to use phosphonates. "
"8","model","New omic technologies, coupled with more quantitative environmental sampling and measurement techniques at nested scaled, will facilitate simultaneous observations of microbial community genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome dynamics, to improve theory and modelling of complex microbial community system dynamics. "
"9","knockout","She performed knockout mutations demonstrating the function of each gene and showed that just these seven photosystem proteins were necessary and sufficient to enable light-driven photophosphorylation in E. coli (Fig. "
"10","knockout","Bottom, knockout mutants in proteorhodopsin photosystem genes and their phenotypes (Martinez et al., 2007). "
