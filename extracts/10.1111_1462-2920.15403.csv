"1","wild","My early scientific career focused on applying phylogenetic and genomic approaches to characterize ‘wild’ bacteria, archaea and viruses in their natural habitats, with an emphasis on marine systems. "
"2","wild","It was clear that the quest to further characterize ‘wild’ microbial assemblages was worth pursuing since there was still so much left to learn. "

"
"4","adaptation","We found that these piezophilic bacteria displayed a type of ‘homeoviscous adaptation’ in their membrane lipids, presumably counteracting the membrane-solidifying effects of elevated hydrostatic pressures of the deep sea (DeLong and Yayanos, 1985). "
"5","adaptation","We also found that many piezophilic isolates biosynthesized large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and incorporated them into their membrane lipids, yet another adaptation to deep-sea lowtemperature and high-pressure (DeLong and Yayanos, 1986). "
