"1","wild","My early scientific career focused on applying phylogenetic and genomic approaches to characterize ‘wild’ bacteria, archaea and viruses in their natural habitats, with an emphasis on marine systems. "
"2","wild","It was clear that the quest to further characterize ‘wild’ microbial assemblages was worth pursuing since there was still so much left to learn. "

"4","adaptat","We found that these piezophilic bacteria displayed a type of ‘homeoviscous adaptation’ in their membrane lipids, presumably counteracting the membrane-solidifying effects of elevated hydrostatic pressures of the deep sea (DeLong and Yayanos, 1985). "
"5","adaptat","We also found that many piezophilic isolates biosynthesized large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and incorporated them into their membrane lipids, yet another adaptation to deep-sea lowtemperature and high-pressure (DeLong and Yayanos, 1986). "
"6","mutant","Bottom, knockout mutants in proteorhodopsin photosystem genes and their phenotypes (Martinez et al., 2007). "
"7","mutant","To further investigate the pathways of phosphonate degradation, Chon used large-insert clone libraries from bacterioplankton, to complement E. coli deletion mutants in the C-P lyase pathway that were unable to use phosphonates. "
"8","model","New omic technologies, coupled with more quantitative environmental sampling and measurement techniques at nested scaled, will facilitate simultaneous observations of microbial community genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome dynamics, to improve theory and modelling of complex microbial community system dynamics. "
"9","knockout","She performed knockout mutations demonstrating the function of each gene and showed that just these seven photosystem proteins were necessary and sufficient to enable light-driven photophosphorylation in E. coli (Fig. "
"10","knockout","Bottom, knockout mutants in proteorhodopsin photosystem genes and their phenotypes (Martinez et al., 2007). "
"11","environment","These were exciting times in environmental microbiology and microbial ecology, during which many discoveries were enabled by technological improvements in PCR, gene cloning, DNA sequencing and stable isotope approaches. "
"12","environment","But when I set out to find putative methanogenic Archaea within marine snow particles collected in coastal environments (Fig. "
"13","environment","Another major focus for us in those years was the development of environmental genomic approaches (a.k.a. eco-genomics or metagenomics) to better dissect and infer the biochemical and physiological properties of yet-uncultivated microbes. "
"14","environment","It was known that in the marine environment, biogenic phosphonates might be important sources of the limiting nutrient phosphorus. "
"15","environment","Nitrosopumilaceae) in the environment (Hallam et al., 2006b). "
"16","environment","The newfound ability to measure environmental parameters synoptically with massively parallel queries of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes (and to a lesser extent, metaproteomes and metabolomes) quickly enabled the advancement of new systems biology-like approaches in the marine environment (DeLong, 2002a; DeLong, 2002b; DeLong, 2009). "
"17","environment","Leveraging such all-taxon dynamic surveys across nested scales of space and time will undoubtedly provide more detailed four-dimensional perspectives so necessary to understand the interplay of environmental, evolutionary and ecological forces that shape ecosystems. "
"18","environment","New omic technologies, coupled with more quantitative environmental sampling and measurement techniques at nested scaled, will facilitate simultaneous observations of microbial community genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome dynamics, to improve theory and modelling of complex microbial community system dynamics. "
"19","environment","DeLong Over the course of my own career old certainties like ‘PUFAs are not biosynthesized by bacteria’, ‘Archaea only inhabit extreme environments.’, ‘Nitrification is performed only by a few bacterial groups.’, ‘Non-chlorophyll containing bacterioplankton are either strictly heterotrophic or chemolithotrophic’ have all fallen the wayside. "

"23","human","The human gut microbiome also exhibits similar diurnal oscillations, in response to host circadian rhythms and feeding activities, that may provide feed backs to the metabolic homeostatisis of the whole human hostmicrobiome system (Thaiss et al., 2014; Thaiss et al., 2015). "

"25","human","(1996) Construction and characterization of a human bacterial artificial chromosome library. "
"26","laboratory","The problem then (and still today) was that only a small fraction of naturally occurring microbial species could be readily isolated and studied in pure culture in the laboratory. "
