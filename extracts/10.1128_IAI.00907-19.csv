"1","wild","The results showed that LuxS was not found in the luxS gene mutant strain, and this gene deletion decreased E. piscicida growth compared to that of the wild-type strain. "
"2","wild","Meanwhile, the wild-type strain significantly increased penetration and motility in mucin compared to levels with the oluxS strain. "
"3","wild","The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the E. piscicida oluxS strain for zebrafish was significantly higher than that of the wild-type strain, which suggested that the luxS gene deletion could attenuate the strain’s virulence. "
"4","wild","Transcriptome results demonstrated that between cells infected with the oluxS strain and those infected with the wild-type strain 46 genes were significantly differentially regulated, which included 34 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes. "
"5","wild","The wild-type strain E. piscicida EIB202 and the mutant ΔluxS strain appeared as characteristic transparent colonies with black centers on deoxycholate-hydrogen sulfide-lactose (DHL) agar, reflecting hydrogen sulfide production, and had the same semitransparent off-white colonies on tryptic soy broth (TSB) agar. "
"6","wild","Lane 1, the wild-type strain EIB202; lane 2: the mutant ΔluxS strain; lane M, DNA marker DL5000. "
"7","wild","The results showed the amounts of LuxS detected in the wild-type strain EIB202; however, there was no LuxS production in the mutant ΔluxS strain. "
"8","wild","We simulated motility through mucin and compared the wild-type E. piscicida EIB202 and E. piscicida ΔluxS strains using a mucin column incubated at 28°C. "
"9","wild","When we compared the bacterial counts at each fraction of the mucin column, wild-type E. piscicida EIB202 counts were significantly higher between fractions 4 and 9 than those of E. piscicida ΔluxS (Fig. "
"10","wild","In addition, counts of wild-type E. piscicida EIB202 were significantly higher than those of E. piscicida ΔluxS during the whole observation period. "
"11","wild","AI-2 activities were measured in the BB152 luxS gene mutant, the oluxS strain, and the wild-type strain E. piscicida EIB202 by bioluminescence assay using the V. harveyi BB170 strain. "
"12","wild","As shown in Fig. 4, the AI-2 activities of the wild-type strain E. piscicida EIB202 were significantly increased compared to those of the luxS gene mutant strain. "
"13","wild","To investigate the differences in biofilm formation among the wild-type strain EIB202, the oluxS mutant strain, and the oluxS strain treated with supernatant of EIB202 under the same culture conditions, biofilm formation was quantitatively analyzed using a microtiter plate assay at different time points (Fig. "
"14","wild","However, after 6 h of cultivation, a significant difference in biofilm formation was found between the wild-type strain EIB202 and the oluxS strain treated with supernatant of EIB202; the same significant difference was observed between theoluxS strain treated with supernatant of EIB202 and theoluxS strain.

"
"16","wild","Sterile supernatant was added at 10% to overnight cultures of the wild-type strain E. piscicida EIB202 at the beginning of culture. "
"17","wild","In addition, this study found that the growth characteristics of the examined strains, the wild-type and the mutant strain, were similar except that the growth rate of the ΔluxS strain was lower than that of the wild-type strain. "
"18","wild","Sterile supernatant at 10% was added to overnight cultures of the wild-type strain EIB202 at the beginning of culture. a, EIB202 at 6 h; b, ΔluxS strain at 6 h; c, ΔluxS strain with supernatant at 6 h; d, EIB202 at 12 h; e, ΔluxS strain at 12 h; f, ΔluxS strain with supernatant at 12 h; g, EIB202 at 24 h; h, ΔluxS strain at 24 h; i, ΔluxS strain with supernatant at 24 h. "
"19","wild","The result of the experiment measuring penetration through mucin found that the number of cells and the distance penetrated by the ΔluxS strain were sharply decreased compared to those of the wild-type strain for the whole experimental period, suggesting that the luxS gene deletion decreased the colonization ability and the virulence of E. piscicida.
