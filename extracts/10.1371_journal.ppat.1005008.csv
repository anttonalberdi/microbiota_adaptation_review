"1","wild","Tissue-specific expression patterns of the blood group glycosyltransferase β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B4galnt2) are variable in wild mouse populations, and loss of B4galnt2 expression is associated with altered intestinal microbiota. "
"2","wild","We speculate that B4galnt2-specific differences in host susceptibility to intestinal pathogens underlie the strong signatures of balancing selection observed at the B4galnt2 locus in wild mouse populations. "
"3","wild","The B4galnt2 gene is responsible for the synthesis of the Sd(a)/Cad carbohydrate blood group antigen and displays variable tissue-specific expression patterns in wild mouse populations. "
"4","wild","Mvwf1 was first described in the RIIIS/J inbred mouse strain [22], and subsequent studies revealed RIIIS/J-like B4galnt2 alleles, which confer the B4galnt2 tissue-specific switch from gut (epithelial) to blood vessel (endothelial) expression, to be common in wild mouse populations [24]. "
"5","wild","Taken together, the prevalence of alleles conferring the tissue-specific switch in B4galnt2 expression in mice, the strong signatures of selection observed at the B4galnt2 locus in wild mouse populations and the altered resident microbiota found in B4galnt2-deficient mice support the hypothesis that variant tissue-specific B4galnt2 expression alters susceptibility to enteric infections in mice. "
"6","wild","However, the higher frequency of negative weak interactions overall has a stabilizing effect preventing the communities from collapsing (positive/ negative interactions = 0.482; # P < 0.100, * P < 0.050, ** P < 0.010, *** P < 0.001). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1005008.g008 B4galnt2 Expression and Salmonella Infection PLOS Pathogens | DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1005008 July 2, 2015 16 / 32 this study, we investigated intestinal infection as a potential driver of selection at B4galnt2 observed in the wild by studying the effect of variant tissue-specific expression of B4galnt2 on host-microbiota interactions and susceptibility to intestinal infection with Salmonella. "
"7","wild","Thus, a complex scenario including B4galnt2-dependent changes in microbial communities, vascular immune phenotypes, bleeding tendencies and susceptibility to intestinal infections likely contributes to the maintenance of variation at B4galnt2 in wild mouse populations. "
"8","wild","As a negative control cells were treated with scrambled siRNA. 24h post transfection cells were infected with an MOI 50 of wildtype S. "
"9","adaptation","Over time, a steady cycle of adaptation and counter-adaptation has left molecular traces in the genomes of many organisms including humans [43]. "
"10","mutant","Typhimurium SL1344 (“acute” infection, examined after 24 hours [28]) or the attenuated ΔaroAmutant (“chronic” infection, examined after 14 days [29]). "
"11","inbred","Mvwf1 was first described in the RIIIS/J inbred mouse strain [22], and subsequent studies revealed RIIIS/J-like B4galnt2 alleles, which confer the B4galnt2 tissue-specific switch from gut (epithelial) to blood vessel (endothelial) expression, to be common in wild mouse populations [24]. "
"12","model","To test this, we challenged mice genetically engineered to express different B4galnt2 tissue-specific patterns with a Salmonella Typhimurium infection model. "
"13","model","Using an established model for Salmonella Typhimurium induced colitis, we found that loss of B4galnt2 expression in the intestinal epithelium decreases susceptibility to infection. "
"14","model","To investigate the role of variant host B4galnt2 expression in the context of intestinal infection, we challenged mice engineered to express B4galnt2 in various tissue-specific patterns with a mouse model of the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. "
"15","model","Typhimuriuminduced colitis To test the hypothesis that expression of intestinal B4galnt2 glycans influences host susceptibility to enteric pathogens, we used an established model for S. "
"16","model","After infection in both the acute and chronic Salmonellamodels, mice expressing B4galnt2 in the intestinal epithelium (B6 +// RIII and B6 +// RIII +) exhibited higher numbers of detached epithelial cells and neutrophils within the cecal lumen, increased inflammatory cell infiltration [29, 30] within the intestinal mucosa, and worsened submucosal edema in the ceca (Fig 1A). "
"17","model","Accordingly, mice that did not express B4galnt2 in the intestinal epithelium (B6 -/-) developed significantly less cecal inflammation in both the acute and chronic infection model (Fig 1C). "
