"
"2","adaptat","These functional increases support the concept of targeting the serotonin signaling system to augment intestinal adaptation in the setting of intestinal failure. "
"3","adaptat","The microbiota of the small intestine is also known to modulate host intestinal adaptation by microbial-derived metabolites [36]. "
"4","adaptat","Such changes, particularly taller villi, deeper crypts and increase in crypt cell proliferation, are hallmark features of intestinal adaptation following bowel resection in both humans and animal models [39]. "
"5","adaptat","Clinical implications of these findings are important for patients who would benefit from enhanced intestinal adaptation, such as those who are dependent on parenteral nutrition due to inadequate bowel length. "
"6","adaptat","A short bowel animal model would serve as the next step to investigate the role of potentiated serotonin signaling in augmenting thenative intestinal adaptationprocess. "
