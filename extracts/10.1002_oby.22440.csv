"1","wild","Methods: BD was performed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed FXR knockout (FXRko) and wild-type (WT) animals. "
"2","wild","We previously demonstrated that delivery of BAs to the distal intestine using bile diversion (BD) surgery improved high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and energy expenditure in wild-type (WT) mice (4). "
"3","adaptation","Mucosal adaptation to enteral nutrients is dependent on the physiologic actions of glucagon-like peptide-2 in mice. "
"4","model","Farnesoid X receptor deficiency improves glucose homeostasis in mouse models of obesity. "
"5","model","Microbiome remodelling leads to inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor signalling and decreased obesity. "
"6","knockout","Methods: BD was performed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed FXR knockout (FXRko) and wild-type (WT) animals. "
"7","knockout","Methods Mice and surgery Age-matched FXR knockout (FXRko) mice and their WT littermate male mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) were used in the current study. "
"8","knockout","Another limitation of this study is that using a global knockout of FXR cannot differentiate the tissue-specific effects of FXR activity or modulation. "
"9","knockout","Our results contribute to the understanding of the mixed metabolic phenotypes observed in global FXR knockouts and provide the potential to develop tissue-specific FXR manipulations for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. "
