"1","wild","Methods: BD was performed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed FXR knockout (FXRko) and wild-type (WT) animals. "
"2","wild","We previously demonstrated that delivery of BAs to the distal intestine using bile diversion (BD) surgery improved high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and energy expenditure in wild-type (WT) mice (4). "
"3","adaptat","Mucosal adaptation to enteral nutrients is dependent on the physiologic actions of glucagon-like peptide-2 in mice. "
"4","model","Farnesoid X receptor deficiency improves glucose homeostasis in mouse models of obesity. "
"5","model","Microbiome remodelling leads to inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor signalling and decreased obesity. "
"6","knockout","Methods: BD was performed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed FXR knockout (FXRko) and wild-type (WT) animals. "
"7","knockout","Methods Mice and surgery Age-matched FXR knockout (FXRko) mice and their WT littermate male mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) were used in the current study. "
"8","knockout","Another limitation of this study is that using a global knockout of FXR cannot differentiate the tissue-specific effects of FXR activity or modulation. "
"9","knockout","Our results contribute to the understanding of the mixed metabolic phenotypes observed in global FXR knockouts and provide the potential to develop tissue-specific FXR manipulations for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. "
"10","disease","FXR deficiency altered gut microbiota composition with a specific increase in phylum Proteobacteria that may act as a possible microbial signature of some diseases. "
"11","disease","The pathogenesis of liver steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was shown to involve dysregulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and FGF21 (28). "
"12","disease","More interestingly, the lack of FXR led to an increase in the phylum Proteobacteria that was shown to produce lipopolysaccharide and act as a possible microbial signature of diseases, including metabolic disorders (38). "
"13","disease","An intestinal microbiota-farnesoid X receptor axis modulates metabolic disease. "
"14","disease","Efficacy and safety of the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. "
"15","environment","These mice were housed in the Animal Resources Center at the University of Chicago in a specific pathogen-free, temperature-controlled environment with a 12-hour light-dark cycle. "
"16","human","Calibration standards were prepared by adding individual BAs at a concentration range of 12 ng/mL to 1.5 μg/mL to charcoal-stripped human serum. "
"17","human","Recent findings showed that FXR activation altered gut microbiota composition in humans (37). "
"18","human","FXR agonists have been utilized as therapy for obesity and diabetes in rodents (43) and in humans (44). "
"19","human","One major limitation of our findings relates to the evidence that human and mouse BA composition is markedly different; i.e., primary BAs in humans include cholic acid and CDCA conjugated with glycine, whereas mice also produce MCA species conjugated with taurine (TaMCA and TbMCA). "
"20","human","Consequently, the extrapolation of BA-related results in mice must be carefully interpreted concerning human implications. "
"21","human","Serum bile acids are higher in humans with prior gastric bypass: potential contribution to improved glucose and lipid metabolism. "
"22","human","FXR-dependent modulation of the human small intestinal microbiome by the bile acid derivative obeticholic acid. "
"23","human","Conversion of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into their 7-oxo derivatives by Bacteroides intestinalis AM-1 isolated from human feces. "
