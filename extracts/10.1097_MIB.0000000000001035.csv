"
"5","model","Conversely, studies also document a downregulation of TLR5 in both animal models of colitis and patients with IBD.24,25 As such, the role of flagellin/TLR5 in the pathogenesis of IBD is controversial (i.e., pathogenic versus protective) and the cell types that express TLR5, as well as the TLR5-dependent mechanisms that regulate gut permeability and homeostasis in response to the gut microbiome, remain unclear. "
"6","model","The SAMP mouse strain represents a chronic model of IBD and provides an excellent system to study the contributions made by specific cell types to the development of enteritis before the onset of inflammation, during the initiation and acute phase of inflammation, and when chronic disease is established.26 Additionally, since SAMP mice were derived from brother–sister mating of WT AKR mice (parental strain),27 the phenotype occurs spontaneously as in the human condition, without chemical, genetic, or immunologic manipulation. "
"7","model","IEC-derived TLR5 and Circulating Antiflagellin IgG Levels Are Increased Early During SAMP Ileitis, and Both Are Abrogated in the Absence of the Commensal Microflora Our previous studies showed that a primary epithelial barrier defect is present early in the small intestine of 3-week-old SAMP mice, before the onset of ileal inflammation, that likely drives ileitis and persists even in a GF setting.33 SAMP mice, however, still display ileal inflammation, albeit delayed and attenuated, when raised under GF conditions compared with age-matched SPF-raised SAMP,35 indicating that importance of the interaction(s) between the commensal microflora and the intestinal epithelium in this model. "
"8","model","In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that dysregulation of tolerance to intestinal TLR-stimulants and disruption of the epithelial barrier separating MAMPs from responsive, underlying tissues may contribute to the development or perpetuation of IBD.5 For example, although it is well established that the presence of luminal MAMPs is not sufficient to initiate IBDs in animal models,53–55 it has been shown that TLR-mediated detection of some luminal MAMPs can exacerbate existing disease.54–56 Moreover, although the healthy gut contains appreciable quantities of soluble ligands for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5, the relative abundance of stimulants within the gut microbiota for these receptors can increase dramatically during the course of experimental IBD.23 Our earlier studies, in fact, showed that the commensal bacterial flora, although not essential for the initiation of ileitis in the SAMP mouse strain, plays a paramount role in the progression and severity of gut inflammation characteristic of these mice.30,33,35 Specifically, the small intestinal permeability defect that precedes ileitis in these mice,33 as well as the ileitis phenotype itself, persists under GF conditions; however, the onset of disease is markedly delayed and the severity significantly dampened, lacking the proinflammatory Th2 immune component present in SPF-raised SAMP.31,32,35 In the present study, our results provide evidence that the commensal microbiota also drives the expression of TLR5 on ilea IECs. "
"9","model","Although our data differ from previous work that indicates a primary protective role for flagellin/TLR5 activation in IBD,15,42,57 there are certainly important differences to consider, particularly when comparing SAMP mice with the TLR5 deficient (Tlr52/2) model. "
