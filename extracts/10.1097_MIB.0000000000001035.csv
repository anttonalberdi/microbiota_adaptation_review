"1","wild","Irradiated SAMP receiving either wild-type (AKR) or SAMP bone marrow (BM) developed severe ileitis and displayed increased ileal Tlr5 compared with AKR recipients of either SAMP or AKR bone marrow, neither of which conferred ileitis, suggesting that elevated TLR5 in native SAMP is derived primarily from a nonhematopoietic (e.g., epithelial) source.

"4","model","(Inflamm Bowel Dis 2017;23:392–403) Key Words: epithelial barrier function, epithelial permeability, TLR5, flagellin, gut microbiome, SAMP1/YitFc model of CD-like ileitis I nflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease(CD) and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract resulting from a loss of homeostasis between the intestinal immune system and the gut microbiome in genetically-predisposed individuals.1 Inappropriate mucosal immune responses, due to disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and/or dysregulated tolerance to the commensal flora, likely contribute to the development and perpetuation of IBD.2–5 Several lines of evidence have shown that the gut microbiome is crucial for the development of a normal mucosal immune system throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but can also play a central role in the pathogenesis of IBD.6 In support of this concept, the majority of genetically-susceptible murine models of colitis do not develop significant inflammation when raised in a germ-free (GF) environment7–10; whereas in others, disease can be attenuated or completely abolished with antibiotic (ABX) treatment.11,12 In this context, innate immune responses that recognize conserved microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan, are important for microbial–host interactions and intestinal homeostasis.13 Critical to the host’s sensing of microbes are members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family that, alone or in combination, recognize a wide array of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) on either pathogenic or commensal bacteria.13 TLRs are expressed on cells within the gut mucosa, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), as well as on lamina propria macrophages and dendritic cells.14–17 TLR2, -4, and -5 are the major cell-surface sensors of bacterial Supplemental digital content is available for this article. "
"5","model","Conversely, studies also document a downregulation of TLR5 in both animal models of colitis and patients with IBD.24,25 As such, the role of flagellin/TLR5 in the pathogenesis of IBD is controversial (i.e., pathogenic versus protective) and the cell types that express TLR5, as well as the TLR5-dependent mechanisms that regulate gut permeability and homeostasis in response to the gut microbiome, remain unclear. "
"6","model","The SAMP mouse strain represents a chronic model of IBD and provides an excellent system to study the contributions made by specific cell types to the development of enteritis before the onset of inflammation, during the initiation and acute phase of inflammation, and when chronic disease is established.26 Additionally, since SAMP mice were derived from brother–sister mating of WT AKR mice (parental strain),27 the phenotype occurs spontaneously as in the human condition, without chemical, genetic, or immunologic manipulation. "
"7","model","IEC-derived TLR5 and Circulating Antiflagellin IgG Levels Are Increased Early During SAMP Ileitis, and Both Are Abrogated in the Absence of the Commensal Microflora Our previous studies showed that a primary epithelial barrier defect is present early in the small intestine of 3-week-old SAMP mice, before the onset of ileal inflammation, that likely drives ileitis and persists even in a GF setting.33 SAMP mice, however, still display ileal inflammation, albeit delayed and attenuated, when raised under GF conditions compared with age-matched SPF-raised SAMP,35 indicating that importance of the interaction(s) between the commensal microflora and the intestinal epithelium in this model. "
"8","model","In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that dysregulation of tolerance to intestinal TLR-stimulants and disruption of the epithelial barrier separating MAMPs from responsive, underlying tissues may contribute to the development or perpetuation of IBD.5 For example, although it is well established that the presence of luminal MAMPs is not sufficient to initiate IBDs in animal models,53–55 it has been shown that TLR-mediated detection of some luminal MAMPs can exacerbate existing disease.54–56 Moreover, although the healthy gut contains appreciable quantities of soluble ligands for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5, the relative abundance of stimulants within the gut microbiota for these receptors can increase dramatically during the course of experimental IBD.23 Our earlier studies, in fact, showed that the commensal bacterial flora, although not essential for the initiation of ileitis in the SAMP mouse strain, plays a paramount role in the progression and severity of gut inflammation characteristic of these mice.30,33,35 Specifically, the small intestinal permeability defect that precedes ileitis in these mice,33 as well as the ileitis phenotype itself, persists under GF conditions; however, the onset of disease is markedly delayed and the severity significantly dampened, lacking the proinflammatory Th2 immune component present in SPF-raised SAMP.31,32,35 In the present study, our results provide evidence that the commensal microbiota also drives the expression of TLR5 on ilea IECs. "
"9","model","Although our data differ from previous work that indicates a primary protective role for flagellin/TLR5 activation in IBD,15,42,57 there are certainly important differences to consider, particularly when comparing SAMP mice with the TLR5 deficient (Tlr52/2) model. "
