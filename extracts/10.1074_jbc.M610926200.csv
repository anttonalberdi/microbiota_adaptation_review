"1","wild","To define microbial determinants and molecular correlates of the host response to translocation via these two routes, we colonized germ-free transgenic mice expressing the human enterocyte-associated E-cadherin receptor with wildtype (WT) or mutant L. monocytogenes strains, or its nonpathogenic noninvasive relative Listeria innocua, or with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent gut symbiont.

"3","mutant","To define microbial determinants and molecular correlates of the host response to translocation via these two routes, we colonized germ-free transgenic mice expressing the human enterocyte-associated E-cadherin receptor with wildtype (WT) or mutant L. monocytogenes strains, or its nonpathogenic noninvasive relative Listeria innocua, or with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent gut symbiont. "
"4","mutant","Gainand loss-of-function experiments with L. innocua and L. monocytogenes, respectively, demonstrated that the 773-member transcriptional signature of the response to WT L. monocytogenes is largely conserved in theinlAmutant. "
"5","mutant","The host response is markedly attenuated in a listeriolysin-deficient (hly) mutant despite its ability to be translocated to the lamina propria. "
"6","mutant","To do so, we colonized the animals with (i) WT L. monocytogenes and isogenicmutant strainswith inlA, inlB, or hly deletions; (ii) WT L. innocua and isogenic strains engineered to express InlA or LLO; or (iii) Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a sequenced, well characterized, human gut symbiont that is an adept, adaptive forager of dietary polysaccharides (12, 13). "
"7","mutant","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Bacterial Strains—L. monocytogenes WT reference strain EGD (L. monocytogenes, BUG 600) and isogenic mutants in hly (Lm(hly), BUG 1954), inlA (Lm(inlA), BUG 947), and inlA plus inlB (Lm(inlAB), BUG 949), L. innocua WT reference strain (BUG 499), L. innocua expressing InlA (Li(inlA), BUG 1489), and L. innocua expressing LLO (Li(hly), BUG 226) and the B. thetaiotaomicron type stain (VPI-5482) were cultured as described (8, 13). "
"8","mutant","GF Fabpi-hEcad mice were colonized with a strain of L. innocua engineered for heterologous expression of InlA (Li(inlA)) or with mutant strains of L. monocytogenes that lack either inlA (Lm(inlA)) or both inlA and inlB (Lm(inlAB)). "
"9","mutant","Moreover, like its WT L. monocytogenes parent strain, the isogenic Lm(inlA) mutant disseminated to the spleen (Fig. "
"10","mutant","When the levels of expression of these 157 genes were referenced to the differences noted between WT L. monocytogenes versus the GF, L. innocua and B. thetaiotaomicron base-line groups, it was apparent that the internalin mutants produce attenuated responses for both upand downregulated genes (supplemental Fig. "

"12","mutant","As in the case of L. monocytogenes internalin, we performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to examine the role of LLO.GFFabpi-hEcadmicewere colonized for 3 days with a strain of L. innocua expressing LLO (Li(hly)) or with a L. monocytogenes mutant with a deletion in hly. "
"13","mutant","In accord with the inability of L. monocytogenes LLO mutants to persist in monocytes/macrophages (29), splenic CFU levels were 34-fold lower in mice mono-associated with the mutant compared with the WT L. monocytogenes strain (p  0.05; Fig. "
"14","mutant","Isogenic L. monocytogenes inlA and L. monocytogenes inlAB mutants, although unable to invade enterocytes and the underlying lamina propria, are still able to cross the gut barrier and disseminate to the spleen, most probably reflecting the increased luminal bacterial load in mono-associated gnotobiotic mice compared with infected, conventionally raised animals.

"19","model","DISCUSSION We have used an environmentally and genetically defined, simplified, and “humanized” gnotobiotic transgenic mouse model of oral listeria infection to (i) characterize canonical host signaling pathways that distinguish the transcriptional response to this enteropathogen in a specified intestinal habitat from the response evoked by its nonpathogenic relative, L. innocua, or the gut symbiont, B. thetaiotaomicron; and (ii) assess the contributions of L. monocytogenes genes to enteroinvasion and this transcriptional response.
