"1","wild","Here, we assess the impact of Wolbachia infection of Ae. aegypti on the microbiome of wild mosquito populations (adults and larvae) collected from release sites in Cairns, Australia, by profiling the 16S rRNA gene using next generation sequencing. "
"2","wild","Given the large-scale releases of Wolbachia into wild populations of Ae. aegypti globally, it is of interest to understand whether the presence of the endosymbiont has an impact on the mosquito microbiome. "
"3","wild","Both of these studies indicated that Wolbachia had little impact on the microbiome, but as laboratory populations have considerably different microbiome compositions than wild mosquitoes (Boissi√®re et al. "
"4","wild","Thus, the potential of Wolbachia to affect the microbiome of wild populations of Ae. aegypti is still unknown. "
"5","wild","In this study, we investigated the effect of Wolbachia infection on the microbiome of wild caught mosquitoes from Australia, collected from the 2013 release site of Wolbachia wMel-infected mosquitoes from distinct locations in Cairns, Australia (Fig. "

"10","fitness","Abstract Insect-symbiont interactions are known to play key roles in host functions and fitness. "
"11","fitness","More broadly, the overall structure of the microbiome can also be important in the fitness of insects such as bees and mosquitoes, with changes to the composition of the microbiome shown to increase the mortality of bees following exposure to bacterial pathogens (Raymann et al. 2017) and to alter mosquito fecundity (Gaio Ade et al. "
"12","fitness","It is evident in cases such as these where significant microbiome-host interactions occur, disturbing the insect bacterial population can adversely affect host fitness (Douglas 2011). "
"13","fitness","Perhaps more importantly, however, the limited effects on native microbiome diversity suggest a low potential for Wolbachia to impact host fitness in this capacity. "
