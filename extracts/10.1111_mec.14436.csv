"1","wild","Here, we assess the impact of Wolbachia infection of Ae. aegypti on the microbiome of wild mosquito populations (adults and larvae) collected from release sites in Cairns, Australia, by profiling the 16S rRNA gene using next generation sequencing. "
"2","wild","Given the large-scale releases of Wolbachia into wild populations of Ae. aegypti globally, it is of interest to understand whether the presence of the endosymbiont has an impact on the mosquito microbiome. "
"3","wild","Both of these studies indicated that Wolbachia had little impact on the microbiome, but as laboratory populations have considerably different microbiome compositions than wild mosquitoes (Boissière et al. "
"4","wild","Thus, the potential of Wolbachia to affect the microbiome of wild populations of Ae. aegypti is still unknown. "
"5","wild","In this study, we investigated the effect of Wolbachia infection on the microbiome of wild caught mosquitoes from Australia, collected from the 2013 release site of Wolbachia wMel-infected mosquitoes from distinct locations in Cairns, Australia (Fig. "

"10","fitness","Abstract Insect-symbiont interactions are known to play key roles in host functions and fitness. "
"11","fitness","More broadly, the overall structure of the microbiome can also be important in the fitness of insects such as bees and mosquitoes, with changes to the composition of the microbiome shown to increase the mortality of bees following exposure to bacterial pathogens (Raymann et al. 2017) and to alter mosquito fecundity (Gaio Ade et al. "
"12","fitness","It is evident in cases such as these where significant microbiome-host interactions occur, disturbing the insect bacterial population can adversely affect host fitness (Douglas 2011). "
"13","fitness","Perhaps more importantly, however, the limited effects on native microbiome diversity suggest a low potential for Wolbachia to impact host fitness in this capacity. "

"15","model","To include the collection site as a factor, we performed the edgeR differential abundance calculation using a linear model. "
"16","model","Correlation between the concentration (log counts-per-million; logCPM) and the differential relative abundance (log fold change; logFC) of genera undergoing significant changes in relative abundance in Wolbachia-positive adults used SPSS statistics software (version 22, SPSS Inc, IBM). logCPM and logFC values that were calculated using the linear model to include collection site as a factor of analysis (described above) were used to perform a Pearson’s correlation using a two-tailed test. "
"17","model","We examined differential abundance of taxa between Wolbachia-negative and Wolbachia-positive samples of Ae. aegypti larvae and adults by Illumina sequencing, assigning reads to OTUs, and using a statistical model to calculate fold changes in abundance. "
"18","model","To assess whether there was a relationship between the log fold change and the relative concentration of genera showing differential relative abundance, we plotted log fold change against log counts-permillion from the datasets calculated using the linear model to include collection site as a factor (Fig. "
"19","model","Open circles indicate that the taxon also demonstrated significant differential abundance in Wolbachia-positive larvae calculated using a linear model to include collection site as a factor. "
"20","model","Taxa that demonstrated significant differential abundance in Wolbachia-positive adults calculated using a linear model to include collection site as a factor are shown coloured by phylum. "
"21","model","Data points indicated in red are those calculated to undergo significant changes (FDR < 0.05) in relative abundance using a linear model to include collection site as a factor. "
"22","environment","Most notably, host developmental stage, feeding status, and environmental factors including temperature have been shown to significantly influence symbiotic complexity (Lindh et al. "
"23","environment","Such differences may be accounted for by factors including host genetic background, mosquito age or environmental factors that are not controlled for within this study. "
"24","environment","Despite the fact that Wolbachia are vertically transmitted, our results indicate that Wolbachia infection has minimal effect on the larval microbiome, which is thought to largely be acquired from their surrounding environment (Coon et al. "
"25","environment","The authors suggest that the variable nature of aquatic environments would prevent mosquitoes from reliably encountering particular species. "
"26","human","The common insect endosymbiont Wolbachia can reduce the ability of several human pathogens, including arboviruses and the malaria parasite, to replicate in insect hosts. "
"27","human","(2015) Antibiotics in ingested human blood affect the mosquito microbiota and capacity to transmit malaria. "
"28","laboratory","To date, the most direct approach has been to characterise the microbiome of Ae. aegypti with and without Wolbachia infection using laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti stably infected with Wolbachia strain wMel (Audsley et al. 2017) and laboratory-reared An. stephensi stably infected with Wolbachia strain wAlbB (Chen et al. "
"29","laboratory","Both of these studies indicated that Wolbachia had little impact on the microbiome, but as laboratory populations have considerably different microbiome compositions than wild mosquitoes (Boissière et al. "
"30","laboratory","2014; Ramirez et al. 2012), laboratory based studies may not be fully informative. "
"31","laboratory","Adults were collected at 12 weeks post the first release of Wolbachia infected mosquitoes, which was 4 weeks post the final release to allow time for any remaining laboratory reared adult release material to have died and ensure that adults collected were at least first generation in the field. "
