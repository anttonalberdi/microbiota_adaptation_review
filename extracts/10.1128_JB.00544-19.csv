"1","wild","In this report, we introduce a negative selection system for rapid and efficient allelic exchange in wild Bacteroides species that does not require any alterations to the genetic background or a nutritionally defined culture medium. "
"2","wild","In this report, we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for targeted genetic manipulation of diverse wild-type Bacteroides species from the human gut. "
"3","wild","Genetic manipulation of wild human gut Bacteroides. "
"4","wild","These approaches, which rely on a tightly regulated inducible expression system, provide an attractive method for negative selection in wildtype bacterial strains. "

"6","wild","We modified pSIE1 to include genomic sequences of the flanking regions adjacent to the lpxF gene and used this plasmid to delete lpxF from wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron strain VPI-5482 (Fig. "
"7","wild","Notably, deletion of BVU_1078 also significantly increased PMB sensitivity, and complementation restored the wild-type phenotype, directly implicating this gene in AMP resistance (Fig. 4; also see Table S2). "
"8","wild","Mass spectrometric analysis of lipid A from the wild-type strain and ΔlpxF, ΔBVU_1078, and double deletion mutants revealed the expected lpxF-dependent dephosphorylation at the 4= position but no BVU_1078-dependent differences in lipid A structure (Fig. "

"11","wild","(Bottom) PCR results from wild-type (WT), mutant, and complemented strains are shown. "
"12","wild","(B) PMB sensitivity of wild-type (), mutant (), and complemented (c) strains. "
"13","wild","(D) PMB sensitivity of the wild-type B. vulgatus human isolate (), its isogenic lpxF mutant (), and the complemented strain (c). "
"14","wild","12 8. study demonstrates how pSIE1 can be used successively to engineer multiple modifications in wild-type Bacteroides strains. "
"15","wild","PMB resistance in wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron is significantly greater than resistance in a B. vulgatus ΔBVU_1078 mutant, although both of these strains contain an lpxF homolog and lack a BVU_1078 homolog. "
"16","wild","First, this approach provides the ability to perform targeted genetic modification in a wide variety of wild-type Bacteroides species, avoiding the requirement for construction of a genetically modified parent strain for each bacterial strain of interest and allowing study of pathways that may be affected by the parental genetic modification.
