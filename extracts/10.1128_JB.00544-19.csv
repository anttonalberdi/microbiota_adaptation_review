"6","wild","We modified pSIE1 to include genomic sequences of the flanking regions adjacent to the lpxF gene and used this plasmid to delete lpxF from wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron strain VPI-5482 (Fig. "
"7","wild","Notably, deletion of BVU_1078 also significantly increased PMB sensitivity, and complementation restored the wild-type phenotype, directly implicating this gene in AMP resistance (Fig. 4; also see Table S2). "
"8","wild","Mass spectrometric analysis of lipid A from the wild-type strain and ΔlpxF, ΔBVU_1078, and double deletion mutants revealed the expected lpxF-dependent dephosphorylation at the 4= position but no BVU_1078-dependent differences in lipid A structure (Fig. "

"15","wild","PMB resistance in wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron is significantly greater than resistance in a B. vulgatus ΔBVU_1078 mutant, although both of these strains contain an lpxF homolog and lack a BVU_1078 homolog. "
"16","wild","First, this approach provides the ability to perform targeted genetic modification in a wide variety of wild-type Bacteroides species, avoiding the requirement for construction of a genetically modified parent strain for each bacterial strain of interest and allowing study of pathways that may be affected by the parental genetic modification. "

"18","mutant","In a second step, the counterselectable marker is used to select for cells that have excised the plasmid (and included antibiotic resistance cassette) via a second recombination event, producing mutant and revertant strains by negative selection. "
"19","mutant","In addition, escape mutants in which the integrated allelic exchange vector is not resolved from the genome but instead acquires any single inactivating mutation in the negative selection marker can impede strain construction. "
"20","mutant","Further, experimental studies using these mutants may be complicated by the impact of the parental strain modification on bacterial physiology. "
"21","mutant","Deletion of lpxF (BT_1854) from a B. thetaiotaomicron tdk mutant increases sensitivity to the AMP polymyxin B (PMB) by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude (9). "
"22","mutant","Of the 48 aTCresistant clones tested, all were sensitive to erythromycin, validating the efficacy of this counterselectable cassette in eliminating unresolved merodiploids and preventing escape mutants (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). "
"23","mutant","We next restored lpxF function to the mutant by complementation with this gene, expressed in single copy in a heterologous genomic location. "
"24","mutant","PMB sensitivity of the mutant strain, compared to the parent strain or complemented mutants, establishes that the phenotypes match these genotypes (Fig. "
"25","mutant","Transposon mutant screens for PMB sensitivity in nonmodel Bacteroides species identified multiple genes that appeared to be required for PMB resistance in those species, despite being absent from the PMB-resistant species B. thetaiotaomicron (9). "

"33","mutant","As with any genetic manipulation, complementation of mutants is an important step; for example, if a recipient strain contains a conjugative transposon that mobilizes spontaneously or in response to aTC exposure, then comparison of parental, mutant, and complemented strains will directly connect the intended mutation with the phenotype. "
"34","mutant","Validated merodiploids (approximately one to three) were then grown overnight in TYG medium, plated on BHI plates containing aTC, and screened by PCR (primers 7 to 10, 15, 16, 21, 22, and 25 to 28) and antibiotic selection to identify the desired mutants. "
