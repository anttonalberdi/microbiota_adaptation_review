"1","wild","Both colitic and noncolitic T5KO exhibited transiently unstable microbiotas, with lasting differences in colitic T5KO, while their noncolitic siblings stabilized their microbiotas to resemble wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","Increased Volatility in Microbiota of T5KO Mice Stool from wild-type, noncolitic, and colitic T5KO mice (n = 5–8 mice per group) was collected weekly for 9 weeks after weaning (from 3 weeks old to 11 weeks old). "
"3","wild","Colitic T5KO Mice Harbored Abnormal Amount of Enterobacteria (A) Stool from wild-type, noncolitic, and colitic T5KOmice (n = 6–8mice per group) were collected weekly for 9 weeks after weaning (from 3 weeks old to 11 weeks old). "
"4","wild","Germ-free T5KO Mice Are Highly Susceptible to Early AIEC LF82 Infection Germ-free wild-type and T5KO mice (n = 4 mice per group) were orally infected with 107 flagellate AIEC LF82 bacteria. "
"5","wild","Transient AIEC LF82 Infection Resulted in a Chronic Basal In Germ-free wild-type and T5KOmice (n = 3–7 mice per group) were orally infected T5KO mice were transferred to a sterile cage without treatment. "
"6","mutant","Such delayed bacterial clearance by T5KO, relative to WT, mice was not seen upon exposure to a flagellin-deficient AIEC LF82 mutant, indicating that the increased susceptibility of T5KO to AIEC LF82 colonization reflects a direct role for TLR5 in recognition of AIEC LF82 flagella. "
"7","mutant","In either case, clearance of flagellate AIEC strain LF82, but not an aflagellate isogenic mutant strain, was delayed in T5KO mice, indicating a role for TLR5 in protecting against this, and perhaps other motile, bacteria. "
"8","mutant","Bacterial Infections CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 (Darfeuille-Michaud, 2002), isogenic nonflagellate mutant LF82-DfliC (Barnich et al., 2003), S. typhimurium SL3201, and E. coli F18 were grown overnight at 37C without agitation in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. "
"9","model","That analogous observations have been made with murine models of colitis (e.g., IL-10 KO [Matharu et al., 2009; Sellon et al., 1998]) provides broad support for the notion that the composition of the gut microbiota is an important environmental determinant of colitis, but such approaches of complete microbiota exchange or ablation have not been especially informative in defining which changes are closely correlated with colitis development, nor do they shed much light on underlying mechanism. "
"10","model","Such incomplete penetrance poses logistical challenges in experimental design when using this model. "
"11","model","Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host. "
