"1","wild","Both colitic and noncolitic T5KO exhibited transiently unstable microbiotas, with lasting differences in colitic T5KO, while their noncolitic siblings stabilized their microbiotas to resemble wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","Increased Volatility in Microbiota of T5KO Mice Stool from wild-type, noncolitic, and colitic T5KO mice (n = 5–8 mice per group) was collected weekly for 9 weeks after weaning (from 3 weeks old to 11 weeks old). "
"3","wild","Colitic T5KO Mice Harbored Abnormal Amount of Enterobacteria (A) Stool from wild-type, noncolitic, and colitic T5KOmice (n = 6–8mice per group) were collected weekly for 9 weeks after weaning (from 3 weeks old to 11 weeks old). "
"4","wild","Germ-free T5KO Mice Are Highly Susceptible to Early AIEC LF82 Infection Germ-free wild-type and T5KO mice (n = 4 mice per group) were orally infected with 107 flagellate AIEC LF82 bacteria. "
"5","wild","Transient AIEC LF82 Infection Resulted in a Chronic Basal In Germ-free wild-type and T5KOmice (n = 3–7 mice per group) were orally infected T5KO mice were transferred to a sterile cage without treatment. "
"6","mutant","Such delayed bacterial clearance by T5KO, relative to WT, mice was not seen upon exposure to a flagellin-deficient AIEC LF82 mutant, indicating that the increased susceptibility of T5KO to AIEC LF82 colonization reflects a direct role for TLR5 in recognition of AIEC LF82 flagella. "
"7","mutant","In either case, clearance of flagellate AIEC strain LF82, but not an aflagellate isogenic mutant strain, was delayed in T5KO mice, indicating a role for TLR5 in protecting against this, and perhaps other motile, bacteria. "
"8","mutant","Bacterial Infections CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 (Darfeuille-Michaud, 2002), isogenic nonflagellate mutant LF82-DfliC (Barnich et al., 2003), S. typhimurium SL3201, and E. coli F18 were grown overnight at 37C without agitation in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. "
"9","model","That analogous observations have been made with murine models of colitis (e.g., IL-10 KO [Matharu et al., 2009; Sellon et al., 1998]) provides broad support for the notion that the composition of the gut microbiota is an important environmental determinant of colitis, but such approaches of complete microbiota exchange or ablation have not been especially informative in defining which changes are closely correlated with colitis development, nor do they shed much light on underlying mechanism. "
"10","model","Such incomplete penetrance poses logistical challenges in experimental design when using this model. "
"11","model","Pretreatment of mice with streptomycin provides a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium colitis model that allows analysis of both pathogen and host. "
"12","disease","A Crohn’s disease-associated E. coli strain induced chronic colitis in T5KO, which persisted well after the exogenously introduced bacterial species had been eliminated. "
"13","disease","INTRODUCTION Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to result from a breakdown in the relationship between the intestinal mucosalCell Hosimmune system and the large microbial biomass, including about 100 trillion bacteria, that inhabits this organ (Kaser et al., 2010; Xavier and Podolsky, 2007). "
"14","disease","While flagellin is a microbe-associated molecular pattern that is present at the bacterial surface of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli strains, differential regulation of flagellin expression has been suggested between commensal bacteria and Crohn’s disease (CD)-associated AIEC, and differential regulation under the two-component EnvZ/OmpR regulatory system (Rolhion et al., 2007). "
"15","disease","However, it is a higher penetrance rate than that seen for persons homozygous for the Nod2 frameshift mutation (in which a 17-fold increase results in a disease risk of perhaps 5%), and well beyond the 4% IBD concordance seen among dizygotic twins (Cho and Brant, 2011). "
"16","disease","Increased Susceptibility of TLR5-Deficient Mice to E. coli LF82 Infection The association of enterobacteria with colitis could be a consequence of colitis and/or reflect a role for such bacteria in driving disease. "
"17","disease","While interperson variance, combined with the rapid and dramatic effects of diet, poses a considerable obstacle to this endeavor, perhaps the greatest obscurant to understanding the role of themicrobiota in IBD, and other diseases, is that it has generally only been possible to examine the microbiota in patients after they have been diagnosed, which typically takes place well after initial symptoms occurred. "
"18","disease","Thus, while a number of studies have reported alterations in the microbiota in IBD, the extent to which these occur late or early in the disease process, and whether they are a cause or consequence of disease, remains undefined. "
"19","disease","Together, these results suggest that the elevated enterobacteria observed in colitic T5KO mice are likely both a cause and a consequence of colitis and, moreover, that classic concepts of microbial causation of disease such as Koch’s postulates may not be sufficient to describe the role of the microbiota in disease. "
"20","disease","In this scenario, a more successful, albeit still suboptimal, consequence of altered intestinal/microbiota relationship would be the maintenance of ‘‘low-grade’’ inflammation that correlates with diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancer, whose effects generally do not manifest during one’s prime reproductive years. "
"21","disease","Another possibility suggested by our results is that some IBD-associated bacteria such as AIEC strain LF82 may not merely colonize the gut as a consequence of disease and/or be an aggravating factor of established disease but rather might play an early role in disease pathogenesis, particularly as instigators of inflammation. "
"22","disease","Should either general developmental microbiota volatility or select bacterial taxa correlate with future disease development, it would suggest that the possibility of therapeutic manipulations of the microbiota, particularlyFigure 7. "

"
"40","environment","The underlying cause(s) of the disturbance is not well defined but clearly involves both environmental and genetic factors. "
"41","environment","Prominent among environmental factors is the gut microbiota, in that IBD has been associated with broad changes in composition of the microbiota in general and with select bacterial strains that have been suggested to be opportunistic pathogens (Dupont and Dupont, 2011). "
"42","environment","That analogous observations have been made with murine models of colitis (e.g., IL-10 KO [Matharu et al., 2009; Sellon et al., 1998]) provides broad support for the notion that the composition of the gut microbiota is an important environmental determinant of colitis, but such approaches of complete microbiota exchange or ablation have not been especially informative in defining which changes are closely correlated with colitis development, nor do they shed much light on underlying mechanism. "
"43","environment","Consistent with the notion that gut microbiota is acquired from one’s early environment, overall microbiota composition was similar in the early postweaning period in T5KO mice that developed colitis and their littermates that did not. "
"44","human","For example, a number of studies of IBD in humans have described a functional class of Escherichia coli referred to as adherentinvasive E. coli (AIEC) (Darfeuille-Michaud, 2002). "
"45","human","While E. coli, in general, is a fairly common component of the human microbiota, AIEC were identified as E. coli that had seemingly reached inappropriate locations either adherent to, within, or beyond the gut epithelium, whereas the vast majority of gut microbiota are not in direct contact with cells but, rather, are clearly physically separated by the mucus layer; i.e., glycocalyx (Derrien et al., 2010). "
"46","human","As an initial attempt to obviate this concern, we treated WT and noncolitic T5KO mice with streptomycin (to ‘‘level the field’’) and then challenged them with an enterobacteria species associated with CD in humans, namely AIEC reference strain LF82. "
"47","human","We anticipate that ongoing development of fecal sample banks that catalog specimens throughout life on persons who develop IBD and control subjects will make it possible to better address if such instigator bacteria exist in humans who eventually develop chronic gut inflammation. "
