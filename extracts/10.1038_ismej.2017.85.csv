"
"2","wild","Here, we investigated the genetic relatedness, root phenotypic traits and rhizobacterial community composition of modern and wild accessions of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown in agricultural soil from the highlands of Colombia, one of the centers of common bean diversification. "
"3","wild","Diversity Array Technology-based genotyping and phenotyping of local common bean accessions showed significant genetic and root architectural differences between wild and modern accessions, with a higher specific root length for the wild accessions. "
"4","wild","Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that the divergence in rhizobacterial community composition between wild and modern bean accessions is associated with differences in specific root length. "
"5","wild","Along the bean genotypic trajectory, going from wild to modern, we observed a gradual decrease in relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, mainly Chitinophagaceae and Cytophagaceae, and an increase in relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, in particular Nocardioidaceae and Rhizobiaceae, respectively. "
"6","wild","Plant domestication was essential to human history but also resulted in a significant reduction in genetic diversity of crop species as compared to their wild ancestors (Doebley et al., 2006). "
"7","wild","Received 16 December 2016; revised 23 February 2017; accepted 14 April 2017; published online 6 June 2017 The ISME Journal (2017) 11, 2244–2257 © 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved 1751-7362/17 www.nature.com/ismej been affected in modern cultivars of plants as compared to their wild ancestors (Bulgarelli et al., 2015; Leff et al., 2016; Pérez-Jaramillo et al., 2016). "
"8","wild","In this context, wild relatives and also landraces have been proposed to provide valuable new insight into plant traits and genes associated with microbiome assembly, allowing an integral role of microbiome assembly in future plant breeding programs. "
"9","wild","Here, we determined the genetic relatedness and root morphological traits of wild and modern accessions of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and analyzed their rhizosphere microbiome composition. "
"10","wild","This wide distribution led to geographical isolation of wild common bean and resulted in well-characterized genetic pools (Gepts and Bliss, 1985). "
"11","wild","A vast collection of available accessions, ranging from wild relatives to highly productive modern varieties, makes common bean a good model system to investigate the impact of domestication on root phenotypic traits and on rhizobacterial community composition of an economically important food crop. "
"12","wild","In this study, we adopted the approach of ‘going back to the roots’ (Pérez-Jaramillo et al., 2016) and selected eight Colombian accessions of common bean, including wild relatives, landraces and modern cultivars and characterized their genetic relatedness by Diversity Array Technology (Jaccoud et al., 2001). "
"13","wild","Colombian mountains are considered an important center of common bean diversification where wild and landraces of common bean from the two main genetic pools (Mesoamerican and Andean) can still be found in their natural habitats (Gepts and Bliss, 1986). "
"14","wild","Materials and methods Selection of common bean accessions and Colombian soil Two wild, three landraces and three improved varieties (modern cultivars) of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were selected based on the following characteristics: they belong to the Colombian Mesoamerican genetic pool; landraces and modern accessions are the same race, they exhibit the Mesoamerican phaseolin protein type; they originate from the same altitudinal range; and they have the same growth type (that is, climbing instead of bushy). "
"15","wild","The accession G51283K1 was compared with the whole genomes of G22304 and landrace G23998 as wild accessions, with modern accessions G5773 and G51695 as modern accessions and with landrace G50632I1. "
"16","wild","Bean accessions G22304 and G23998, originally selected for this study as wild and landrace, respectively, showed strong genetic concordance and were classified as wild or ‘Ancestral’ accessions A1 and A2, respectively (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1). "
"17","wild","For the accession G51283K1, selected originally as a wild, a genome-wide comparison showed that it is more similar to the modern bean accessions than to the wild accessions (Supplementary Figure S2). "
"18","wild","We postulate that G51283K1 is probably a weedy accession, that is, the product of a cross between wild common bean and a modern cultivar (Toro et al., 1990). "
"19","wild","Inference of the genetic diversity of the selected bean accessions further supported our classification: accessions M1–M5 have a higher number of homozygous segments and higher inbreeding coefficients than landrace L1 and wild accessions A1 and A2 (Figures 1d and e). "
"20","wild","Accessions A1 and A2 originate from the same geographic area where several wild relatives of common bean have been collected (Blair et al., 2012) (Figure 1a). "
"21","wild","The proximity between collection sites might partly explain the genotypic similarities between these two wild accessions. "
"22","wild","Root phenotypic traits of wild and modern bean accessions Wild accessions A1 and A2 had a similar specific root length (SRL: ratio of root length and dry weight) and a similar root density (ratio of dry weight and volume), different from the other bean accessions (Figure 2). "
"23","wild","These results confirm and extend earlier results found for wild common bean as compared to cultivars (Martín-Robles et al., 2015). "
"24","wild","Taken together, a high SRL and small diameter point to thinner roots and may provide a higher efficiency of water search and uptake, traits that are important for wild beans to prosper and survive in the dry native habitats (Toro et al. "
"25","wild","A Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis further confirmed that the genetic make-up of the wild bean accessions correlates with their rhizobacterial community composition (Supplementary Figure S7). "
"26","wild","The phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were significantly more abundant in the rhizosphere of the wild bean accessions, whereas the Actinobacteria were more abundant in the rhizosphere of the modern bean accessions (FDRo0.1; Figures 4a and b). "
"27","wild","Intriguingly, Bacteroidetes have also been reported at higher relative abundance in the rhizosphere of other wild plant species and wild crop relatives, including Cardamine hirsuta (Schlaeppi et al., 2014), Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima (Zachow et al., 2014) and Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum (Bulgarelli et al., 2015). "
"28","wild","Considering the increased abundance of Bacteroidetes on the thin roots of wild relatives of common bean and the higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria on the thicker roots of modern varieties, it is tempting to Figure 5 Differential abundance of bacterial OTUs between the wild bean accession A1 and modern bean accession M5. "
"29","wild","The color of the circles represents the OTUs enriched in the rhizosphere of wild accession A1 (green) or of modern accession M5 (red), with the assigned Genus in italics. "
"30","wild","Whether the association with Bacteroidetes might result in a healthier development for plants as shown for animals, and whether its increased abundance on the roots of the wild relatives is a signature of coevolution remains speculative and opens exciting Figure 6 Constrained Canonical Correspondence Analysis of 16S sequence data and root morphological traits. (a) Root morphological traits as explanatory variables for the divergence between the overall rhizobacterial community composition of the eight different bean accessions. "
"31","wild","Green triangles represent the replicates of the wild bean accessions A1 and A2, blue squares represent the landrace accession L1, and red circles represent the modern bean accessions M1–M5. "
"32","wild","More specifically, the putative link between the abundance of this bacterial Phylum in the rhizosphere of wild crop relatives and its ability to degrade complex biopolymers (Thomas et al., 2011) will be subject of future experiments. "
"33","wild","Interestingly, the dissimilarities between wild accessions A1 and A2 appears to be largely driven by the number of nodules. "
"34","wild","The phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were consistently more abundant in the rhizosphere of wild common bean accessions, whereas representatives of the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were enriched on roots of modern bean accessions. "
"35","wild","The divergence in rhizobacterial community composition between wild and modern bean accessions suggest a plant genetic basis of rhizosphere microbiome assembly. "
"36","wild","In our study, only wild bean accession A2 presented a higher number of nodules per root system, while no significant differences were found between the other bean accessions. "
"37","wild","The relatively small sample size used in our study precludes a statistically robust GWAS analysis but did provide a well differentiated set of traits in wild and modern accessions associated with a number of bacterial taxa. "
