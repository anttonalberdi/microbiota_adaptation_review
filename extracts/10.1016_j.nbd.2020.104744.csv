"1","wild","Ultrastructural analysis of myelin in the corpus callosum revealed alterations of myelin thickness in BACHD GF compared to specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice, whereas no differences were observed between wild-type (WT) groups. "
"2","wild","This relationship accounts for https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2020.104744 Received 4 September 2018; Received in revised form 2 February 2019; Accepted 20 February 2019 DOI of original article: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2019.02.011 Abbreviations: BACHD, bacterial artificial chromosome model of HD; CC, corpus callosum; GST-pi, Glutathione S-transferase; GF, germ-free; HD, Huntington disease; SPF, specific-pathogen free; HTT, huntingtin gene; MBP, myelin basic protein; OPC, oligodendrocyte precursor cells; PDGFRα, platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha; PFC, prefrontal cortex; PLP, proteolipid protein; WM, white matter; WT, wild-type; YAC128, yeast artificial chromosome model of HD ☆ A publisher's error resulted in this article appearing in the wrong issue. "
"3","wild","In addition, thinner myelin sheaths and lower levels of myelin-related gene transcripts were seen in these animals compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Teo et al., 2016). "
"4","wild","We hypothesised that the absence of microbiota differentially affects myelination in the BACHD mouse model of HD relative to wild-type controls. "
"5","wild","Thus, subtle effects may have been concealed by potential synchronisation of microbiota populations when cohousing wildtype and mutant littermates (Laukens et al., 2016). "
