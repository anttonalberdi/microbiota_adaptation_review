"1","wild","Ultrastructural analysis of myelin in the corpus callosum revealed alterations of myelin thickness in BACHD GF compared to specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice, whereas no differences were observed between wild-type (WT) groups. "

"3","wild","In addition, thinner myelin sheaths and lower levels of myelin-related gene transcripts were seen in these animals compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Teo et al., 2016). "
"4","wild","We hypothesised that the absence of microbiota differentially affects myelination in the BACHD mouse model of HD relative to wild-type controls. "
"5","wild","Thus, subtle effects may have been concealed by potential synchronisation of microbiota populations when cohousing wildtype and mutant littermates (Laukens et al., 2016). "
"6","mutant","Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing mutant HTT selectively in oligodendrocytes showed impaired myelination, with myelin thinning in the striatum, reduction of myelin basic protein gene expression, as well as progressive motor impairments, metabolic deficits and reduced survival (Huang et al., 2015). "
"7","mutant","Characterisation of microbiota population in SPF animals revealed minor shifts in commensal bacteria of BACHD compared to WT controls, suggesting that mutant HTT in BACHD mice does not cause any profound disturbances in gut microbiota. "
"8","mutant","Distinct gut microbiome-derived metabolites in the plasma of HD patients, therefore, suggested the mutant HTT may promote modifications in commensal gut bacteria. "

"13","model","In addition to the well-studied neuronal degeneration in the basal ganglia, white matter (WM) atrophy and myelination defects have been identified as early features of the HD phenotype in both patients and animal models. "
"14","model","Previous work in our laboratory has also explored the molecular and ultrastructural features of WM abnormalities in HD mouse and rat models (Garcia-Miralles et al., 2016; Teo et al., 2016; Garcia-Miralles et al., 2018). "
"15","model","For example, diffusion tensor imaging revealed WM microstructural abnormalities prior to neuronal loss in the CC of the YAC128 mouse model and the BACHD rat model (Teo et al., 2016). "
"16","model","Similar abnormalities have also been reported in the BACHD, HdhQ250 and R6/2 mouse models of HD (Wade et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2015). "
"17","model","We hypothesised that the absence of microbiota differentially affects myelination in the BACHD mouse model of HD relative to wild-type controls. "
"18","model","Samples were viewed and imaged using a Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin/ Biotwin TEM model (FEI), with the following imaging parameters: SA2550x for g-ratios, and SA11500x for periodicity. "
"19","model","Discussion We investigated the effects of microbiota manipulation on myelination and oligodendroglial population in the BACHD mouse model of HD and WT controls. "
"20","model","For example, studies using Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models have shown decreased (Minter et al., 2016) and increased (Harach et al., 2017) levels of microbiota diversity. "
"21","model","Consistent with our findings, Prevotella was previously reported to be decreased in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD (Shen et al., 2017) and in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse, which recapitulates the main characteristic of MS (Mangalam et al., 2017). "
"22","model","While this paper was under review, a study examining gut microbiota changes in the R6/1 model of HD was published (Kong et al., 2018). "
"23","model","This discrepancy may reflect biological differences related to the mouse strain or transgenic human HTT constructs harboured in the two models: FVB/N mice expressing human a full length HTT transgene expressing a HTT protein with 97 polyglutamines in the case of BACHD, compared with R6/1 mice on a mixed CBA x C57Bl/6 background expressing a 67 amino acid fragment of human HTT with 116 polyglutamines (Pouladi et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2018). "
"24","model","Indeed, sodium butyrate and phenylbutyrate intake rescued histone acetylation, prevented neuronal death, and extended the lifespan of several HD mouse models (Ferrante et al., 2003; Gardian et al., 2005). "
"25","model","However, the lack of profound differences in bacterial populations between the genotypes may suggest that defects in myelin plasticity observed in the BACHD mouse model are intrinsic and not related to preexisting differences in gut microbiota. "
