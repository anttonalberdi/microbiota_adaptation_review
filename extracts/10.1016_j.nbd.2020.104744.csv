"80","environment","T approximately 50–70% of the observed variance in clinical onset, with greater onset variance associated with lower CAG repeats, potentially due to a greater influence of genetic and environmental modifiers (Langbehn et al., 2004). "
"81","environment","It is therefore critical to investigate possible modulating environmental factors of plastic and adaptive processes contributing to HD pathology. "
"82","environment","In the present study, we used microbiota manipulation as an environmental intervention to investigate white matter plasticity in HD. "
"83","environment","Experimental design WT and BACHD transgenic mice on the FVB background were bred either under normal laboratory conditions (specific pathogen free, SPF) or in a germ-free environment (GF). "
"84","environment","Differential effects of microbiota manipulation on myelin and axonal characteristics in the CC of BACHD and WT animals To examine the effects of a germ-free environment on myelination in BACHD and WT animals, we elected to investigate ultrastructural myelin and axonal characteristics in the CC using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. "
"85","environment","This classification of g-ratios based on axonal calibre indicates thinner myelin for small axons in WT animals, and thicker myelin at all axonal calibre ranges for BACHD animals placed in a germ-free environment. "
"86","environment","On average myelin sheaths appeared to be thicker in BACHD animals housed in a GF environment, indicating that removing microbiota may contribute to hypermyelination. "
"87","environment","Decreased levels of myelin-related proteins in the PFC of mice raised in a germ-free environment In order to understand whether differences in myelin and axonal characteristics, observed at ultrastructural level correlate with changes at gene or protein level, candidate myelin-related genes and associated proteins were evaluated. "
"88","environment","These results suggest that decreased levels of compact myelin-related proteins, such as MBP and PLP in WT GF animals, may contribute to the increased periodicity of myelin sheaths as a result of the germ-free environment (summarised in Table 2). "
"89","environment","Ultrastructural analyses indicated that a GF environment had a greater effect on the extent of myelination and calibre of callosal axons in BACHD animals compared to WT controls, while possible decompaction of myelin lamellae was observed in both genotypes. "
"90","environment","Additionally, oligodendrocyte-specific cytoskeletal protein, Ermn, was also decreased in BACHD animals raised in a GF environment, and has been implicated to play a role in late wrapping and the compaction phase of myelination (Brockschnieder et al., 2006). "
"91","environment","It is also possible that the PFC might be particularly susceptible to microbiota-driven changes in a way that the CC is not, since myelination in the PFC has been previously speculated to be particularly plastic and susceptible to environmental factors (Tomlinson et al., 2016; Forbes and Gallo, 2017; Mount and Monje, 2017). "
"92","environment","This is further supported by observations of lack of differences in relative myelin-related protein expression in other brain regions, such as the frontal cortex (rather than the PFC), amygdala, cerebellum, hippocampus or striatum, as result of a GF environment, although ultrastructural myelin characteristics in these regions were notably not investigated (Hoban et al., 2016). "
"93","environment","Our results suggest that while OPC numbers may be unaffected, the proportion of OPCs that differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes may be lower in a GF environment. "
"94","environment","Thus, it is possible that the ability of mature oligodendrocytes to myelinate is compromised in a GF environment, leading to the observed decompaction of myelin lamellae, and alterations in the levels of myelin-related proteins. "
"95","environment","Although mature oligodendrocytes were similarly affected by a GF environment in early manifest BACHD and WT animals, ultrastructural changes of myelinated axons were differentially expressed. "
"96","environment","These results suggest that the intrinsic pathological characteristics of BACHD mice may predispose these to myelination-related alterations due to environmental manipulations, such as gut microbiota depletion through GF housing. "
