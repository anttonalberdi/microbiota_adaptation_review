"1","wild","The results show that overfeeding and high-fat diet can induce obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in wild-type fish. "
"2","wild","Overfeeding with 12 times the amount of Artemia for 8 weeks induced obesity and increased pathophysiological pathways in wild-type zebrafish, similar to mammalian obesity [36]. "
"3","wild","We selected 30 samples for omics analysis using microarray (14 samples) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) (16 samples) to study the dynamic changes of pathways from normal diet (NOR), overfeeding (DIO) using diet-induced obesity, and high-fat-diet (FAT) treatment in four fish types: wild-type (WT), overexpression of hepatitis B virus X antigen (HBx) with p53 mutation (HBx(p53-)), overexpression of Src with p53 mutation (Src(p53-)), Cancers 2019, 11, 1899 3 of 22 and overexpression of both HBx and Src with p53 mutation (HBx,Src(p53-)). "
"4","wild","For the wild-type, HBx(p53-), and Src(p53-) fish, the average weight from FAT was more significant compared with normal diet and DIO. "
"5","wild","With a normal diet, the weight of the wild-type fish was the highest; in the DIO group, the weight of the Src(p53-) fish was the highest; in the FAT group, the weight of HBx(p53-) fish was the highest (Figure S1A). "
"6","wild","Impact of Genetic Factors on Steatosis and Cell Proliferation In HBx(p53-) and Src(p53-) normal feeding (NOR) fish for two months (equivalent to five-month-old fish), the expression of lipogenic enzyme or factors was higher than that of wild-type, and there was a significant or extremely significant difference (Figure S2A,B). "
"7","wild","In wild-type fish after eight weeks of feeding, for the lipogenic enzyme, DIO did not cause differences in the expression of agpat and pap, but decreased the expression of fasn. "
"8","wild","We found that a high-fat diet and overfeeding can induce obesity and steatosis in wild-type fish by increasing the expression of genes involved in fat synthesis, and the change was more significant when there were no genetic risk factors. "
"9","wild","We followed the diet-induced-obesity method and fed wild-type, HBx(p53-), Src(p53-), and HBx, Src(p53-) fish with 12 times the amount of Artemia or a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. "
"10","mutant","We demonstrated that HBx and SRC overexpression induced hepatocarcinogenesis in p53 mutant zebrafish [6]. "
"11","mutant","Our results suggest that the impact of genetic factors on steatosis was more significant in the overexpression of HBx and Src alone in p53 mutant background. "
"12","mutant","With the combination of HBx and Src in p53 mutant, the hepatocyte seems forwarded from overexpressing lipogenic enzyme/factors to cell cycle/proliferation, and we suspect the overexpression of oncogene-induced carcinogenesis. "
"13","mutant","Liver-specific expressions of HBx and src in the p53 mutant trigger hepatocarcinogenesis in zebrafish. "
"14","model","In the HBx-induced HCC mouse model, SRC was identified as a common regulator [9]. "
"15","model","Therefore, we generated a transgenic zebrafish model to reflect the genetic signature in human HCC patients. "
"16","model","Zebrafish is a vertebrate model with high relevance to humans; approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue [23]. "
"17","model","The well-developed gene transfer technology has boosted zebrafish as a prevalent research model in different research fields including human diseases, cancer studies, and drug screening [24–26]. "

"19","model","Zebrafish cancer models could be part of preclinical precision medicine approaches [28]. "
"20","model","Due to the functional conservation in lipid metabolism, lipid biology, and glucose homeostasis, zebrafish have become a model for obesity and diabetes [34], and a great model for geneticand diet-induced adiposity [35]. "
"21","model","However, most of these studies lacked a global omics-based approach for a comprehensive analysis of obesity/NASH to HCC in the zebrafish model. "
"22","model","To investigate the synergistic mechanism of obesity/NASH/HCC in zebrafish models with three diet and four genetic risk factors, we developed an integrated omics computational model to examine their related genes, pathways, subsystems, and systems. "
"23","model","We believe that the observed mechanisms of interactions and the establishment of accelerated liver disease zebrafish models for drug screening can be of benefit to people. "

"35","model","The direct role of ACAT2 linked to hepatic steatosis and glucose homeostasis was also proved in the mouse model [44]. "
"36","model","Our global omics data analysis identified genes are connected to glucose and lipid metabolism also participating in NASH from the WT fish diet-induced obesity model (Figure 7L), and those genes might be potential drug targets for prevention of NASH, obesity and HCC. "
"37","model","When we compared the HCC biology from different models, we saw the HBx, Src(p53-) diet-induced obesity for 8 weeks exhibited the most intensive HCC characteristics with more hepatocytes developed HCC. "
"38","model","Using a mouse model fed with high-fat-non-cholesterol versus high-fat-high-cholesterol, scientists have found high-cholesterol promotes NASH development. "
"39","model","Another female mice model fed with Western diet (WD)-induced NASH increased the expression of genes, including steatosis (SFA, MUFA, MUFA-containing diand triacylglycerol), inflammation (TNFα), oxidative stress (Ncf2), and fibrosis (Col1A) via lipidomics and transcriptomic approach [55].
