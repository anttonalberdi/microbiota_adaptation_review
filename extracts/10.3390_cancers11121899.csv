"1","wild","The results show that overfeeding and high-fat diet can induce obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in wild-type fish. "
"2","wild","Overfeeding with 12 times the amount of Artemia for 8 weeks induced obesity and increased pathophysiological pathways in wild-type zebrafish, similar to mammalian obesity [36]. "
"3","wild","We selected 30 samples for omics analysis using microarray (14 samples) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) (16 samples) to study the dynamic changes of pathways from normal diet (NOR), overfeeding (DIO) using diet-induced obesity, and high-fat-diet (FAT) treatment in four fish types: wild-type (WT), overexpression of hepatitis B virus X antigen (HBx) with p53 mutation (HBx(p53-)), overexpression of Src with p53 mutation (Src(p53-)), Cancers 2019, 11, 1899 3 of 22 and overexpression of both HBx and Src with p53 mutation (HBx,Src(p53-)). "
"4","wild","For the wild-type, HBx(p53-), and Src(p53-) fish, the average weight from FAT was more significant compared with normal diet and DIO. "
"5","wild","With a normal diet, the weight of the wild-type fish was the highest; in the DIO group, the weight of the Src(p53-) fish was the highest; in the FAT group, the weight of HBx(p53-) fish was the highest (Figure S1A). "
"6","wild","Impact of Genetic Factors on Steatosis and Cell Proliferation In HBx(p53-) and Src(p53-) normal feeding (NOR) fish for two months (equivalent to five-month-old fish), the expression of lipogenic enzyme or factors was higher than that of wild-type, and there was a significant or extremely significant difference (Figure S2A,B). "
"7","wild","In wild-type fish after eight weeks of feeding, for the lipogenic enzyme, DIO did not cause differences in the expression of agpat and pap, but decreased the expression of fasn. "
"8","wild","We found that a high-fat diet and overfeeding can induce obesity and steatosis in wild-type fish by increasing the expression of genes involved in fat synthesis, and the change was more significant when there were no genetic risk factors. "
"9","wild","We followed the diet-induced-obesity method and fed wild-type, HBx(p53-), Src(p53-), and HBx, Src(p53-) fish with 12 times the amount of Artemia or a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. "
