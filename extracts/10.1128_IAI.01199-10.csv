"
"2","wild","This intestine-adapted strain (E. coli MG1655*) grew faster on several different carbon sources than the wild type and was nonmotile due to deletion of the flhD gene. "
"3","wild","The results show that intestine-adapted E. coli MG1655* is more fit than the wild type for intestinal colonization, because loss of FlhD results in elevated expression of genes involved in carbon and energy metabolism, resulting in more efficient carbon source utilization and a higher intestinal population. "
"4","wild","A few years ago, we isolated a spontaneous mutant of wild-type E. coli K-12, strain MG1655, following passage through the intestine of a streptomycintreated mouse, which is a better colonizer than its wild-type parent strain (31). "
"5","wild","This intestine-adapted strain (E. coli MG1655*) grew faster on several different carbon sources than the wild type and was nonmotile due to deletion of the flhD gene (31). "
"6","wild","Thus, there were two possible explanations for why E. coli MG1655* grows faster than the wild-type on several carbon sources. "
"7","wild","In the wild-type E. coli MG1655 strain, an insertion element (IS1) immediately upstream of flhD increases promoter activity, causing hypermotility and strong repression of some carbohydrate metabolism genes (2). "
"8","wild","Our results show that the intestine-adapted E. coli MG1655* strain is more fit than the wild type for intestinal colonization, because loss of FlhD causes elevated expression of genes involved in carbon and energy metabolism, resulting in enhanced metabolic efficiency, which is pivotal for success in host colonization. "
"9","wild","Streptomycin-treated mice were used to study competition in the intestine between streptomycin-resistant wild-type E. coli and the isogenic flhD mutant strain. "
"10","wild","Dilutions were plated on lactose MacConkey agar containing streptomycin sulfate (100 g/ml) and nalidixic acid (Nal; 50 g/ml) to distinguish the wild-type E. coli MG1655 Strr Nalr strain from the E. coli MG1655 Strr flhD::cat strain, which was plated on MacConkey agar containing streptomycin sulfate (100 g/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 g/ml). "
"11","wild","The nalidixic acid and chloramphenicol resistance markers used to distinguish the wild-type from the flhD mutant have no effect on its colonization ability (39). "
"12","wild","We previously showed that E. coli MG1655* grows 6 to 23% faster on several different sugars and about 15% faster on cecal mucus, as sole carbon and energy sources, than its wild-type parent. "
"13","wild","Moreover, E. coli MG1655* has a colonization advantage over the wild type (31). "
"14","wild","We also found that the E. coli MG1655 flhD mutant grows faster that its wild-type parent on a mixture of 10 different sugars known to be present in mouse cecal mucus (19). "
"15","wild","Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether the E. coli MG1655 flhD mutant is a better colonizer than the wild type. "
"16","wild","To test this possibility, groups of 3 CD-1 mice were treated for 24 h with streptomycin (5 mg/ml) in their drinking water to open a niche for experimental colonization, and then the mice were fed 105 CFU each of the E. coli MG1655 flhD::cat Strr strain and the E. coli MG1655 Strr Nalr wild type; the Cmr cassette was used to enumerate the E. coli MG1655 flhD::cat population, and the Nalr cassette was used to count the wild-type population. "
"17","wild","As shown in Fig. 1, the E. coli MG1655 Strr flhD mutant had about a 2-log (100-fold)-higher population than the E. coli MG1655 Strr Nalr wild type. "
"18","wild","Wild-type E. coli MG1655 has an IS1 element within its flhD regulatory region that increases transcription of the flhDC operon, resulting in increased production of the flagellar master regulator, which causes wild-type E. coli MG1655 to be hypermotile (2). "
"19","wild","(Top) Competition of the E. coli MG1655 flhD mutant against the E. coli MG1655 wild type in the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine. "
"20","wild","Loss of the GlpR repressor would cause increased expression of this pathway, and indeed glpT and glpC were significantly induced in E. coli MG1655* compared to in the wild type (see below), but other members of the GlpR regulon were repressed, so it is not clear how these differences could provide a colonization advantage over the wild type. "
"21","wild","Previously, we established that intestine-adapted E. coli grows 6 to 23% faster on several sugars (31), suggesting the possibility that flhD deletion strains express sugar catabolism genes at higher levels than wild-type E. coli. "
"22","wild","To interrogate the transcriptome of E. coli MG1655* and to compare it to the wild-type and flhD deletion strains, cultures were grown to mid-logarithmic phase on MOPS minimal glucose medium. "
"23","wild","To address the possibility that differences in its transcriptome cause E. coli MG1655* to grow faster on several sugars, we evaluated the expression levels of carbon catabolism gene systems by comparison to the wild-type parent strain, when grown on glucose minimal medium. "
"24","wild","To quantify the differences in expression of the catabolic regulons between E. coli MG1655* and the wild type, the expression ratios of the individual genes in each regulon were averaged, as shown in Fig. "
"25","wild","Overall, the average log2 expression ratio of the 23 regulons was 0.41 higher (1.3-fold) in the intestine-adapted strain than in the wild type. "
"26","wild","The modest yet consistently higher expression of catabolic regulons appeared to be significant, as the average log2 expression ratio for all known regulons (RegulonDB) was 0.06, with 100 regulons expressed higher in E. coli MG1655* and 72 regulons expressed higher in the wild type (data not shown). "
"27","wild","Thus, a simple transcriptome comparison of E. coli MG1655* and its wild-type parent revealed a general, modest increase in the transcript levels of genes involved in nutrient uptake and catabolism, including the 23 regulons of interest. "
"28","wild","Average regulon gene expression for carbon catabolism genes in E. coli MG1655* by comparison to the wild type. "
"29","wild","To evaluate the statistical probability that specific transcription factors are responsible for the observed transcriptional differences between the E. coli MG1655* and wild-type strains, we applied Fisher’s exact test, employing a two-tailed hypergeometric distribution to identify enriched transcription factors in RegulonDB that are overrepresented in the transcription data. "
"30","wild","To test the hypothesis that the flhD deletion in E. coli MG1655* is solely responsible for the transcription patterns detailed above, we constructed an isogenic strain in the same wild-type E. coli MG1655 genetic background by replacing the flhD allele with a Cmr cassette. "
"31","wild","We tested this hypothesis by using Fisher’s exact test to analyze the regulatory networks that contributed the most significant differences between the E. coli MG1655* and E. coli MG1655 flhD mutant strains, in comparison to the wild-type control arrays. "
"32","wild","The correlation between the E. coli MG1655* and E. coli MG1655 flhD arrays was 0.962, which compares favorably to the correlation between replicate control arrays (wild type) of 0.964 (data not shown). "
"33","wild","Catabolome of an intestine-adapted strain compared to that of the wild type grown in glucose. "
"34","wild","The E. coli MG1655* and wild-type strains were essentially equal in the number of carbon sources utilized. "
"35","wild","However, we found that E. coli MG1655* oxidized 24 carbon sources to a greater extent than the wild-type parent strain (see Fig. "
"36","wild","We found the IS1 deletion strain had an intermediate level of carbon source oxidation compared to that of E. coli MG1655* and the wild type. "
"37","wild","Therefore, the overall extent of carbon source oxidation was highest in strains lacking FlhDC (the E. coli MG1655 flhDC strain and E. coli MG1655*) and lowest in the wild-type strain (E. coli MG1655), which is hypermotile and overexpresses FlhDC. "

"
"39","wild","DISCUSSION Passage of E. coli MG1655 through the GI tract of the streptomycin-treated mouse selected for a strain that differed from the wild type in being more fit for colonization (31). "
"40","wild","We subsequently found that the intestine-adapted strain, E. coli MG1655*, acquired a deletion of the flhD gene that rendered it nonmotile and able to grow 6 to 23% faster than its wild-type parent in laboratory cultures on several sugars and on mouse cecal mucus (31). "
"41","wild","Second, the energy normally used by the wild type to synthesize flagella and power the flagellar motor was redirected to E. coli MG1655* growth (19). "
"42","wild","These genome-wide increases are of the same order of magnitude as the 6 to 23% higher growth rates on several carbon sources previously observed in laboratory cultures (19), which we propose to result in the 100-fold-higher intestinal population during competition against the wild type (Fig. "
"43","wild","As we noted, the vast majority of genes that showed altered expression in E. coli MG1655* compared to that of the wild type are under Crp control. "
"44","wild","In seeking to explain why E. coli MG1655* is a better colonizer, we note that deletion of flhD does not expand its catabolic capacity to include additional carbon sources not used by the wild type. "
"45","wild","The plot shows the overall extent of carbon source oxidation for wild-type E. coli MG1655 (“0.5 WT” indicates that one-half of the biomass was used compared to “1.0 WT”), strains deleted for IS1 (IS1) and flhD (flhDC mutant), and the intestine-adapted strain (MG1655*). "
"46","fitness","Second, loss of flhD could cause upregulation of genes unrelated to motility, i.e., catabolic genes, that enhance colonization fitness (19). "
"47","fitness","For these reasons, we were interested in determining the extent of changes to the E. coli MG1655* genome and whether or not the flhD deletion alone is sufficient to explain its enhanced colonization fitness. "
"48","fitness","RESULTS Colonization fitness advantage of the E. coli MG1655 flhD mutant. "
"49","fitness","Therefore, we sequenced the genome of intestine-adapted E. coli MG1655* to determine whether the flhD mutation is solely responsible for its colonization fitness advantage or if additional mutations occurred during animal passage. "
"50","fitness","Given that PCR mapping places the common endpoint of other flhD deletions obtained by animal passage in the same region adjacent to the insB locus (19), we propose that the corresponding gap in the E. coli MG1655* genome sequence is due to a deletion promoted by the IS1 element and selected because it confers a colonization fitness advantage. "
"51","fitness","The former is a pseudogene, and the latter is unlikely to affect gene function; therefore, these three putative mutations are unlikely to impact colonization fitness. "
"52","fitness","Since the data shown in Fig. 1 are consistent with the hypothesis that an isogenic flhD mutant has a colonization advantage over E. coli MG1655 analogous to that of the intestine-adapted strain (31), we conclude that the flhD deletion is solely responsible for the colonization fitness advantage of E. coli MG1655*. "
"53","fitness","First, mutational analysis showed that the flhD deletion apparently altered expression of genes not involved in motility that conferred enhanced colonization fitness. "
"54","fitness","To confirm that the observed colonization fitness advantage resulted from deletion of flhD, we sequenced the E. coli MG1655* genome and used high-throughput approaches to characterize phenotypes relevant to its enhanced carbon catabolism. "
"55","fitness","Therefore, it is more likely that the enhanced expression and activity of catabolic pathways is responsible for the colonization fitness advantage of the intestine-adapted strain. "
"56","fitness","Conversely, in many cases, we found that genetic lesions in metabolic pathways resulted in decreased colonization fitness (7, 15). "
"57","adaptat","In addition, the FlhDC master regulon controller is linked to catabolite repression control (57), adaptation to growth on acetate or propionate catabolism (48), and sugar acid catabolism (49, 55). "

"72","mutant","To test directly the hypothesis that the genotypic changes to the E. coli MG1655* genome, other than the flhD deletion, did not contribute to its colonization advantage, we fed E. coli MG1655* and the E. coli MG1655 flhD mutant to mice. "
"73","mutant","As expected, we show in Fig. 1 that the two strains cocolonized, which indicates that E. coli MG1655* and the E. coli MG1655 flhD mutant are identical in their ability to compete in the mouse intestine. "
"74","mutant","Since the data shown in Fig. 1 are consistent with the hypothesis that an isogenic flhD mutant has a colonization advantage over E. coli MG1655 analogous to that of the intestine-adapted strain (31), we conclude that the flhD deletion is solely responsible for the colonization fitness advantage of E. coli MG1655*.
