"
"3","wild","The relatively low pH and ammonia concentration in wild boar/pig hybrids may be caused by the low level of crude protein in diet of these animals. "
"4","wild","The hindgut fermentation pattern in wild boar/pig hybrids generally resembled that described earlier in domestic pigs, although some observed dissimilarities may be caused by distinct microbial activity. "
"5","wild","An important source of genetic variation may be breeding of hybrids between wild and domestic animals (Razmaite et al. 2009), which is becoming increasingly common in many countries. "
"6","wild","For example, hybrids between wild 507 Czech J. "
"7","wild","The wild boar/pig hybrids (WBPHs) are similar to wild boars in appearance and more resistant to harmful environmental factors than pigs. "
"8","wild","Similarly to pigs and wild boars, WBPHs are hindgut fermenters, in which the microbial processes occur in the colon and caecum. "
"9","wild","The volume of the large intestine per 1 kg of metabolic body weight in WBPHs (75% of wild boar genes, 25% of Polish Large White pig genes) is more than twice as large as in fatteners (Polish Large White × Duroc × Hampshire pig) (Leroch et al. "
"10","wild","The digestive tracts of nine WBPHs of the generation BC1 having 75% of wild boar blood and 25% of Pietrain pig blood were used in the study. "

"13","wild","Additionally, our results show SCFA concentrations similar to those in caecum and colon of wild boars (PeckaKielb et al. "
"14","wild","The molar ratio of acetate : propionate : butyrate in the large intestine of animals, such as horses, sheep, pigs, and various wild species, has been found to approximate 70 : 20 : 10 (Bergman 1990). "
"15","wild","In fresh caecal and colon ingesta of wild boars, butyrate proportions were similar to those obtained in pigs, but propionate proportions were lower from pigs and WBPHs and reached 10–13 mol% (Pecka-Kielb et al. "
"16","wild","These differences may be caused by less abundant microorganisms with the potential to produce propionate in wild boar and WBPHs (and butyrate in WBPHs), but may also be the result of lower activity of these microorganisms caused by different diets. "
"17","wild","The 12-hour in vitro incubation of wild boar caecal and colon inocula resulted in even lower ammonia production compared to WBPHs, which also remained unaffected by the wheat bran addition (Pecka-Kielb et al. "
"18","wild","It seems to be closer to pig’s than wild boar’s methane production which was lower and did not exceed 5 mmol/kg of intestinal content (Pecka-Kielb et al. "
