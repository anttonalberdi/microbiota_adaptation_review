"
"2","wild","In this study we focus on the gut flora of two groups of an endangered species, Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), wild group (WG) which is compared with that of the individuals of the same species but kept in the captivities (CG), a control group. "
"3","wild","Thus, this study indicates that the Firmicutes-rich gut microbiota in the WG enables individuals to maximize their energy intake from the cellulose, and has significant abundance of Euryarchaeota and methanogenesis pathways that allow them to reduce redundant energy consumption in methane metabolism, ensuring them to adapt to the wild environments.

"5","wild","Thus, artificial feeding wild animals during the program of ex situ conservation have to be modified on their dietary selection adopted in the wild, despite humans attempt to simulate wild diets for them. "
"6","wild","In other words, there exist a great variety in the richness of the dietary components between the animal groups living in the wild and the captivities. "
"7","wild","Thus, it is critical to monitor digestive system of the animals in the captivities in order to know whether they have adapted to artificial food provisioned and new environment – an important issue in wildlife conservation (Murray et al., 2016). "
"8","wild","It is reported that some wild animal populations raised by the artificial program to avoid declining population size have to change their digestive system following the modification of dietary components that are different from those taken from the wild. "
"9","wild","This kind of artificial food feeding is based on previous experience rather than on the diet of wild populations (Xie, 2011). "
"10","wild","The CG diet, different from those from the wild, has a higher proportion of carbohydrate, but lower level of fibers (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). "
"11","wild","Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) are rapidly disappearing in the wild. "
"12","wild","We are, however, facing the problems of how to maintain appropriate food components that can keep their normal nutrition adopted in the wild, and a healthy digestive system naturally selected through environmental adaptation (Zhu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016). "
"13","wild","Compared to the wild condition, the captive group obviously is provisioned more food and even high energy items, but diversity of provisioned food seems to be less than the nature food. "
"14","wild","In this regard, the microbiota of wild group can provide a good indicator that tells the direction of provision artificial food (Gorvitovskaia et al., 2016; Hale et al., 2017). "
"15","wild","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Fecal Sample Collection Thirty-seven fecal samples were collected totally: fourteen from 14 individuals in Xinglongshan Alpine musk deer farm and 23 from 23 wild individuals in the Mts. "
"16","wild","The estimated population size of wild group is less than 100 individuals (Yang et al., 2003). "
"17","wild","We found that musk deer shared similar main community constituents, both wild and domesticated groups. "
"18","wild","Therefore, the ability to absorb nutrients from high-fiber foods is the key to the survival of wild musk deer, and high F/B ratios in gut microbiota are clearly of great significance. "
"19","wild","The significant enrichment of fiber-degrading bacteria in the wild population corresponds to its higher fiber feeding, indicating that the intestinal microbes play an active role in helping the host to absorb nutrients and adapt to the environment. "
"20","wild","Enrichment of methane metabolic pathways and the increase of methanogens in captive individuals, show that captive individuals are more dependent on methane metabolic pathways, while wild individuals are enriched in acetogens and functional gene deletions in methane production pathways, showing more dependence on acetogens for hydrogen utilization. "
"21","wild","From the wild to the captivity, the changes in the flora function caused by different diet directly lead to an increase in the level of methane metabolism, which affects the efficiency of the energy absorption. "
"22","wild","To improve captivity-based breeding programs more experiments are still required to search for ideal ways of narrowing the gap between wild and captivity group in terms of dietary selection, which would play in important role in musk deer conservation. "
"23","wild","The gut microbiota appears to compensate for seasonal diet variation in the wild black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). "

"27","adaptat","Such phenomenon allows the hosts to adapt to environmental changes under the principles and regulations of natural selection and environmental adaptation. "
"28","adaptat","We are, however, facing the problems of how to maintain appropriate food components that can keep their normal nutrition adopted in the wild, and a healthy digestive system naturally selected through environmental adaptation (Zhu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016).

"30","disease","Control group usually faces a high risk of disease, especially gastrointestinal ones which have a high mortality rates (Yan et al., 2016). "
"31","disease","The species richness and structure of the intestinal microbiota can often reflect the health status of the body, and disease may be caused by abnormal flora, while some species help resist the occurrence of some intestinal diseases. "
"32","disease","Another important biomarker of CG, Treponema, is a genus of spiral-shaped bacteria, whose subspecies are responsible for diseases such as syphilis, bejel, and yaws (Antal et al., 2002). "
"33","disease","Alpine Musk Deer Gut Microbiota FIGURE 5 | Comparison of methanobacteriaceae relative abundance between CG and WG. shows that gastrointestinal diseases are the most common and have high mortality rates, reaching approximately 30% (Li et al., 2017). "

"
"40","environment","Alpine Musk Deer Gut Microbiota INTRODUCTION Intestinal microbiology of the mammals is frequently shaped by many factors, including dietary selection, phylogenic development, and environmental modifications (Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Schnorr et al., 2014; Clemente et al., 2015). "
"41","environment","Thus, it is critical to monitor digestive system of the animals in the captivities in order to know whether they have adapted to artificial food provisioned and new environment – an important issue in wildlife conservation (Murray et al., 2016). "
"42","environment","Such phenomenon allows the hosts to adapt to environmental changes under the principles and regulations of natural selection and environmental adaptation. "
"43","environment","We are, however, facing the problems of how to maintain appropriate food components that can keep their normal nutrition adopted in the wild, and a healthy digestive system naturally selected through environmental adaptation (Zhu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016). "
"44","environment","Only fresh fecal samples are collected from the fecal center to avoid environmental contamination on the surface. "
"45","environment","The significant enrichment of fiber-degrading bacteria in the wild population corresponds to its higher fiber feeding, indicating that the intestinal microbes play an active role in helping the host to absorb nutrients and adapt to the environment. "
"46","environment","Referring to the results found in this study, it is clear that the impacts caused by different dietary selection and living environment, which have resulted in different intestinal flora of musk deer, are remarkable. "
"47","environment","Meanwhile the proportion of dietary fibers should be appropriately increased to help musk deer maintain a stable and health intestinal flora under artificial environment. "
"48","human","Thus, artificial feeding wild animals during the program of ex situ conservation have to be modified on their dietary selection adopted in the wild, despite humans attempt to simulate wild diets for them. "
"49","human","A study on the associations between gut microbes and nutrient absorption in humans has presented stool energy loss in lean individuals, and a 20% increase of Firmicutes and a corresponding decrease of Bacteroidetes are associated with an increased energy harvest of 150 kcal (Jumpertz et al., 2011). "
"50","human","Another research on captive primates reports that, due to dietary changes, especially the decreased fiber components, primates lost substantial portions of signature microbiota in captivity, and they were colonized by humanassociated gut bacterial genera of Bacteroides and Prevotella, which lead to a decreased gut microbiota diversity (Clayton et al., 2016), implying an increased risk of intestinal disorders (Moeller et al., 2014). "
"51","human","Such result is also similar to that reported on captive primates, due to dietary changes, especially the decreased fiber components, microbiota in captive primates become colonized by human-associated gut bacterial genera Bacteroides and Prevotella (Clayton et al., 2016). "
"52","human","The two musk deer populations share a similar climate, so that we classify the factors under farm breeding, such as diet and sanitation as human intervention. "
"53","human","A study on the associations between gut microbes and nutrient absorption in humans has shown stool energy loss in lean individuals, such as a 20% increase in Firmicutes and a corresponding decreased of Bacteroidetes are associated with an increased energy harvest of 150 kcals (Jumpertz et al., 2011).
