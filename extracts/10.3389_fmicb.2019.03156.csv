"
"2","wild","In this study we focus on the gut flora of two groups of an endangered species, Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), wild group (WG) which is compared with that of the individuals of the same species but kept in the captivities (CG), a control group. "
"3","wild","Thus, this study indicates that the Firmicutes-rich gut microbiota in the WG enables individuals to maximize their energy intake from the cellulose, and has significant abundance of Euryarchaeota and methanogenesis pathways that allow them to reduce redundant energy consumption in methane metabolism, ensuring them to adapt to the wild environments.

"5","wild","Thus, artificial feeding wild animals during the program of ex situ conservation have to be modified on their dietary selection adopted in the wild, despite humans attempt to simulate wild diets for them. "
"6","wild","In other words, there exist a great variety in the richness of the dietary components between the animal groups living in the wild and the captivities. "
"7","wild","Thus, it is critical to monitor digestive system of the animals in the captivities in order to know whether they have adapted to artificial food provisioned and new environment – an important issue in wildlife conservation (Murray et al., 2016). "
"8","wild","It is reported that some wild animal populations raised by the artificial program to avoid declining population size have to change their digestive system following the modification of dietary components that are different from those taken from the wild. "
"9","wild","This kind of artificial food feeding is based on previous experience rather than on the diet of wild populations (Xie, 2011). "
"10","wild","The CG diet, different from those from the wild, has a higher proportion of carbohydrate, but lower level of fibers (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). "
"11","wild","Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) are rapidly disappearing in the wild. "
"12","wild","We are, however, facing the problems of how to maintain appropriate food components that can keep their normal nutrition adopted in the wild, and a healthy digestive system naturally selected through environmental adaptation (Zhu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016). "
"13","wild","Compared to the wild condition, the captive group obviously is provisioned more food and even high energy items, but diversity of provisioned food seems to be less than the nature food. "
"14","wild","In this regard, the microbiota of wild group can provide a good indicator that tells the direction of provision artificial food (Gorvitovskaia et al., 2016; Hale et al., 2017). "
"15","wild","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Fecal Sample Collection Thirty-seven fecal samples were collected totally: fourteen from 14 individuals in Xinglongshan Alpine musk deer farm and 23 from 23 wild individuals in the Mts. "
"16","wild","The estimated population size of wild group is less than 100 individuals (Yang et al., 2003). "
"17","wild","We found that musk deer shared similar main community constituents, both wild and domesticated groups. "
"18","wild","Therefore, the ability to absorb nutrients from high-fiber foods is the key to the survival of wild musk deer, and high F/B ratios in gut microbiota are clearly of great significance. "
"19","wild","The significant enrichment of fiber-degrading bacteria in the wild population corresponds to its higher fiber feeding, indicating that the intestinal microbes play an active role in helping the host to absorb nutrients and adapt to the environment. "
"20","wild","Enrichment of methane metabolic pathways and the increase of methanogens in captive individuals, show that captive individuals are more dependent on methane metabolic pathways, while wild individuals are enriched in acetogens and functional gene deletions in methane production pathways, showing more dependence on acetogens for hydrogen utilization. "
"21","wild","From the wild to the captivity, the changes in the flora function caused by different diet directly lead to an increase in the level of methane metabolism, which affects the efficiency of the energy absorption. "
"22","wild","To improve captivity-based breeding programs more experiments are still required to search for ideal ways of narrowing the gap between wild and captivity group in terms of dietary selection, which would play in important role in musk deer conservation. "
"23","wild","The gut microbiota appears to compensate for seasonal diet variation in the wild black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). "
"24","wild","Gut microbiome composition and metabolomic profiles of wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) reflect host ecology. "
"25","wild","Gut microbiomes of wild great apes fluctuate seasonally in response to diet. "
"26","wild","Comparative analysis of the gut microbiota composition between captive and wild forest musk deer. "
"27","adaptation","Such phenomenon allows the hosts to adapt to environmental changes under the principles and regulations of natural selection and environmental adaptation. "
"28","adaptation","We are, however, facing the problems of how to maintain appropriate food components that can keep their normal nutrition adopted in the wild, and a healthy digestive system naturally selected through environmental adaptation (Zhu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016).
