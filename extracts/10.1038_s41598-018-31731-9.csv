"
"2","wild","We also show that habitat environmental stress could impact these gut microbial communities, suggesting that habitat pollution could indirectly threaten wild animals by altering their gut microbiome. "
"3","wild","The swan goose (Anser cygnoides), a wetland-dependent herbivore waterbird, is a representative species of wild Anseriformes of Anatidae (Fig. "
"4","wild","These wild geese migrate thousands of miles every year between their breeding and wintering areas. "
"5","wild","It should also be noted that these studies have mainly focused on either economically important avians, such as chickens and turkeys, or rare wild species, such as hoatzins13, kakapo14, penguins15, vultures16, Procellariiformes seabirds17 and hooded cranes18. "
"6","wild","As the living areas for most wild animals, wild habitats have huge impacts on the health of all residents, including their behavior, foraging, growth, and breeding22,23. "
"7","wild","This wildlife refuge is located in eastern Mongolia, which has low levels of human activities (Fig. "
"8","wild","Basic information of pMENs. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 6SCIEntIfIC RepoRTs | (2018) 8:13314 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31731-9 Discussion Recent studies have explored the critical roles that animal gut microbiomes play in food digestion, metabolism regulation, and immune protection for wild animals5,6.

"9","wild","Nodes represented OTUs, and lines connecting nodes (edges) represented positive (blue) and negative (red) interactions defined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 7SCIEntIfIC RepoRTs | (2018) 8:13314 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31731-9 drivers of gut microbiome assemblies of wild animals25,27, while other factors could also alter gut microbiome composition, including age30, health31, and the habitat environment22,24,32,33. "
"10","wild","Therefore, these wild birds have a very narrow dietary range, such that the food sources are very similar in these two habitats. "
"11","wild","With the above results, we found that the general composition and central taxa of the wild swan goose gut microbiome were consistent between breeding and wintering areas due to the same bacterial and fungal species. "
"12","wild","The activities and behaviors of wild animals have always been affected by human activities41. "
"13","wild","In summary, the general composition and central taxa of the wild swan goose gut microbiome was generally unaffected by long-distance migration. "
"14","wild","Additionally, many disease-related and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways, pathogenic bacteria, and negative correlation were found in bacteria communities of samples in Poyang Lake, indicating the impact of habitat environment on the gut microbiome of wild animals. "
"15","wild","Our results revealed the variety of wild swan geese during their migration. "
"16","wild","We also indicated that, with the exceptions of food nutrients and host genetic distinctions, the habitat environments could alter the gut microbial communities of wild animals leading to the enrichment of some environmental-specific species in their intestines. "
"17","wild","Thus, polluted habitats may pose serious health threats to wild animals in part through alterations to their gut microbiome. "
"18","wild","Conclusion In summary, the general composition and central taxa of the wild swan goose gut microbiome were relatively unchanged after long-distance host migration. "
"19","wild","Additionally, many disease-related and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways, pathogenic bacteria, and negative correlation were found in bacteria communities of samples in Poyang Lake, indicating the impact of habitat environment on the gut microbiome of wild animals. "
"20","wild","Our results revealed that excepting for food nutrients and host genetic distinctions, the habitat environment could also alter the gut microbial communities of wild animals and enrich some environmental-specific species in their intestines. "
"21","wild","Thus, the polluted habitats are serious health threats to all wild animals in part through their gut microbiomes. "
