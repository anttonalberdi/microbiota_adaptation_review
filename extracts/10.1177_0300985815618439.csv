"1","wild","The studies demonstrate that experimental infection of MNV in wild-type mice results in minimal to no histologic changes. "
"2","wild","Interestingly, however, many strains of mice—including wild-type and other immunodeficient strains, such as recombination activating gene-deficient (Rag-/-) mice, which lack T and B cells—did not succumb to lethal disease after infection with MNV-1. "
"3","wild","These lesions are characterized as mild to severe, multifocal to diffuse inflammatory lesions with variable necrosis or fibrosis.45,49 In contrast, only minimal to mild hepatic lesions have been reported in immunocompetent outbred SW mice and wild-type 129 mice. "
"4","wild","In SW mice, there were small foci of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, or macrophages in 80% of livers, and they were not consistently associated with MNV-positive IHC staining.38 In 129 wild-type mice, 15% of livers had hepatic veins with adhesions of mononuclear leukocytes (diagnosed as mild vasculitis by the authors) with occasional mild inflammatory foci.45 Pneumonia has been reported in naturally infected Stat1-/and IfngR-/-mice but not wild-type mice, indicating the importance of the interferon response in controlling inflammation against viral infections such as MNV.45,49 Interestingly, although noroviruses are gastrointestinal pathogens, only 1 report described histologic changes in the intestines of 129 mice naturally infected with MNV, and these changes were limited to enlargement of Peyer patches with increased germinal centers.45 This suggests that MNV is well adapted to its immunocompetent host and causes no or only subtle disease in the intestines after natural infection. "
"5","wild","Controlled experimental MNV infections in wild-type mice allow for the evaluation of histologic lesions attributable to MNV without other confounding variables, such as immunodeficiency, unknown inoculating dose, viral strain, or timing of infection (Table 2). "
"6","wild","The majority of studies conducted in wild-type mice infected with MNV show no overt clinical signs of disease or histologic lesions. "
"7","wild","However, histologic changes were recently reported in wild-type 129 mice, including mild to moderate lesions in the liver (defined as 1–2 or 5–10 foci of inflammatory cells per 10 fields at 10 objective, respectively) and reactive changes in the lymphoid tissues, including enlargement of small intestinal Peyer patches with increased Table 2.

"
"9","model","To address the potential impact of MNV infection on research outcomes, numerous studies have been conducted with various mouse models of human disease and have generated mixed results, ranging from no impact to significant disease. "
"10","model","The aim of this review is to summarize the histologic findings that have been reported with MNV infection in several mouse models. "
"11","model","In specific disease models including atherosclerosis, MNV infection had a variable impact that was dependent on the mouse model, viral strain, timing of infection, or other experimental variables. "
"12","model","It is important to recognize the reported MNV lesions to help discern the possible influence of MNV infection on data generated in mouse models. "
"13","model","Importantly, MNV has a tropism to infect macrophages and dendritic cells and, more recently, has been reported to infect B cells.18,50 Infection of immune cells therefore raises the possibility that MNV may be a confounding factor in mouse models of inflammatory disease. "
"14","model","Surprisingly, results have been variable in that some mouse models are altered by MNV infection, while others do not show any changes. "
"15","model","For example, MNV has been shown to cause Paneth cell abnormalities in a mouse model of Crohn’s disease and to exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a Helicobacter bilis–driven mouse model of IBD.4,29 Additionally, MNV has been reported to disrupt the epithelial barrier and increase inflammation in the stomach and colon of Il10-deficient mice.3 Effects outside the gastrointestinal system have also been reported with MNV infection, resulting in increased atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor–deficient mice.36 MNV infection also altered another commonly used mouse model of atherosclerosis, the apolipoprotein E (Apoe)– deficient mice, but that effect was variable.12 Interestingly, however, a number of studies have also reported a lack of effect of MNV infection on research mouse models. "
"16","model","MNV infection did not alter IBD in Il10-deficient mice or the development of colon cancer in Smad3-deficient mice when inflammation was driven by H. bilis.13,28 MNV infection did not disrupt the intestinal microbiota in Swiss Webster (SW) or C57BL/6 mice.34 Infection of mice with MNV also had little or no impact on studies of mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus, Friend retrovirus, vaccinia virus, or influenza A virus and did not alter a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.1,5,10,35 Collectively, these studies highlight the variable effect that MNV has on mouse models of disease, suggesting that research using MNV-infected mice should be carefully scrutinized for potential confounding effects. "
"17","model","Histologic Lesions Caused by MNV Infection in Mice As described above, MNV infection may alter some mouse models of disease but may have little or no impact on other models. "
"18","model","This variable response may be due to a number of factors, including the particular disease model being studied or differences in pathogenicity of the infecting MNV strain. "
"19","model","Since noroviruses are gastrointestinal pathogens, much of the research on the impact of MNV has been conducted on mouse models of gastrointestinal disease (Table 4), including dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)–induced colitis, mice with disrupted expression of the autophagy related 16–like 1 gene (Atg16L1), and mice deficient in multidrug resistance gene 1a (FVB.129P2-Abcb1atm1Bor; Mdr1a-/-; Figs. 5–8) or in interleukin-10 (B6.129P2-Il10tm1Cgn/J;Il10-/-). "
"20","model","DSS is administered orally to mice to cause direct damage to the intestinal epithelium as a model of IBD, while mutations in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 have been associated with Crohn’s disease.4,7,43 Mdr1a-/mice have an altered intestinal epithelial barrier, while Il10-/mice have impaired regulatory T cells resulting in IBD.7,43 MNV infections in different mouse models of gastrointestinal disease varied in their ability to cause intestinal histologic lesions, perhaps due to the particular MNV strain used for infection, timing of MNV infection, or whether another experimental infectious agent was present. "
"21","model","Overall, the impact of MNV infection in mouse models of gastrointestinal disease varies widely, from having little to no impact to causing significantly increased inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. "
"22","model","These data underscore the importance of continuing to investigate the impact that MNV infection may have on various mouse models of disease. "
"23","model","Figures 5–8 are reprinted from ‘‘Murine norovirus: an intercurrent variable in a mouse model of bacteria-induced inflammatory bowel disease,’’ Lencioni KC, et al. "
"24","model","Therefore, determining the impact that MNV infection may have on various mouse models of disease is important to ensure that research results are valid. "
"25","model","While it is impractical to test whether MNV infection alters all mouse models of disease, more and more studies are being performed to answer the following question: ‘‘Will MNV infection alter and confound my research results?’’ "
"26","model","Importantly, MNV has a variable impact on mouse models, in some cases increasing lesions while in other cases having no impact. "
"27","model","Consequently, it is important to recognize reported MNV lesions to help discern the possible influence of MNV infection on data generated in mouse models. "

"
"36","knockout","Our laboratory has evaluated the impact of MNV infection on atherosclerosis in B6.129P2Apoetm1Unc/J (Apoe-/-; Figs. 9, 10) and in low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)–deficient mice (B6.129S7-Ldlrtm1her/J), and we include previously unpublished data from our laboratory on the lack of impact that MNV infection had on the development of atherosclerosis in Apoe/Tlr3 double-knockout mice.36,37 Interestingly, although a major component of atherosclerotic plaques is lipid-laden macrophages and even though MNV has as tropism for infecting macrophages, we found a variable influence of MNV infection on the development of atherosclerosis.
