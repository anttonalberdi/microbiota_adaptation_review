"1","wild","The studies demonstrate that experimental infection of MNV in wild-type mice results in minimal to no histologic changes. "
"2","wild","Interestingly, however, many strains of mice—including wild-type and other immunodeficient strains, such as recombination activating gene-deficient (Rag-/-) mice, which lack T and B cells—did not succumb to lethal disease after infection with MNV-1. "
"3","wild","These lesions are characterized as mild to severe, multifocal to diffuse inflammatory lesions with variable necrosis or fibrosis.45,49 In contrast, only minimal to mild hepatic lesions have been reported in immunocompetent outbred SW mice and wild-type 129 mice. "
"4","wild","In SW mice, there were small foci of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, or macrophages in 80% of livers, and they were not consistently associated with MNV-positive IHC staining.38 In 129 wild-type mice, 15% of livers had hepatic veins with adhesions of mononuclear leukocytes (diagnosed as mild vasculitis by the authors) with occasional mild inflammatory foci.45 Pneumonia has been reported in naturally infected Stat1-/and IfngR-/-mice but not wild-type mice, indicating the importance of the interferon response in controlling inflammation against viral infections such as MNV.45,49 Interestingly, although noroviruses are gastrointestinal pathogens, only 1 report described histologic changes in the intestines of 129 mice naturally infected with MNV, and these changes were limited to enlargement of Peyer patches with increased germinal centers.45 This suggests that MNV is well adapted to its immunocompetent host and causes no or only subtle disease in the intestines after natural infection. "
"5","wild","Controlled experimental MNV infections in wild-type mice allow for the evaluation of histologic lesions attributable to MNV without other confounding variables, such as immunodeficiency, unknown inoculating dose, viral strain, or timing of infection (Table 2). "
"6","wild","The majority of studies conducted in wild-type mice infected with MNV show no overt clinical signs of disease or histologic lesions. "
"7","wild","However, histologic changes were recently reported in wild-type 129 mice, including mild to moderate lesions in the liver (defined as 1–2 or 5–10 foci of inflammatory cells per 10 fields at 10 objective, respectively) and reactive changes in the lymphoid tissues, including enlargement of small intestinal Peyer patches with increased Table 2.
