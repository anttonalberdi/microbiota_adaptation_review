"29","wild","Furthermore, whereasHFD had little effect on glucose tolerance in wild-type FVB mice, which are known to be resistant to diet-induced obesity/glucose intolerance (23, 24), it caused a significant deterioration of glucose tolerance in FIAF-Tg mice (Fig. "
"30","wild","Also, plasma HDL levels were significantly more elevated by HFD in FIAF-Tg mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. "
