"1","wild","By applying a number of in vitro bioassays and comparing wild type, knockout mutant and complemented strains, we have now demonstrated that SslE specifically contributes to degradation of mucin substrates, typically present in the intestine and bladder. "
"2","wild","To exclude the possibility that the SslE signal at the bacterial surface could be partially attributed to the re-association of the secreted form of the protein to the membrane, we co-cultured the IHE3034 wild-type (WT) strain with the IHE3034DsslE strain engineered to express the GFP fluorescent protein. "

"12","fitness","Although these data do not exclude that the catabolism of such glycoproteins may also contribute to an increased fitness of E. coli in the outer mucus layer, the pathogenic strains that are armed with immune evasion virulence factors may use SslE as a spearhead to penetrate the sterile inner mucus layer so as to intimately adhere to the epithelial cells of the host.

"
"22","mutant","In our study, the diminished capacity of the sslE mutant strain to translocate through a mucin-rich matrix in vitro suggests that SslE activity may facilitate bacterial penetration of the mucosal surface, including the inner mucus layer, to reach the underlying host epithelium. "

"26","mutant","By comparing the SslE-specific signal between IHE3034 WT and the IHE3034Dkps deletion mutant by FACS and confocal imaging analysis, we demonstrated that the K1 capsule clearly interferes with the anti-SslE antibody accessibility and recognition of the protein on the bacterial surface.
