"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","By applying a number of in vitro bioassays and comparing wild type, knockout mutant and complemented strains, we have now demonstrated that SslE specifically contributes to degradation of mucin substrates, typically present in the intestine and bladder. "
"2","wild","To exclude the possibility that the SslE signal at the bacterial surface could be partially attributed to the re-association of the secreted form of the protein to the membrane, we co-cultured the IHE3034 wild-type (WT) strain with the IHE3034DsslE strain engineered to express the GFP fluorescent protein. "
"3","wild","Confocal images of (A) IHE3034 wild-type, (B) IHE3034DsslE knockout mutant and (C) IHE3034DsslE::sslE_WT complemented strain. "
"4","wild","Incubation of mucin-based plates with the complemented strain IHE3034DsslE::sslE_WT carrying the WT sslE gene fully restored the wild-type phenotype as assessed by the lack of amido black staining. "
"5","wild","IHE3034 wild-type, IHE3034DsslE knockout mutant, IHE3034DsslE::sslE_WT (complemented with the sslE wild-type gene), and IHE3034DsslE::sslE_mut (complemented with the sslE gene mutated in the putative metallopeptidase motif), were grown on plates containing 0.5% bovine submaxillary mucin (SIGMA) and stained with 0.1% (wt/vol) amido black in 3.5 M acetic acid for 30 min and destained with 1.2 M acetic acid. "
"6","wild","(A) IHE3034 wild-type, the IHE3034DsslE knockout mutant, IHE3034DsslE::sslE_WT (complemented with the sslE gene wild-type) and IHE3034DsslE::sslE_mut (complemented with sslE gene mutated in the putative metallopeptidase motif), were loaded on the top of a mucin-gel matrix column polymerized in a 1 ml syringe. "
"7","wild","Complemented strains were obtained by transformation of the sslE mutant with sslE_WT and sslE_mut recombinant plasmids, carrying the sslE wild-type gene or the gene mutated in the putative metallopeptidase motif. "
"8","wild","IHE3034 wildtype, IHE3034DsslE knockout mutant, IHE3034DsslE::sslE_WT and IHE3034DsslE::sslE_mut were transformed by electroporation with the pGEN-luxCDABE plasmid (AmpR) expressing luciferase (plux strains). "
"9","wild","(A) Flow cytometry detection of K1 capsule on wild-type strain IHE3034 (left panel) and acapsulated IHE3034Dkps strains (right panel) by anti-capsule monoclonal antibody SEAM12 (blue lanes). "
"10","wild","(B) SslE surface detection on wild-type IHE3034 (left panel) and its derivative lacking the capsule IHE3034Dkps (right panel) by anti-SslE immune sera (blue lines) compared to the PBS negative control (red). "
"11","wild","(B) Inhibition of wild-type IHE3034 translocation through a mucin-gel matrix by anti-C-SslE antibodies compared to negative controls. "
"12","fitness","Although these data do not exclude that the catabolism of such glycoproteins may also contribute to an increased fitness of E. coli in the outer mucus layer, the pathogenic strains that are armed with immune evasion virulence factors may use SslE as a spearhead to penetrate the sterile inner mucus layer so as to intimately adhere to the epithelial cells of the host.
