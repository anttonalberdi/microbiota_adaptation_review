"4","model","Changes in EC cell numbers and 5-HT have been observed in a number of GI diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as well as in animal models of various enteric infections, including with the helminth parasite, Trichuris muris (8–14). "
"5","model","Finally, using the enteric parasite T. muris model, we unveil an important role of TLR2 in mediating changes in colonic 5-HT levels. "
"6","model","Direct activation of TLR2 signaling by Pam3CKS4 in EC cells upregulates Tph1 and 5-HT levels via NF-kB pathway To test the direct effect of TLR signaling in regulating 5-HT production in the gut, we used BON cells, which are a wellestablished model of human EC cells expressing functional TLR1, 2, and 4 (26). "
"7","model","TLR2 plays an important role in stimulating 5-HT production during T. muris infection To investigate the role of TLRs in mediating 5-HT release in an enteric infection model, we used the nematode parasite T. muris that resides in the large intestine of mice. "

"
"12","model","Using T. muris model, we have previously observed higher 5-HT levels and EC cell numbers in C57BL/6 mice, which are resistant to infection by expelling worms through a Th2-type immune response, as compared with susceptible AKR mice that developed chronic infection with the generation of a Th1 response (11).
