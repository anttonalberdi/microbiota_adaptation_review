"2","wild","Recently, we reported the reduced severity of colitis and downregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines in Tph1deficient (Tph12/2) mice, which have significantly reduced 5-HT in the gut compared with wild-type (WT) mice after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)– and 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid–induced colitis (15).
