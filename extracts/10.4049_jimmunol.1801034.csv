"1","wild","Tlr22/2 mice and anti-TLR2 Ab–treated mice infected with enteric parasite, Trichuris muris, exhibited attenuated 5-HT production, compared with infected wild-type mice. "
"2","wild","Recently, we reported the reduced severity of colitis and downregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines in Tph1deficient (Tph12/2) mice, which have significantly reduced 5-HT in the gut compared with wild-type (WT) mice after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)– and 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid–induced colitis (15). "
"3","wild","Abbreviations used in this article: BMC, bone marrow cell; DSS, dextran sulfate sodium; EC, enterochromaffin; EEC, enteroendocrine cell; ESP, excretory-secretory product; FSC, forward scatter; GF, germ-free; GI, gastrointestinal; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; SPF, specific pathogen–free; SSC, side scatter; Tph1, tryptophan hydroxylase 1; v3, variable 3; WT, wild-type. "
"4","model","Changes in EC cell numbers and 5-HT have been observed in a number of GI diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as well as in animal models of various enteric infections, including with the helminth parasite, Trichuris muris (8–14). "
"5","model","Finally, using the enteric parasite T. muris model, we unveil an important role of TLR2 in mediating changes in colonic 5-HT levels. "
"6","model","Direct activation of TLR2 signaling by Pam3CKS4 in EC cells upregulates Tph1 and 5-HT levels via NF-kB pathway To test the direct effect of TLR signaling in regulating 5-HT production in the gut, we used BON cells, which are a wellestablished model of human EC cells expressing functional TLR1, 2, and 4 (26). "
"7","model","TLR2 plays an important role in stimulating 5-HT production during T. muris infection To investigate the role of TLRs in mediating 5-HT release in an enteric infection model, we used the nematode parasite T. muris that resides in the large intestine of mice. "
"8","model","This parasite is very similar to the human parasite Trichuris trichiura and is a commonly used model for studying host immunity in enteric nematode parasite infections. "
"9","model","In animal models, increased 5-HT levels have been observed in colitis induced by 2,4,6trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, and DSS (5, 51, 52). "
"10","model","Our present data from T. muris infection model provide evidence that TLR2 stands out as a key player in regulating EC cell biology during infection. "
"11","model","It is worth mentioning here that i.p. injection of the Ab significantly downregulated mucosal TLR2 expression along with attenuating inflammation in the DSS-colitis model (59), further supporting the view that anti-TLR2 Ab treatment via the i.p. route may have therapeutic potential to efficiently target TLR2 during infectious and inflammatory diseases. "
"12","model","Using T. muris model, we have previously observed higher 5-HT levels and EC cell numbers in C57BL/6 mice, which are resistant to infection by expelling worms through a Th2-type immune response, as compared with susceptible AKR mice that developed chronic infection with the generation of a Th1 response (11). "
"13","model","Enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia and decreased serotonin transporter in a mouse model of postinfectious bowel dysfunction. "
"14","model","Trichuris muris: a model of gastrointestinal parasite infection. "
