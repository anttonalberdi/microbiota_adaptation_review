"2","wild","In addition, in vivo infection experiments using mice lacking selected antibody isotypes or key complement factors did not proceed significantly different from experiments using wild-type mice, supporting the notion that the mouse-specific schistomicidal serum activity must be derived from distinct therapeutic candidate compounds other than antibodies and three of the most abundant complement proteins in the serum including the central factor C3."
"3","wild","Furthermore, NTS were cultured and maintained in hybridoma medium supplemented with 200 U/ml Penicillin and 200 mg/ml Streptomycin (100 NTS in 150 µl) with 20% mouse serum derived from C1q-/-, sIgM-/-, C3-/-, C4-/-, Rag1-/or wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and viability was scored at the indicated time points. "
"4","wild","Infection of sIgM-/or C1q-/Mice and Assessment of Parasite Maturation and Fecundity To assess the maturation and fecundity of parasites, wild-type (WT), sIgM-/or C1q-/mice were infected by injecting subcutaneously 200 viable cercariae. "
"5","wild","We observed that sIgM-/and Rag1-/sera already significantly affected NTS viability at day three and killed NTS in the same manner by day seven (sIgM-/(0.25 ± 0), Rag1-/-(0 ± 0)) compared to wild-type (WT) (0 ± 0) serum, ruling out the possibility of lethal effects by natural IgM (Figure 4A) and immunoglobulins in general (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 1).

"
"17","disease","Annual loss of disease-adjusted life years (DALYs) is estimated at 2.54 million, the second most devastating parasitic disease after malaria (7), and recently the overall disease burden has increased further (8). "
"18","environment","Thriving in this hostile environment is a remarkable feature, as besides cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, the blood contains a vast array of highly effective defensive humoral serum factors, including complement factors and polyreactive natural antibodies that are mostly of the IgM isotype. "
"19","environment","A value of P < 0.05 was considered as significant.RESULTS Murine Serum Rapidly Kills Whereas Human Serum Supports Larval Development After entering their definite host, schistosomes migrate and develop in a hostile and immune defense-rich environment,Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4including the skin, blood, lungs and lymphatic system, which all contain soluble serum factors to different extents. "
"20","human","Results: In contrast to sera from humans and a broad variety of mammalian species, serum from mice, surprisingly, killed parasites already at skin stage in vitro. "
"21","human","Infection of the human host starts when S. mansoni cercariae, the free-living larvae that are released into fresh water by infected snails infect humans by penetrating intact skin and transforming into the succeeding developmental stage, the schistosomulae. "
"22","human","We report here that, in contrast to human serum, which in fact promotes and supports NTS survival and development in vitro, mouse serum rapidly killed NTS, revealing the presence of strongly schistomicidal serum compound(s) in murine blood. "
"23","human","Origin and Preparation of Human and Non-human Primate Serum Sera were prepared from fresh blood collected from S. mansoninaïve non-human primates (NHP, rhesus macaques) (license number AZ 33.9-42502-04-12/0704, Deutsches Primatenzentrum, Göttingen, Germany) and from consenting healthy volunteers with no previous history of schistosomiasis as approved by the TUM ethical committee (license number AZ 215/18 S).

"24","human","NTS Assays With Sera From Different Hosts To compare the effects of the serum-specific factors of human and mouse, the main definitive and laboratory host, respectively, we cultured NTS (100 NTS in 150 µl) in a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plate (Cat. "
"25","human","Additionally, NTS were cultured following the same procedure in the presence or absence of 20% human or mouse sera and scored initially at day zero, one and three and then weekly up to four weeks. "
"26","human","Finally, NTS were cultured in media supplemented simultaneously with both human and mouse sera at different concentrations (10-20%). "
"27","human","We observed that HM supplemented with 20% of human serum (HSe) supported the larval development and survival in vitro up to the juvenile worms (lLiS), the prepairing stage of S. mansoni (Figures 1A–C) from skin-stage schistosomulae (SkS) via lung stage (LuS) and early liver stage (eLiS). "
"28","human","Host Serum Dictates Larval Survival and Development Since mouse and human sera influenced the survival and development of NTS in such a contrasting manner, we sought to unveil whether those effects were exclusive to humans and mice or if sera from other mammalian species also exert similar effects. "
"29","human","To evaluate long-term survival and development of NTS, we cultured NTS in HM in presence or absence of serum from schistosome-naïve rhesus macaques as a non-human primate (NHPSe), horses (HoSe), swine (SwSe), bovines (FCS), sheep (ShSe), rabbits (RbSe), hamsters (HmSe) or rats (RtSe) at the same concentration (20%) as before. "
"30","human","In contrast, viability of NTS cultured in HM supplemented with serum from NHP, evolutionarily most related to human but not a natural host of S. mansoni, started to decline quickly within the first three days and very few NTS survived until week four (Figure 2B) and again their development stagnated in the lung stage similarly toApril 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 635622 Anisuzzaman et al. "
"31","human","Third, “natural” IgM, with comparatively high avidity to conserved microbial compounds, is present even in naïve sera and has the potential to target NTS upon first contact with blood.A C B FIGURE 1 | Mouse serum rapidly kills NTS whereas human serum promotes their development and survival. "
"32","human","NTS were cultured in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of human serum (HSe) or MSe and the viability scored at day seven. "
"33","human","To do so, we incubated NTS in HM supplemented with 10-20% of mouse and 10-20% of human sera. "
"34","human","Importantly, the results indicate that murine schistosomicidal activity is retained in the presence of HSe, opening the door to further characterization and isolation of the compound(s) for potential therapeutic use in humans.DISCUSSION Despite decades-long MDA with anthelminthics, mostly praziquantel, the size of the schistosome infected population has not decreased substantially but has rather increased, resulting in severe socioeconomic problems in the endemic countries (1, 8, 31). "
"35","human","It allows the establishment of patency and mimics most of the immunopathologies observed in humans. "
"36","human","In sharp contrast, hybridoma medium supplemented with human serum not only supported the prolonged survival of NTS but also promoted in vitro development of NTS up to juvenile worms, the pre-pairing adult stage. "
"37","human","Another interesting finding within this study was the dramatic, detrimental effect on early NTS survival caused by serum from rhesus macaques, the closest relative to humans that we tested so far. "
"38","human","However, there still seems to be quite dramatic differences between different nonhuman primates; the rhesus macaque, for example, seems to be a rather poor host compared to the baboon (43). "
"39","human","The only important naturally occurring final host for S. mansoni is the human (48, 49). "
"40","human","This might explain why S. mansoni NTS not only survived but also developed to juvenile stage in vitro solely upon addition of serum from humans and not upon addition of sera from other tested species that supported long term survivalFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10and development. "
"41","human","Importantly, the schistosomicidal activity of the killing component(s) in mouse serum is preserved in the presence of human serum at both lower and higher concentration, revealing a notable feature for any therapeutic potential. "
