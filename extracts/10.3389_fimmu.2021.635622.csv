"1","wild","Rather, the reduction of parasite maturation from cercariae to adult worms was comparable to wild-type mice.org April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 6356221 Anisuzzaman et al. "
"2","wild","In addition, in vivo infection experiments using mice lacking selected antibody isotypes or key complement factors did not proceed significantly different from experiments using wild-type mice, supporting the notion that the mouse-specific schistomicidal serum activity must be derived from distinct therapeutic candidate compounds other than antibodies and three of the most abundant complement proteins in the serum including the central factor C3."
"3","wild","Furthermore, NTS were cultured and maintained in hybridoma medium supplemented with 200 U/ml Penicillin and 200 mg/ml Streptomycin (100 NTS in 150 µl) with 20% mouse serum derived from C1q-/-, sIgM-/-, C3-/-, C4-/-, Rag1-/or wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and viability was scored at the indicated time points. "
"4","wild","Infection of sIgM-/or C1q-/Mice and Assessment of Parasite Maturation and Fecundity To assess the maturation and fecundity of parasites, wild-type (WT), sIgM-/or C1q-/mice were infected by injecting subcutaneously 200 viable cercariae. "
"5","wild","We observed that sIgM-/and Rag1-/sera already significantly affected NTS viability at day three and killed NTS in the same manner by day seven (sIgM-/(0.25 ± 0), Rag1-/-(0 ± 0)) compared to wild-type (WT) (0 ± 0) serum, ruling out the possibility of lethal effects by natural IgM (Figure 4A) and immunoglobulins in general (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 1). "
"6","wild","NTS were cultured and maintained using hybridoma medium (HM) supplemented with 20% sIgM-/-, Rag1-/-, or wild-type mouse (WT) sera at 37°C in 5% CO2 for four weeks. "
"7","wild","Liver sections (4 µm) from infected wild-type or sIgM-/mice were stained with Masson’s Blue and the diameter of 30-40 granulomas/section was measured microscopically (10x). "
"8","wild","NTS were cultured and maintained using sera collected from (A) C1q-/-, (B) C3-/-, (C) C4-/or wild-type (WT) mice and viability scoring was performed at the indicated time points. "
"9","wild","Liver sections (4 µm) from infected wild-type or C1q-/mice were stained with Masson’s Blue and the diameter of 30-40 granuloma/section was measured under microscope (10x). "
"10","wild","Lymphocytes (2x105) from wild-type or C1q-/mice infected for 11 weeks with S. mansoni were re-stimulated in vitro with or without (Ctrl) SEA (20 µg/ ml) or anti-CD3/28 (1µg/ml) for 48 h. "
