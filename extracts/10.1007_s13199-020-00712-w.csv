"1","wild","Because it is timeconsuming to isolate stress tolerant symbionts from the wild even when appropriate types exist, mutation and selection of symbionts is a promising alternative approach. "
"2","fitness","In contrast, some previous studies detected either positive or no effect of long-term selection on microorganisms’ fitness under stress. "
"3","fitness","Thermal adaptation was also observed in free-living algal coral symbionts, as their fitness was higher at elevated temperature after 80 generations of selection (Chakravarti et al. "
"4","fitness","In addition, negative carry over effects might occur, in which long term exposure to stress in ancestors decreases offspring fitness (Ross et al. "
"5","fitness","Our results indicate detrimental mutations could occur through symbiont mutagenesis and reduce host fitness. "
"6","fitness","(Giauque et al. 2019) found naturally occurring stress tolerant endophytic fungi improved plant fitness under stress; and Chakravarti et al. "
"7","fitness","In our case, hosting a stress tolerant symbiont population was likely to increase the holobiont fitness under stress. "
"8","fitness","In addition, altering the fitness of the holobionts via symbionts may come at the cost of their fitness in other situations. "
"9","fitness","Future research should investigate the mechanisms by which symbionts affect holobiont stress tolerance in order to identify symbionts with traits that are likely to improve their fitness under stress, and evaluate their effect in the host comprehensively. "

"11","adaptation","This could allow rapid “adaptation” of slow-growing symbiont-bearing species via changes in symbionts, which otherwise may not be able to survive environmental changes solely through evolution of the host (Császár et al. "
"12","adaptation","Thermal adaptation was also observed in free-living algal coral symbionts, as their fitness was higher at elevated temperature after 80 generations of selection (Chakravarti et al. "
"13","adaptation","Physiological and molecular adaptations of zooxanthellae and their hosts to symbiosis. "
