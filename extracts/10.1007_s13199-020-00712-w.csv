"1","wild","Because it is timeconsuming to isolate stress tolerant symbionts from the wild even when appropriate types exist, mutation and selection of symbionts is a promising alternative approach. "
"2","fitness","In contrast, some previous studies detected either positive or no effect of long-term selection on microorganisms’ fitness under stress. "
"3","fitness","Thermal adaptation was also observed in free-living algal coral symbionts, as their fitness was higher at elevated temperature after 80 generations of selection (Chakravarti et al. "
"4","fitness","In addition, negative carry over effects might occur, in which long term exposure to stress in ancestors decreases offspring fitness (Ross et al. "
"5","fitness","Our results indicate detrimental mutations could occur through symbiont mutagenesis and reduce host fitness. "
"6","fitness","(Giauque et al. 2019) found naturally occurring stress tolerant endophytic fungi improved plant fitness under stress; and Chakravarti et al. "
"7","fitness","In our case, hosting a stress tolerant symbiont population was likely to increase the holobiont fitness under stress. "
"8","fitness","In addition, altering the fitness of the holobionts via symbionts may come at the cost of their fitness in other situations. "
"9","fitness","Future research should investigate the mechanisms by which symbionts affect holobiont stress tolerance in order to identify symbionts with traits that are likely to improve their fitness under stress, and evaluate their effect in the host comprehensively. "

"11","adaptat","This could allow rapid “adaptation” of slow-growing symbiont-bearing species via changes in symbionts, which otherwise may not be able to survive environmental changes solely through evolution of the host (Császár et al. "

"18","model","To explore whether we could alter holobionts’ stress tolerance by symbiont mutagenesis and selection, we used green hydra (Hydra viridissima) and endosymbiotic algae (Chlorella variabilis NC64A) as our model system (Hamada et al. "
"19","model","We used survival analysis (proc phreg, Cox proportional hazard model) to test how hydra mortality under UV-B depended on algal culture and selection. "
"20","model","To test how algal survival under UV-B test conditions was related to hydra survival under UV-B test conditions when associated with those algae, we performed a correlation (proc corr) between the estimates of change in OD of algal populations under UV-B test conditions as the predictor and the Cox proportional hazardmodel estimates for hydra as the response.

"23","environment","Stress tolerance of holobionts, which is critical for endosymbiosis stability, is a concern in changing environments (e.g., climate change) because malfunction in either the host or the symbiont may lead to endosymbiosis breakdown (Toby Kiers et al. "
"24","environment","This could allow rapid “adaptation” of slow-growing symbiont-bearing species via changes in symbionts, which otherwise may not be able to survive environmental changes solely through evolution of the host (Császár et al. "
"25","environment","However, these novel associations could be unstable due to high specificity of associations or symbiont-bearing species may not be able to acquire suitable symbionts due to a low abundance or diversity of tolerant symbionts in the local environment (Coffroth et al. "
"26","environment","Hydra viridissima 4 Discussion The hologenome theory proposes that rapid genetic changes in symbionts’ genes may allow holobionts to adapt to new environments quickly, which implies artificial modification of symbionts’ genes could be employed to develop holobionts with increased stress tolerance (Zilber-Rosenberg and Rosenberg 2008).
