"2","wild","Such studies may not be applicable to wild populations since artificially selected lineages may have altered social phenotypes (Chalfin et al., 2014; Künzl et al., 2003; Künzl and Sachser, 1999), and behavioral and endocrine responses have evolved in contexts characterized by multiple stressors. "
"3","wild","Here, we use long-term data on a wild population to study the association between the social environment and FGM levels of facultatively social females, and the impact of their FGM levels on offspring fitness. "
"4","wild","Smith et al.

"
"18","fitness","Since changes in maternal baseline glucocorticoids may have positive or negative consequences for offspring fitness, we were also interested in estimating their relationship with measures of reproductive success. "
"19","fitness","Potential benefits of social bonds may be context-specific, and agonistic interactions may be tightly correlated with fitness. "
"20","fitness","Female marmots exhibiting high FGM levels had overall low reproductive success, which is predicted by the cort-fitness hypothesis. "
"21","fitness","In this respect, the strength and stability of female social bonds may be key predictors of fitness (Palanza and Parmigiani, 2017; Stroud et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2000). "
"22","fitness","Assuming that GC levels vary according to the magnitude of environmental challenges, and that individuals facing greater challenges have lower fitness, the cort-fitness hypothesis predicts that baseline GC levels will be negatively associated with long-term survival and/or reproductive success (Bonier et al., 2009a, 2010). "
"23","fitness","Due to conflicting results in different taxa (Bonier et al., 2009b; Dipietro et al., 2006; Maguire and Mody, 2016; Sapolsky et al., 2000; Whirledge and Cidlowski, 2010), the efficiency of GC as a proxy of fitness should be validated in each species (Bonier et al., 2010). "
"24","fitness","Here, we use long-term data on a wild population to study the association between the social environment and FGM levels of facultatively social females, and the impact of their FGM levels on offspring fitness. "
"25","fitness","Maternal FGM levels were associated with position in agonistic networks; mothers both initiating and receiving agonistic interactions had increased FGM levels, so agonistic behavior clearly has an important role in female fitness and marmot social organization. "
"26","fitness","The potential positive fitness effects of social buffering could balance out these negative effects and be a factor that explains affiliative social interactions in yellow-bellied marmots. "
"27","fitness","In more social species, positive outcomes of social bonds on female fitness are more pronounced (Cameron et al., 2009; Silk et al., 2003, 2009, 2010; Vander Wal et al., 2015). "
"28","fitness","Hormones and Behavior 116 (2019) 104577 8 overwinter survival (Wey et al., 2015), which reinforces that FGMs are reliable proxies for female fitness in free-living yellow-bellied marmots and supports the cort-fitness hypothesis (Bonier et al., 2009a, 2010). "
"29","fitness","A negative association between glucocorticoid baseline levels and fitness has been found in other species, such as mice (Maguire and Mody, 2016), barn swallows (Hirundo rustica; Jenni-Eiermann et al., 2008), and tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata; Williams et al., 2008). "
"30","fitness","However, associations between fitness and baseline glucocorticoids give conflicting results depending on the species, individual life history stage and sex (Bonier et al., 2009a, b). "
"31","fitness","This suggested hypothesis follows the rationale of the experience constraint hypothesis (Curio, 1983; Forslund and Part, 1995), where female marmots could learn from experience how to use physiological or environmental cues to increase pup fitness. "
"32","fitness","Previous work has shown that the interaction between maternal age and FGM also determines offspring personality (Petelle et al., 2017), and, if changes on offspring phenotype enhance their fitness, marmot maternal behavior may support the Predictive Adaptive Response (PAR) hypothesis. "
"33","fitness","Females with high FGM levels had offspring with lower annual survival and therefore have an overall lower reproductive success, which supports the cort-fitness hypothesis. "

"39","model","We fitted generalized linear mixed effects models to a dataset including maternal FGM measurements, social network metrics, maternal/ alloparental care, and pup FGM and survival. "
"40","model","To test how maternal fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) levels are associated with the social context and pup care, FGM and survival, we fitted (generalized) linear mixed effects models. "
"41","model","The variables included in the models are explained below. "
"42","model","FGM concentration data were used differently depending on the model fitted. "
"43","model","Statistical analysis According to the distribution of the dependent variable, we fitted linear mixed effects models (LMMs) or generalized linear mixed effects models with binomial distribution (binomial GLMMs). "
"44","model","We used a topdown approach for model selection following Zuur et al. "
"45","model","Initial models contained random effects (individual identity and year), fixed effects and interactions (Table S1), which were selected based on data availability and biological relevance. "
"46","model","The optimal fixed component was found by dropping variables one-by-one and, in each turn, performing likelihood ratio tests (LMM) or analysis of deviance tests (binomial GLMM) to compare nested models. "
"47","model","We computed the marginal and conditional R squared values for all final models to understand how much of the data variance is being explained by fixed and random effects. "
"48","model","Specific data transformations in each model can be found in the Supplementary File S2. "
"49","model","We evaluated the assumptions of the models by visually inspecting the correlation among variables, qq plots of residuals, plots of residuals with fitted values, and plots of residuals with each explanatory variable (present or not in the final model). "
"50","model","We also calculated Cook's distance to look for influential observations and checked model fit by plotting fitted with observed values of the dependent variable. "
"51","model","The fixed effects of the initial models (i.e., first step of the model selection) were group size, litter size, metrics from social networks, predator index, maternal age and time/day of capture in which the fecal sample was collected. "
"52","model","For the models using alarm calling and female-pup interactions, fixed effects were maternal FGM after emergence, litter size, maternal age, predator index and total time spent observing each social group. "

"54","model","The models included maternal FGM after emergence, litter size, maternal age, and predator index as fixed effects. "
"55","model","In one model we used maternal FGM before emergence and, in the other, maternal FGM after emergence mean as fixed effects. "
"56","model","Common fixed effects for both models were litter size, predator index, maternal age, and time/date of capture in which the fecal sample was collected. "
"57","model","Our final model included PC3AFF (group cohesiveness), litter size, predator index, time/date of individual capture, and the interaction between PC3AFF and predator index (Table 2). "
"58","model","Female identity and year (random effects) explained much of the variation in maternal FGM, because this model had a marginal R2 of 0.10 and a conditional R2 of 0.66. "
"59","model","By comparing estimates in this model, we infer that the interaction between group cohesiveness and predator index was the fixed effect with the strongest effect on maternal FGM, followed by litter size (Table 2). "
"60","model","Our final model included PC1AGO (aggression initiated), PC2AGO (aggression received), litter size, and time/day of individual capture (Table 2). "
"61","model","Female identity and year explained a significant portion of the variation in maternal FGM levels; this model had a marginal R2 of 0.13 and a conditional R2 of 0.74. "
"62","model","Our final model was no different from the null model, and annual effects explained more of the variation than maternal identity (Table 3). "
"63","model","In our final model, maternal FGM after emergence and predator index were negatively associated with the occurrence of female-pup interactions (p=0.032 and 0.001, respectively; Table 3). "

"69","model","This model had a marginal R2 of 0.20 and a conditional R2 of 0.20. "
"70","model","Pup FGM levels The model using the average maternal FGM before emergence included 227 FGM measurements from 148 pups of 43 mothers across 7 years, while the model using maternal FGM after emergence included 217 FGM measurements from 139 pups of 40 mothers across 7 years. "
"71","model","The model using maternal FGM before emergence had a marginal R2 of 0.05 and a conditional R2 of 0.65. "
"72","model","In the final models, maternal FGM after emergence was negatively associated with measurements of winter and annual survival (p < 0.001 and= 0.001, respectively; Table 5, Fig. "
"73","model","For the model fitted to summer survival data, we found a negative effect of predator index (p=0.031), where pups were more likely to survive in environments with low predator pressure, and a significant effect of the interaction between maternal FGM after emergence and litter size (p=0.011, Table 5).
