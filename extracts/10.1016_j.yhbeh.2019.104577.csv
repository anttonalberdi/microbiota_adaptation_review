"2","wild","Such studies may not be applicable to wild populations since artificially selected lineages may have altered social phenotypes (Chalfin et al., 2014; Künzl et al., 2003; Künzl and Sachser, 1999), and behavioral and endocrine responses have evolved in contexts characterized by multiple stressors. "
"3","wild","Here, we use long-term data on a wild population to study the association between the social environment and FGM levels of facultatively social females, and the impact of their FGM levels on offspring fitness. "
"4","wild","Smith et al.

"
"18","fitness","Since changes in maternal baseline glucocorticoids may have positive or negative consequences for offspring fitness, we were also interested in estimating their relationship with measures of reproductive success. "
"19","fitness","Potential benefits of social bonds may be context-specific, and agonistic interactions may be tightly correlated with fitness. "
"20","fitness","Female marmots exhibiting high FGM levels had overall low reproductive success, which is predicted by the cort-fitness hypothesis. "
"21","fitness","In this respect, the strength and stability of female social bonds may be key predictors of fitness (Palanza and Parmigiani, 2017; Stroud et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2000). "
"22","fitness","Assuming that GC levels vary according to the magnitude of environmental challenges, and that individuals facing greater challenges have lower fitness, the cort-fitness hypothesis predicts that baseline GC levels will be negatively associated with long-term survival and/or reproductive success (Bonier et al., 2009a, 2010). "
"23","fitness","Due to conflicting results in different taxa (Bonier et al., 2009b; Dipietro et al., 2006; Maguire and Mody, 2016; Sapolsky et al., 2000; Whirledge and Cidlowski, 2010), the efficiency of GC as a proxy of fitness should be validated in each species (Bonier et al., 2010). "
"24","fitness","Here, we use long-term data on a wild population to study the association between the social environment and FGM levels of facultatively social females, and the impact of their FGM levels on offspring fitness. "
"25","fitness","Maternal FGM levels were associated with position in agonistic networks; mothers both initiating and receiving agonistic interactions had increased FGM levels, so agonistic behavior clearly has an important role in female fitness and marmot social organization. "
"26","fitness","The potential positive fitness effects of social buffering could balance out these negative effects and be a factor that explains affiliative social interactions in yellow-bellied marmots. "
"27","fitness","In more social species, positive outcomes of social bonds on female fitness are more pronounced (Cameron et al., 2009; Silk et al., 2003, 2009, 2010; Vander Wal et al., 2015). "
"28","fitness","Hormones and Behavior 116 (2019) 104577 8 overwinter survival (Wey et al., 2015), which reinforces that FGMs are reliable proxies for female fitness in free-living yellow-bellied marmots and supports the cort-fitness hypothesis (Bonier et al., 2009a, 2010). "
"29","fitness","A negative association between glucocorticoid baseline levels and fitness has been found in other species, such as mice (Maguire and Mody, 2016), barn swallows (Hirundo rustica; Jenni-Eiermann et al., 2008), and tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata; Williams et al., 2008). "
"30","fitness","However, associations between fitness and baseline glucocorticoids give conflicting results depending on the species, individual life history stage and sex (Bonier et al., 2009a, b). "
"31","fitness","This suggested hypothesis follows the rationale of the experience constraint hypothesis (Curio, 1983; Forslund and Part, 1995), where female marmots could learn from experience how to use physiological or environmental cues to increase pup fitness. "
"32","fitness","Previous work has shown that the interaction between maternal age and FGM also determines offspring personality (Petelle et al., 2017), and, if changes on offspring phenotype enhance their fitness, marmot maternal behavior may support the Predictive Adaptive Response (PAR) hypothesis. "
"33","fitness","Females with high FGM levels had offspring with lower annual survival and therefore have an overall lower reproductive success, which supports the cort-fitness hypothesis. "
