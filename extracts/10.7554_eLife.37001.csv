"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","Taken together, our analyses of teleost scale developmental genetics using zebrafish are consistent with a single origin of skin patterning mechanisms in ancient fishes that has been conserved in extant vertebrates, even as the final adult morphology of feathers, hairs and scales appear wildly divergent. "
"2","wild","Postembryonic staging of wild-type goldfish, with brief reference to skeletal systems. "
"3","mutant","To elucidate regulatory linkages between these pathways we used the zebrafish nkt mutant line, harboring a presumptive eda loss of function allele (Harris et al., 2008). nkt Figure 2 continued detected in a patch of epidermal cells in prospective scale regions (pre scale). "
"4","mutant","(B) In Eda mutant (nkt/nkt) larvae, 7x:TCF:mCherry expression was patterned into spots (arrows), although no dSFCs developed (n = 6). "
"5","mutant","(D,D’) Scale-less Eda mutant (nkt/nkt) larvae of similar size had patterned expression of lef1 (arrows) in basal epidermal (ep) and dermal (d) cells (n = 4 of 6). "
"6","mutant","DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37001 7 of 22 Research article Developmental Biology Evolutionary Biology mutants lacked overt indications of scale morphogenesis and sp7:EGFP+ dSFCs in the skin, in addition to having impaired fin outgrowth (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). "
"7","mutant","Yet, live imaging of sp7: EGFP; 7xTCF:mCherry transgene expression and in situ hybridization against lef1 showed that Wnt/ b-catenin activity was patterned into spots in the epidermis of scale-less nkt mutants (Figure 3A– 3D). "
"8","mutant","Wnt/b-catenin targets were initially expressed in scale-appropriate patterns in nkt mutants, yet further rows were not formed and expression domains did not polarize. "
"9","mutant","Lack of edar expression in Wnt/b-catenin inhibited fish, taken together with residual Wnt activity in nkt mutants that nevertheless formed no scales, suggested that a lack of Eda pathway signaling is the primary reason that scales do not develop in Wnt inhibited fish. "
"10","mutant","Fgf-dependent differentiation of scale forming cells requires Wnt/bcatenin signaling Fgf signaling has been implicated in skin appendage development of amniotes (Huh et al., 2013; Mandler and Neubüser, 2004; Petiot et al., 2003) and in scale development of teleosts: zebrafish harboring mutations simultaneously in fgfr1a and fgf20a have scales that are smaller than normal, whereas fish mutant for fgfr1a alone have scales that are larger than normal. "
"11","mutant","(C) hag/+ mutants overexpress Fgf8a and had disorganized differentiation of sp7:EGFP+ dSFCs (n = 6). "
"12","mutant","(D) dSFCs did not appear in hag/+ mutant skin with hs:dkk1 induction (n = 12). "
"13","mutant","(E) Loss of Eda signaling in nkt/nkt mutants did not prevent differentiation of sp7:EGFP+ scale forming cells, likely owing to residual Wnt activity in the skin (n = 12). "
"14","mutant","To determine how Fgf signaling integrates with Wnt and Eda signaling during scale development, we used hagoromo (hag) mutants that overexpress Fgf8a in the skin post-embryonically due to a viral insertion upstream of fgf8a (Amsterdam et al., 2009; Kawakami et al., 2000). "
"15","mutant","We therefore assayed expression of HH signaling components while manipulating Wnt/b-catenin and Eda pathways. shha, hhip and gli-D:mCherry expression were strongly attenuated in both Wnt-repressed and nkt mutant fish (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F– H). "
"16","mutant","Since nkt mutants retain epidermal Wnt signaling activity (Figure 3B) but lack Eda, these data suggest that shha expression is regulated by Eda signaling during scale development. "
"17","mutant","Specialized materials including transgenic and mutant lines are available upon request. "
"18","mutant","Zebrafish Hagoromo mutants up-regulate fgf8 postembryonically and develop neuroblastoma. "
"19","mutant","Zebrafish eda and edar mutants reveal conserved and ancestral roles of ectodysplasin signaling in vertebrates. "
"20","model","Skin appendages are classic developmental model systems that have been leveraged to generate insights into how mesenchymal–epithelial signaling interactions pattern tissues and affect morphogenesis (Lai and Chuong, 2016). "
"21","model","In addition to being developmental biology models with clear biomedical relevance, skin appendages have been of longstanding interest for their evolutionary significance. "
"22","model","Nevertheless, these serially reiterated, highly accessible organs have yet to be exploited as a model for understanding skin appendage development at a cellular level. "
"23","model","These analyses show that scale development relies on signaling interactions similar to interactions that regulate the patterning and morphogenesis of amniote skin appendages such as hair and feathers, and support a model in which diverse skin appendages of vertebrates arose from a common archetype. "
"24","model","It also puts forward the zebrafish and its scales as a good model for scientists to study so they can understand better how certain hair and teeth disorders arise in humans. "
"25","model","Conservation of molecular mechanisms that regulate skin appendage patterning and early morphogenesis enables the use of zebrafish scale development as a model system for understanding vertebrate skin patterning and morphogenesis with exceptional opportunities for live imaging and forward genetic analysis, complementing existing chicken and mouse models. "
"26","environment","Wnt/b-catenin and HH signaling are required for scale regeneration During normal life, fish often lose scales owing to interactions with other species and the environment, and scales have long been recognized for their regenerative ability (Smith, 1931). "
"27","human","It also puts forward the zebrafish and its scales as a good model for scientists to study so they can understand better how certain hair and teeth disorders arise in humans. "
"28","human","NBP, a zebrafish homolog of human Kank3, is a novel Numb interactor essential for epidermal integrity and neurulation. "
