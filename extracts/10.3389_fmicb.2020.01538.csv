"1","wild","This study delineates genetic variability and unravels gut microbiome complex of wild-collected and domesticated BSF populations from six continents using mitochondrial COI gene and 16S metagenomics. "
"2","model","The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model (Kimura, 1980) using MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018). "
"3","model","Evolutionary divergence over sequence pairs between groups were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter distance model (Kimura, 1980) in MEGA X and principal coordinate plots constructed from the genetic distances using GenAlEx 6.41 (Peakall and Smouse, 2006). "
"4","model","The GTR + I + G model (general time reversible model incorporating variant sites and a gamma distribution) model was selected for Bayesian analysis as determined by MrModelTest V.2.3 (Nylander, 2008). "
