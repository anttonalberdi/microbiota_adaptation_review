"1","wild","This study delineates genetic variability and unravels gut microbiome complex of wild-collected and domesticated BSF populations from six continents using mitochondrial COI gene and 16S metagenomics. "
"2","model","The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model (Kimura, 1980) using MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018). "
"3","model","Evolutionary divergence over sequence pairs between groups were calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter distance model (Kimura, 1980) in MEGA X and principal coordinate plots constructed from the genetic distances using GenAlEx 6.41 (Peakall and Smouse, 2006). "
"4","model","The GTR + I + G model (general time reversible model incorporating variant sites and a gamma distribution) model was selected for Bayesian analysis as determined by MrModelTest V.2.3 (Nylander, 2008). "

"8","disease","In addition, BSF is neither a pest nor a disease vector, and does not constitute a nuisance like other flies (Diener, 2010). "
"9","disease","However, most of the species are not pathogenic and are utilized in several processes such as production of various recombinant proteins and non-protein products, control of infection diseases, anticancer agents, and biowaste recycling and bioremediation (Octavia and Lan, 2014). "
"10","environment","However, information on the genetic diversity and environmental implications on safety of the larvae is limited. "
"11","environment","Many of these beneficial bacteria could be natural constituents of the larval environment or potentially vertically transmitted. "
"12","environment","Although BSF might suppress potential pathogens, it is not clear if other opportunistic pathogens might proliferate in their presence and present potential health and environmental risks. "
"13","human","The 16S data depicted larval gut bacterial families with economically important genera that might pose health risks to both animals and humans. "

"15","human","They are associated with a wide range of ecological sources including; plants, humans, animals, the gastrointestinal tract of insects, fermented foods, drinking water, surface water, and seawater (Ludwig et al., 2009). "
"16","human","For example, Providencia, which is vertically transmitted through the insect life cycle (De Smet et al., 2018) but can also be a pathogen in humans (Galac and Lazzaro, 2011) was most abundant in Nigeria and Thailand. "
"17","human","Although the 16S data provides poor resolution at the species level, it has been able to unravel the families with genera that might pose risks to both animals and human health. "
