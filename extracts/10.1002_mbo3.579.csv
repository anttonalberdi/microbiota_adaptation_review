"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","The functionality and specificity of the primers were subsequently tested on the wild (7) and type strains of bifidobacteria (36) and scardovia (7). "
"2","wild","Very recently, the new genus Galliscardovia from the crop of a laying hen, new species Bifidobacterium apri from the digestive tract f wild pigs and Alloscardovia venturai from the oral cavity of a guineapig were described (Pechar et al., 2017b,c; Sechovcová et al., 2017). "
"3","wild","They were found to be present in the human and animal oral cavity, human clinical samples, urinary tract, porcine cecum, and intestinal tract of wild pigs (Downes et al., 2011; Huys et al., 2007; Killer, Havlik, Bunesova, Vlkova, & Benada, 2014; Simpson, Ross, Fitzgerald, & Stanton, 2004). "
"4","wild","2  | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Strains, culture conditions, and DNA extraction Fortythree type strains of the Bifidobacteriaceae family and seven wild strains of bifidobacteria (Table 1) of human and animal origin were used in the study. "
"5","wild","2.2 | Isolation and identification of wild strains of bifidobacteria Seven strains of bifidobacteria originating from the feces of infants and calves (Table S1) were isolated from colonies grown in modified TPY agar (Rada & Petr, 2000) under conditions previously reported (Killer et al., 2013a). "
"6","wild","3.2 | Classification of wild strains of bifidobacteria The classification of seven wild strains of bifidobacteria through 16S rRNA and pyrG gene comparative analysis is documented in Table S1. "
"7","wild","Classification and phylogenetic position of wild strains of bifidobacteria using pyrG gene sequences correlated with those found on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Table S1, Figure 1a,b). "
"8","wild","Pseudoscardovia radai sp. nov., another representative of a new genus within the family Bifidobacteriaceae isolated from the digestive tract of a wild pig (Sus scrofa scrofa). "
"9","wild","Classification of culturable bifidobacterial population from colonic samples of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) based on three molecular genetic methods. "
"10","wild","Bifidobacterium apri sp. nov., a thermophilic actinobacterium isolated from the digestive tract of wild pigs (Sus scrofa). "
"11","adaptation","Genomics of the genus Bifidobacterium reveals speciesspecific adaptation to the glycanrich gut environment. "
