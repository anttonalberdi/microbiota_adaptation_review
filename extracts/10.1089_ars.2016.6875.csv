"5","wild","(D) Nuclear and cytosolic expressions of wild-type and mutated GATA3 in HEK-293 cells (n=4). "
"6","wild","*P<0.05 for WT-young mice compared with WT-old mice in (A), or NaHS (30 μM) and PPG (1 mM) compared with the control group in (B), and C84/182S and C84/248S mutants compared with wild-type GATA3 in (D). "
"7","mutant","DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the correctness of the mutants at the MOBIX lab of McMaster University, ON, Canada. pFAGGATA3 was purchased from Addgene (MA, USA). "
