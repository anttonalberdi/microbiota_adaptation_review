"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","In this study, we examine changes in the gut microbiome of wild, female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) across different reproductive states. "
"2","wild","While the results of this study indicate an interaction between reproductive state and the gut microbiota of C. capucinus in this population, small sample size as well as the limitations of our understanding of the interactions between the environment, host physiology, gut microbial community structure, and gut microbial community function in wild primates make interpretation difficult. "
"3","wild","The role of gut microbes in satisfying the nutritional demands of adult and juvenile wild, black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra). "
"4","wild","The gutmicrobiota appears to compensate for seasonal diet variation in the wild black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). "
"5","wild","Phylogenetic analysis of the fecal flora of the wild pygmy loris. "
"6","wild","Influence of fruit and invertebrate consumption on the gut microbiota of wild whitefaced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). "
"7","wild","Integrating feeding behavior, ecological data, and DNA barcoding to identify developmental differences in invertebrate foraging strategies in wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). "
"8","wild","Analysis of the hydrogenotrophic microbiota of wild and captive black howlermonkeys (Alouatta pigra) in palenque national park, Mexico. "
"9","wild","Diet and phylogeny shape the gut microbiota of Antarctic seals: A comparison of wild and captive animals. "
"10","wild","Development, diet and dynamism: Longitudinal and cross-sectional predictors of gut microbial communities in wild baboons. "
"11","adaptation","Since reproductive state accounts for less than 10% of the variation in the composition of the gut microbiome, other factors such as behavioral and dietary adaptations are undoubtedly playing a role in how C. capucinus females aremeeting their changing energetic demands. "
"12","model","Capuchin monkeys (Cebus spp. and Sapajus spp.) provide an excellent model for investigating the potential role of the gut microbiota in helping female primates meet the nutritional demands of pregnancy and lactation. "
"13","model","Individual identity was included as a “strata” or blocking factor in the model to test for the effect of reproductive state within the same individual and to control for repeated measures. "
"14","model","PERMANOVAs were also used to compare the effect of the percentage of feeding and foraging time spent on fruit and invertebrates on gut microbial community composition, including reproductive state as a variable and individual identity as a blocking factor in the model. "
"15","model","Pairwise comparisons for PERMANOVA results were computed using the pairwiseAdonis package in R (Martinez Arbizu, 2017), with modifications to account for the use of a blocking factor in the model. "
"16","model","Linear mixedeffects models were used to compare the relative abundance of phyla and the relative abundance of predicted metabolic function pathways using the nlme package in R (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, Sarkar, & Team, 2017). "
"17","model","Individual identity was included as a random effect in the linear mixed-effects models. "
"18","model","Pairwise Tukey contrasts with Bonferroni correction for the linear mixed-effects models were carried out using the multcomp package in R (Hothorn, Bretz, & Westfall, 2008). "
"19","model","Linear mixed-effects models showed a significant influence of reproductive state on the relative abundance of pathways related to energy metabolism (F = 4.708, p = 0.016) and glycan metabolism (F = 4.812, p = 0.015). "
