"1","wild","In this study, we examine changes in the gut microbiome of wild, female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) across different reproductive states. "
"2","wild","While the results of this study indicate an interaction between reproductive state and the gut microbiota of C. capucinus in this population, small sample size as well as the limitations of our understanding of the interactions between the environment, host physiology, gut microbial community structure, and gut microbial community function in wild primates make interpretation difficult. "
"3","wild","The role of gut microbes in satisfying the nutritional demands of adult and juvenile wild, black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra). "
"4","wild","The gutmicrobiota appears to compensate for seasonal diet variation in the wild black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). "
"5","wild","Phylogenetic analysis of the fecal flora of the wild pygmy loris. "
"6","wild","Influence of fruit and invertebrate consumption on the gut microbiota of wild whitefaced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). "
"7","wild","Integrating feeding behavior, ecological data, and DNA barcoding to identify developmental differences in invertebrate foraging strategies in wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). "
"8","wild","Analysis of the hydrogenotrophic microbiota of wild and captive black howlermonkeys (Alouatta pigra) in palenque national park, Mexico. "
"9","wild","Diet and phylogeny shape the gut microbiota of Antarctic seals: A comparison of wild and captive animals. "
"10","wild","Development, diet and dynamism: Longitudinal and cross-sectional predictors of gut microbial communities in wild baboons. "
"11","adaptation","Since reproductive state accounts for less than 10% of the variation in the composition of the gut microbiome, other factors such as behavioral and dietary adaptations are undoubtedly playing a role in how C. capucinus females aremeeting their changing energetic demands. "
