"2","wild","While the results of this study indicate an interaction between reproductive state and the gut microbiota of C. capucinus in this population, small sample size as well as the limitations of our understanding of the interactions between the environment, host physiology, gut microbial community structure, and gut microbial community function in wild primates make interpretation difficult.

"10","wild","Development, diet and dynamism: Longitudinal and cross-sectional predictors of gut microbial communities in wild baboons. "
"11","adaptat","Since reproductive state accounts for less than 10% of the variation in the composition of the gut microbiome, other factors such as behavioral and dietary adaptations are undoubtedly playing a role in how C. capucinus females aremeeting their changing energetic demands. "
"12","model","Capuchin monkeys (Cebus spp. and Sapajus spp.) provide an excellent model for investigating the potential role of the gut microbiota in helping female primates meet the nutritional demands of pregnancy and lactation. "
"13","model","Individual identity was included as a “strata” or blocking factor in the model to test for the effect of reproductive state within the same individual and to control for repeated measures. "
"14","model","PERMANOVAs were also used to compare the effect of the percentage of feeding and foraging time spent on fruit and invertebrates on gut microbial community composition, including reproductive state as a variable and individual identity as a blocking factor in the model. "
"15","model","Pairwise comparisons for PERMANOVA results were computed using the pairwiseAdonis package in R (Martinez Arbizu, 2017), with modifications to account for the use of a blocking factor in the model. "
"16","model","Linear mixedeffects models were used to compare the relative abundance of phyla and the relative abundance of predicted metabolic function pathways using the nlme package in R (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, Sarkar, & Team, 2017). "
"17","model","Individual identity was included as a random effect in the linear mixed-effects models. "
"18","model","Pairwise Tukey contrasts with Bonferroni correction for the linear mixed-effects models were carried out using the multcomp package in R (Hothorn, Bretz, & Westfall, 2008). "
"19","model","Linear mixed-effects models showed a significant influence of reproductive state on the relative abundance of pathways related to energy metabolism (F = 4.708, p = 0.016) and glycan metabolism (F = 4.812, p = 0.015). "

"26","environment","While the results of this study indicate an interaction between reproductive state and the gut microbiota of C. capucinus in this population, small sample size as well as the limitations of our understanding of the interactions between the environment, host physiology, gut microbial community structure, and gut microbial community function in wild primates make interpretation difficult. "
"27","environment","How host-microbial interactions shape the nutrient environment of the mammalian intestine. "
"28","environment","Enteric pathogen exploitation of the microbiota-generated nutrient environment of the gut. "
"29","human","In humans, women increase their energy intake during pregnancy by 8–10%, and lactatingwomen increase their energy intake by 26% (Dufour & Sauther, 2002). "
"30","human","Similarly, protein requirements during lactation in both human and nonhuman primates increase by at least one-third, with adult non-reproductive primates requiring 5–8% of their metabolizable energy to be protein, and pregnant or lactating females requiring 10% of their metabolizable energy to be protein (Oftedal, 1991). "
"31","human","Inhumans, changes in the gut microbiome that increase metabolic efficiency also appear to increase inflammation (Koren et al., 2012). "
"32","human","Additionally, we did not find a reduction in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes as energy requirements increased in response to reproductive state, as has been seen in pregnant humans (Collado, Isolauri, Laitinen, & Salminen, 2008). "
"33","human","The increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria during pregnancy and lactation, as well as the significantly higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria during pregnancy, are similar to what has been reported in humans (Collado et al., 2008;Korenet al., 2012), suggesting an important role for these phyla during nutritionally demanding time periods. "
"34","human","Additionally, data from captive Sapajus apella indicate that capuchin milk is higher in lipid content than that of either humans or closely related Saimiri boliviensis (Milligan, 2010), suggesting that lipid metabolism and uptake is critical for capuchins during lactation. "
"35","human","Increased relative abundances of Proteobacteria have also been associated with high rates of inflammation, low gut bacterial diversity, and type two diabetes in mice and humans (Bäckhed, 2011; Bäumler & Sperandio, 2016; Flint, Scott, Louis, & Duncan, 2012; Larsen et al., 2010; Morton et al., 2015). "
"36","human","Many taxa within Proteobacteria are also potentially pathogenic in humans, including Stenotrophomonas and Roseomonas, genera that characterized pregnant females in this study (Dé, Rolston, & Han, 2004; Flint et al., 2012; Looney, Narita, & Mühlemann, 2009). "
"37","human","This finding is distinct from what has been observed in humans (Koren et al., 2012), but again signals an important role of the gut microbiome in capuchin reproductive nutrition. "
