"1","wild","The composition of the colonic luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota differed between villin-TLR4 and wild-type (WT) littermates. "
"2","wild","Previously published studies by other research groups have shown that mice lacking specific components of the innate immune system such as Nod2, inflammasome genes, or Myd88 are more susceptible to chemically induced colitis and possess altered microbiota compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (28–30). "
"3","model","By using villin-TLR4 mice as a model of excessive TLR4 signaling, we show that epithelial TLR4-mediated interaction between the gut microbiota and the host is essential for protection against bacterial dissemination, epithelial injury, and maintenance of epithelial barrier function. "
"4","model","In our model, we have turned up the volume of TLR signaling in the epithelium by expressing a constitutively active TLR4 gene in the epithelium. "
"5","model","Here, it should be noted that although numerous gut microbiota studies have used murine models to gain an insight into pathological mechanisms of various diseases, direct comparison of mouse and human microbiotas is impractical because of numerous differences that exist between the human and murine gut microbiotas (53, 54). "
"6","model","Toll-like receptor-4 is required for intestinal response to epithelial injury and limiting bacterial translocation in a murine model of acute colitis. "

"
"8","knockout","In the context of TLR4 knockout mice, two separate studies have reported that genetics, maternal transmission, and housing conditions, rather than the absence of TLR4, have marked effects on the stool microbiota of these mice (14, 15). "

"10","knockout","Furthermore, by using cohousing strategies, it has been demonstrated that the microbiota of Nod2 knockout mice is capable of transmitting colitogenic properties to WT mice (28). "

"12","knockout","Gut microbiota is a key modulator of insulin resistance in TLR 2 knockout mice. "
"13","disease","Increased epithelial TLR4 expression is observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. "
"14","disease","Defects in TLR signaling and an aberrant immune response to perturbed endogenous microbiota are a few of the major factors that contribute to the perpetuation of inflammation and tissue injury in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (6, 7). "
"15","disease","For genes encoding transcellular transporters, we found a very significant increase in the expression levels of ion transport gene Clca4 (chloride channel calcium activated 4), a biomarker of inflammatory bowel disease (40), in the colonic ECs of villin-TLR4 mice (see Fig. "
"16","disease","A similar trend was observed in the disease activity index (DAI), wherein villin-TLR4 mice had the highest DAI score, followed by CH-WT mice, and the lowest DAI score was that of SH-WT mice, especially early after DSS introduction (Fig. 6c). "
"17","disease","In IBD, as either a cause or an effect of the disease process, epithelial expression of TLR4 is increased (19–21). "
