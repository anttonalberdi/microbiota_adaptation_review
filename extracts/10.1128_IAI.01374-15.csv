"1","wild","The composition of the colonic luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota differed between villin-TLR4 and wild-type (WT) littermates. "
"2","wild","Previously published studies by other research groups have shown that mice lacking specific components of the innate immune system such as Nod2, inflammasome genes, or Myd88 are more susceptible to chemically induced colitis and possess altered microbiota compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (28â€“30). "
"3","model","By using villin-TLR4 mice as a model of excessive TLR4 signaling, we show that epithelial TLR4-mediated interaction between the gut microbiota and the host is essential for protection against bacterial dissemination, epithelial injury, and maintenance of epithelial barrier function. "
"4","model","In our model, we have turned up the volume of TLR signaling in the epithelium by expressing a constitutively active TLR4 gene in the epithelium. "
"5","model","Here, it should be noted that although numerous gut microbiota studies have used murine models to gain an insight into pathological mechanisms of various diseases, direct comparison of mouse and human microbiotas is impractical because of numerous differences that exist between the human and murine gut microbiotas (53, 54). "
"6","model","Toll-like receptor-4 is required for intestinal response to epithelial injury and limiting bacterial translocation in a murine model of acute colitis. "
"7","knockout","Abreua,b Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USAa; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USAb; Department of Pathology, Palms West Hospital, Loxahatchee, Florida, USAc Evidence obtained from gene knockout studies supports the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in intestinal inflammation and microbiota recognition. "
"8","knockout","In the context of TLR4 knockout mice, two separate studies have reported that genetics, maternal transmission, and housing conditions, rather than the absence of TLR4, have marked effects on the stool microbiota of these mice (14, 15). "
"9","knockout","Using TLR4 knockout mice, we Received 10 November 2015 Accepted 28 December 2015 Accepted manuscript posted online 11 January 2016 Citation Dheer R, Santaolalla R, Davies JM, Lang JK, Phillips MC, Pastorini C, Vazquez-Pertejo MT, Abreu MT. "
"10","knockout","Furthermore, by using cohousing strategies, it has been demonstrated that the microbiota of Nod2 knockout mice is capable of transmitting colitogenic properties to WT mice (28). "
"11","knockout","Although in vivo diseases demonstrate TLR overexpression, most studies have used global knockouts or epithelial knockFIG 5 TLR4 regulates EC differentiation in the small intestine. (a) Histological images of ileum tissues from WT and villin-TLR4 littermate mice at 8 weeks of age. "
"12","knockout","Gut microbiota is a key modulator of insulin resistance in TLR 2 knockout mice. "
