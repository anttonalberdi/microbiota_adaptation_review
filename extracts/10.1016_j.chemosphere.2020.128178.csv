"11","model","The effect of IL-17A deficiency in the testes on the expression of cytokine related to IL-17A secretion and function in a mouse model of fluorosis To investigate the effect of IL-17A knockout on the immune response in the testis of mice exposed to excess F levels, we assessed the expression levels of cytokines related to IL-17A secretion and function. "
"12","model","Hence, it is important to evaluate the mechanisms of reproductive toxicity caused by F using an effective and reliable animalmodel. "
"13","model","We also showed that the expression of IL17A increased in the testicular interstitium of the fluorosis mouse model. "
"14","model","Hence, we selected the IL-17A gene knockout fluorosis mouse model to gain more insights into fluorosis and its effects. "
"15","model","Therefore, the F content in the skeleton is an important index to assess the successful establishment of the fluorosis model. "
"16","model","In this study, when mice (either WTor IL-17A-/-) were exposed to 50 mg/L NaF for 90 d, the F content significantly increased in the mouse femurs, indicating that the animal model of fluorosis had been successfully established. "
"17","model","Recent animal model-based studies have reported that rats or mice exposed to excess F levels experience a significant reduction in weight as well as the liver organ weight coefficient (Boiocchi et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2018). "
"18","model","In our study, the use of animal fluorosis models of different genotypes revealed that excessive NaF intake in WT mice could induce sperm count reduction and increase the rate of abnormal spermatozoa. "
"19","model","In conclusion, in the present study, we successfully established a simple model of F injury as evidenced by the increased F content in bone. "
"20","model","Using this model in WT and IL-17A knockout mice, we were able to demonstrate that IL-17A and its signaling pathways are involved in causing testicular damage in response to fluorosis. "
"21","knockout","Wild type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL-17A-/-) mice were exposed to 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/L sodium fluoride (NaF) for 90 days. "
"22","knockout","Remarkably, IL-17A knockout in mice ameliorated the effects of F on testicular damage, semen quality, testicular morphology, and the immune response. "
"23","knockout","In this study, a model of F damage (referred to as fluorosis) was established in wild type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL-17A-/-) mice to explore the role of IL-17A in F-induced testicular damage in mice and on semen quality, testicular morphology, and serum testosterone levels. "
"24","knockout","These results indicate that the ultrastructure of mice testes in IL-17A-/knockout mice exposed to 50 mg/L NaF is similar to that in normal mice, with no apparent pathological alterations.3.5. "
"25","knockout","The effect of IL-17A deficiency in the testes on the expression of cytokine related to IL-17A secretion and function in a mouse model of fluorosis To investigate the effect of IL-17A knockout on the immune response in the testis of mice exposed to excess F levels, we assessed the expression levels of cytokines related to IL-17A secretion and function. "
"26","knockout","Hence, we selected the IL-17A gene knockout fluorosis mouse model to gain more insights into fluorosis and its effects. "
"27","knockout","Based on our research in this experiment, we also detected the level of testosterone in IL-17A gene knockout fluorosis-affected mice, and were surprised to find that the testosterone levels in their serum were similar to those in normal mice. "
"28","knockout","However, these effects of F on AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 levels were not seen in the testes of IL-17A knockout mice, in which levels of AKR1C3 and CYP11A1 were similar to those in normal mice. "
"29","knockout","More importantly, after knockout of IL-17A, the expression of IL-6 and IFN-g in the testis was higher compared with that in the control group. "
"30","knockout","However, in the IL-17A knockout mice, with the exception of IL-6, the expression levels of these inflammatory factors did not increase after F treatment. "
"31","knockout","Notably, the F-induced apoptosis was not observed in the testicular interstitium of the IL-17A knockout mice. "
"32","knockout","We also demonstrated that NaF treatment in vivo can cause a significant decrease in testosterone secretion, however, this was not observed in IL-17A knockout mice. "
"33","knockout","Using this model in WT and IL-17A knockout mice, we were able to demonstrate that IL-17A and its signaling pathways are involved in causing testicular damage in response to fluorosis. "
