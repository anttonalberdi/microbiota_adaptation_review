"1","wild","In this study, a model of F damage (referred to as fluorosis) was established in wild type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL-17A-/-) mice to explore the role of IL-17A in F-induced testicular damage in mice and on semen quality, testicular morphology, and serum testosterone levels. "
"2","wild","Establishment of the animal model To verify the effect of excessive F exposure on the expression of IL-17A in mouse testes, 8-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into four groups (13 mice/group). "
"3","wild","(A) Histological images of the testis of the wild-type and IL-17A-/mice stained with HE staining. "
