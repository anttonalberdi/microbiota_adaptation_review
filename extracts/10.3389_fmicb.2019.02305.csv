"1","wild","Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type L. reuteri did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). "
"2","wild","Colonoids were treated for 16 h with either media alone, 25% CM from uninoculated LDM4, wild-type L. reuteri 6475, L. reuteri 6475:folC (gene required for pteroate glutamylation), or L. reuteri 6475:folC2 (gene required for THF synthesis) (Thomas et al., 2016) in the minimal medium. "
"3","wild","Using wild-type L. reuteri 6475 and insertion mutants 6475:folC and 6475:folC2 as a model for microbe folate production, the relative abilities of microbial-derived folates to modulate human folate receptor gene expression could be examined. "
"4","wild","2019.02305/full#supplementary-material FIGURE S1 | Lactobacillus reuteri strains (wild-type, 6475:folC, and 6475:folC2) exhibit normal growth, but varying degrees of folate production. "
