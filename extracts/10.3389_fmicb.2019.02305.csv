"1","wild","Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type L. reuteri did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). "
"2","wild","Colonoids were treated for 16 h with either media alone, 25% CM from uninoculated LDM4, wild-type L. reuteri 6475, L. reuteri 6475:folC (gene required for pteroate glutamylation), or L. reuteri 6475:folC2 (gene required for THF synthesis) (Thomas et al., 2016) in the minimal medium. "
"3","wild","Using wild-type L. reuteri 6475 and insertion mutants 6475:folC and 6475:folC2 as a model for microbe folate production, the relative abilities of microbial-derived folates to modulate human folate receptor gene expression could be examined. "
"4","wild","2019.02305/full#supplementary-material FIGURE S1 | Lactobacillus reuteri strains (wild-type, 6475:folC, and 6475:folC2) exhibit normal growth, but varying degrees of folate production. "
"5","mutant","Insertion mutants were cultured in the presence of 10 µg/mL erythromycin. "
"6","mutant","We also included two L. reuteri 6475 mutants which harbored insertions in either the folC gene (6475:folC) or the folC2 gene (6475:folC2). "
"7","mutant","We confirmed that these mutants exhibit normal growth in LDM4 by optical density (OD600nm) and CFU over 48 h (Supplementary Figures S1A,B). "
"8","mutant","Consistent with our previous work, we demonstrate that the 6475:folC mutant is capable of producing glutamylated folate (170 ± 25.6 ng/ml), while the 6475:folC2 mutant is unable to produce folate above the LDM4 media control (16.7± 1.2 ng/ml) (Supplementary Figures S1D,E). "
"9","mutant","Using wild-type L. reuteri 6475 and insertion mutants 6475:folC and 6475:folC2 as a model for microbe folate production, the relative abilities of microbial-derived folates to modulate human folate receptor gene expression could be examined. "
"10","mutant","However, the application of bacterial supernatants containing a non-glutamylated folate (L. reuteri 6475:folC-mutant strain) to human colonoids yielded enhanced expression of the folate transporter RFC (Figures 5D,H). "
"11","mutant","This effect was not observed with the L. reuteri 6475:folC2-mutant strain which is unable to synthesize folate, pointing to the potential role of non-glutamylated folate in modulating RFC levels. "
"12","mutant","In addition to WT L. reuteri, the 6475:folC mutant, which can produce THF, but can’t synthesize a polyglutamate tail, and the 6475:folC2 mutant, which can’t synthesis any THF, were included in the analysis. "
"13","mutant","Our work indicates that bacterial supernatants containing non-polyglutamylated THFs (L. reuteri 6475:folC-mutant strain) results in upregulation of the RFC transporter. "
"14","mutant","Consistent with this hypothesis, the L. reuteri 6475:folC2 mutant, which is unable to produce any folate, has no effect on RFC levels. "
"15","mutant","Based on previously published microarray data (GSE32971), 47 of the 13,580 genes examined were downregulated in the 6475:folC mutant compared to WT L. reuteri (Thomas et al., 2016). "
"16","mutant","Additionally 64 genes were upregulated in 6475:folC-mutant compared to WT L. reuteri (Thomas et al., 2016). "
"17","mutant","(B) Growth of WT L. reuteri and two L. reuteri mutants, 6475:folC which can produce folate, but cannot add a glutamate tail, and 6475:folC2, which cannot produce folate, in LDM4 over 48 h. "
"18","mutant","In addition to WT L. reuteri, the 6475:folC mutant, which can produce THF, but can’t synthesize a polyglutamate tail, and the 6475:folC2 mutant, which can’t synthesis any THF, were included in the analysis. "
