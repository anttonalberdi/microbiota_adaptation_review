"1","wild","A P. gingivalis BCAA aminotransferase-deficient strain (∆bcat) was constructed, and its kinetic growth, biofilm formation, and in vivo colonization were compared with its wild-type strain. "
"2","wild","Alveolar bone loss, insulin sensitivity, and the plasma level of BCAAs of the mice infected with either wild-type strain or ∆bcat strain were further measured. "
"3","wild","In experiment 2, after 1 wk of environment acclimation, the mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 6 per group): P. gingivalis wild type + high-fat diet (wild type + HFD), ∆bcat + high-fat diet (∆bcat + HFD), and vehicle + high-fat diet (HFD). "
"4","wild","The overnight bacterial cultures (wild type/∆bcat) were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 2% carboxymethyl cellulose (Tokyo Chemical Industry) at a defined microbial population of 1 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. "
"5","wild","The ∆bcat strain showed comparable growth and biofilm formation to its wild-type strain (Fig. "
"6","wild","3C), suggesting a comparable in vivo colonization of the ∆bcat and its wild-type strain. "
"7","wild","In addition, no significant difference in alveolar bone loss was observed between the wild-type + HFD and ∆bcat + HFD groups (Fig. "
"8","wild","The plasma levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and total BCAAs were significantly higher in the wild-type + HFD group than in the other 2 groups, and no significant difference regarding the level of BCAAs was observed between ∆bcat + HFD and HFD groups (Fig. "
"9","wild","4A–D). ∆bcat Strain Is Not Able to Induce Insulin Resistance in HFD-Mice AUC of the wild-type + HFD group was greater than that of the other 2 groups. "
"10","wild","The level of fasting insulin of the wild-type + HFD group was higher than that of the ∆bcat + HFD group (Fig. "
"11","wild","Importantly, HOMA-IR was significantly higher in the wild-type + HFD group than in the other 2 groups, and no significant difference was observed between the ∆bcat + HFD and HFD groups (Fig. "
"12","wild","(A) Growth curve of P. gingivalis wild type and ∆bcat. "
"13","wild","(B) Biofilm formation of P. gingivalis wild type and ∆bcat. "
"14","wild","More important, by deleting the BCAA biosynthesis-related gene (branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase), we found that the ∆bcat strain, which showed comparable growth and in vivo colonization but compromised BCAA production relative to the P. gingivalis wild-type strain, failed to aggravate insulin resistance in the HFD-fed mice. "
"15","wild","Although the wild-type P. gingivalis and its ∆bcat strain showed comparable carriage in saliva, their colonization in the periodontal sites needs further investigation. "
"16","mutant","The DNA sequencing result confirmed the success of mutant construction (Appendix Fig. "
"17","model","We established a murine model of periodontitis by infecting mice with P. gingivalis. "
"18","model","Specifically, we established a P. gingivalis–induced periodontitis mouse model and demonstrated that P. gingivalis could aggravate insulin resistance in the high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice, and this effect was dependent on its BCAA biosynthesis. "
"19","model","The periodontitis mouse model was established according to the protocol described by Li and Amar (2007) with slight modifications. "
"20","model","Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated to assess the insulin sensitivity. "
"21","model","(E) Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) calculated by measuring fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin levels in mice. "
"22","model","(C) Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) calculated by measuring fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin levels in mice. "
