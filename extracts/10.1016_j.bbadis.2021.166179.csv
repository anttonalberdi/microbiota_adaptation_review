"1","wild","Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we determined gut microbiota composition in mice with CRC and found reduced amounts of beneficial species of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides in the mutants compared to the wild-type (WT) mice. "
"2","wild","Our study identified specific changes in the gut microbiome that are associated with 5FU resistance in these mice and showed that the gut microbiome response to 5FU differed between wild-type (WT) and the TGF-Î² signaling-deficient mice. "
