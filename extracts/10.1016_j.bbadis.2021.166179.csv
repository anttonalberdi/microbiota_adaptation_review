"1","wild","Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we determined gut microbiota composition in mice with CRC and found reduced amounts of beneficial species of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides in the mutants compared to the wild-type (WT) mice. "
"2","wild","Our study identified specific changes in the gut microbiome that are associated with 5FU resistance in these mice and showed that the gut microbiome response to 5FU differed between wild-type (WT) and the TGF-β signaling-deficient mice. "
"3","mutant","Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we determined gut microbiota composition in mice with CRC and found reduced amounts of beneficial species of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides in the mutants compared to the wild-type (WT) mice. "
"4","mutant","Furthermore, the mutant mice with CRC were resistant to 5FU. "
"5","mutant","Generation of transgenic mice Smad4+/− and Sptbn1+/− mutant mice were generated as previously described [10,14]. "
"6","mutant","Tumors were induced by AOM/DSS administration in all of the mutant mice but only a subset of the WT mice (Table 1). "
"7","mutant","To identify the association of microbiota with defective TGF-β signaling, shotgun metagenomic analyses were performed in fecal samples collected from both WT and age-matched mutant mice before CRC induction (basal) and after CRC induction and treatment (5FU or PBS). "
"8","mutant","Thus, the mutant mice had increased susceptibility to chemical-induced CRC. "
"9","mutant","Not only were the TGF-β signaling-deficient group more susceptible to colitis-induced CRC that was more advanced, but this group was also developed a significantly increased number of tumors compared to WT mice, the individual tumors were also significantly larger in the combined mutant group compared to those in WT mice (Table 1), and the distribution of tumor sizes was also significantly different (Table 3). "
"10","mutant","Additionally, the tumors in the TGF-β signaling deficient group, which includes mice from both mutant genotypes, that had received 5FU treatment were more numerous and larger than those of the WT mice that received 5FU treatment (Fig. "
"11","mutant","We identified a unique gut microbiome signature that is associated with 5FU resistance in mice in the mice in the TGF-β signaling-deficient group, comprised of both mutant genotypes. "

"13","model","Thus, Smad4+/− Sptbn1+/ − mice represent useful models for assessing the role of TGF-β signaling in CRC and for investigating the role of the microbiota in this process and the response to therapy. "
"14","model","Because studies have linked CRC onset and progression, as well as treatment response, with the gut microbiome [31–33], we investigated the connection between these events and TGF-β signaling using Smad4+/ − and Smad4+/− Sptbn1+/− mice to represent TGF-β signaling-defective models. "
"15","model","We selected mice heterozygous for Smad4 because (i) according to data in cBioPortal, >63% of human CRCs are heterozygous for the gene encoding a mediator common to TGF-β pathways, SMAD4 [34], (ii) inactivating mutations in SMAD4 correlate with metastasis of CRC [35], (iii) reduced abundance of SMAD4 is associated with poor prognosis in patients receiving 5-fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy [36,37] and (iv) 5FU resistance in an orthotopic mouse model [35]. "
"16","model","We used a well-established model of chemically-induced CRC [38–40] and studied the microbiomes and responses to chemotherapy with 5FU in both WT mice and mice that were TGF-β signaling-deficient (Smad4+/− and Smad4+/− Sptbn1+/− ). "
"17","model","(A) Schematic of AOM/DSS-induced CRC mouse model to explore 5FU response and gut microbiome in WT (n = 16), Smad4+/–Sptbn1+/− (n = 12), and Smad4+/− (n = 4) mice. "
"18","model","To determine if these findings with the mouse models were consistent with human CRC, we analyzed data from TCGA. >70% of human CRCs have SMAD4 alterations (mutations and/or heterozygous loss) and a smaller fraction (8%) have mutations in SPTBN1 (Fig. "
"19","model","In this study, our goal was to explore whether gut microbiota composition affects CRC chemotherapy response using mouse models. "
"20","model","There are a variety of CRC mouse models for exploring gut microbiome and drug response. "
"21","model","Therefore, we used Smad4+/− or Smad4+/− Sptbn1+/− mice rather than an orthotopic animal model, which adds more variabilities of the host immune response due to the implantation of human cell lines into mouse recipients [61]. "
"22","model","We used a model of AOM/DSS-induced CRC in mice in the TGF-β signaling-deficient group to explore the gut microbiome of mice with 5FU resistance. "
