"1","wild","To characterize the structure and dynamics of heliconiine microbiomes, we used field collections of wild butterflies, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative PCR, and shotgun metagenomics. "
"2","wild","We collected 214 wild adult butterflies, representing 23 species and subspecies of Heliconiini, and characterized their microbiomes by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. "
"3","wild","While many adult Lepidoptera microbiome studies have used reared, captive specimens (6, 12, 13, 22, 27), these may give a biased picture of microbial community structure in the wild (11). "
"4","wild","The wild adult butterflies used for whole-body microbiome sequencing were collected from seven locations in Panama and Ecuador from May to August 2014 (more detail is provided in the “Collection_localities.txt” file at https://figshare.com/projects/Heliconius_butterfly_microbiomes/ 70520). "
"5","wild","Variation of chemical compounds in wild Heliconiini reveals ecological factors involved in the evolution of chemical defenses in mimetic butterflies. "
"6","fitness","Given their potential interactions with gut bacteria and relevance to host fitness, more targeted analyses of butterflyassociated microeukaryote diversity are clearly warranted. "
"7","fitness","Effects of the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha on the fitness of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). "
