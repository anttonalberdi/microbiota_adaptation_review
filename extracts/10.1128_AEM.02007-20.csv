"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","To characterize the structure and dynamics of heliconiine microbiomes, we used field collections of wild butterflies, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative PCR, and shotgun metagenomics. "
"2","wild","We collected 214 wild adult butterflies, representing 23 species and subspecies of Heliconiini, and characterized their microbiomes by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. "
"3","wild","While many adult Lepidoptera microbiome studies have used reared, captive specimens (6, 12, 13, 22, 27), these may give a biased picture of microbial community structure in the wild (11). "
"4","wild","The wild adult butterflies used for whole-body microbiome sequencing were collected from seven locations in Panama and Ecuador from May to August 2014 (more detail is provided in the “Collection_localities.txt” file at https://figshare.com/projects/Heliconius_butterfly_microbiomes/ 70520). "
"5","wild","Variation of chemical compounds in wild Heliconiini reveals ecological factors involved in the evolution of chemical defenses in mimetic butterflies. "
"6","fitness","Given their potential interactions with gut bacteria and relevance to host fitness, more targeted analyses of butterflyassociated microeukaryote diversity are clearly warranted. "
"7","fitness","Effects of the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha on the fitness of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). "
"8","model","We studied adult-stage microbiomes of Heliconius and closely related passion-vine butterflies (Heliconiini), which are an important model system in evolutionary biology. "
"9","model","For example, the obligate nutritional endosymbionts of sapand blood-feeding insects, which exemplify this scenario, have long served as important model systems. "
"10","model","This pattern is notable in part because it weighs against the codiversification model described above and in part because it provides a contrast to the high degree of host specificity documented in a number of other insect-microbe symbioses (42–45). "
"11","model","This study provides an in-depth characterization of Heliconius and other passion-vine butterfly microbiomes, adding a new dimension to a classic model system in evolutionary biology. "
"12","model","We verified that residuals were approximately normally distributed and used a linear mixed-effects model as implemented in the nlme package (84), treating host genus (Heliconius versus others) as a fixed effect and host species as a random effect. "
"13","model","Honey bees as models for gut microbiota research. "
"14","model","Evolution of host specialization in gut microbes: the bee gut as a model. "
"15","model","2019. nlme: linear and nonlinear mixed effects models. "
