"1","wild","The number of TLR2 monocytes that produce tumor necrosis factor  increased in the intestinal lamina propria of wild-type mice following bile duct ligation; bacterial translocation was facilitated by TNFRI-mediated signals on intestinal epithelial cells. "
"2","wild","To assess reconstitution, GFP-expressing transgenic mice under a -actin promoter were used as bone marrow donors with wild-type mice as recipients. "
"3","wild","The entire median lobe of the liver was imaged using a polarizing filter and analyzed using National Institutes of Health ImageJ as described.18 Results are expressed relative to wild-type control ice. "
"4","wild","143, No. 5pared with wild-type C57BL/6 control mice (Figure 1A and B). "
"5","wild","Liver injury s measured by systemic alanine aminotransferase levels was ot significantly different in wild-type and TLR2/ mice 1 day or 3 weeks following bile duct ligation (Supplementary Figure 1), indicating that TLR2 does not mediate cholestatic hepatotoxicity but fibrosis progression. "
"6","wild","TLR2/ mice showed significantly less positive mesenteric lymph node cultures as compared with wild-type mice following bile duct ligation for 1 day (Figure 2A). "
"7","wild","Significantly lower systemic endotoxin levels were found in TLR2/ mice following bile duct ligation for 1 day or 3 weeks as compared with wild-type mice (Figure 2B and C). "
"8","wild","This is consistent with our study demonstrating that the colon shows the largest increase in intestinal permeability following 1 day of bile duct ligation.2 Translocation of GFP-expressing E coli from colonic loops to mesenteric lymph nodes was markedly attenuated in TLR2-deficient mice as compared with wildtype mice, suggesting that TLR2 is involved in regulation of the intestinal barrier function (Figure 2F). "

"11","wild","In contrast, transplant recipients expressing TLR2 n hematopoietic cells showed bacteria translocated to he mesenteric lymph nodes, regardless of whether the one marrow recipient was wild type or TLR2 deficient Figure 3A). "
"12","wild","(A and B) CFUs were counted of mesenteric lymph node cultures (n  8–23), and plasma endotoxin (n  4–15) was measured in wild-type and TLR2 bone marrow chimeric mice 1 day after bile duct ligation (BDL). "
"13","wild","(C) TLR2, intracellular TNF- (n  4–5 independent experiments), and TLR2, IL-6 expression (n  3 independent experiments) of CD45.2, CD11b, Lys6C cells were assessed in colonic lamina propria of wild-type mice. "
"14","wild","(D) RhoA, phospho-MLC, and tubulin expression was assessed in isolated colon epithelial cells in wild-type and TLR2/ mice. "
"15","wild","(E) Occludin, claudin-4, and ZO-1 protein expression in intestinal sections of wild-type and TLR2/ mice were analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. "
"16","wild","Following 1 day of cholestatic liver injury, stain-ing for occludin protein was diminished as compared with sham-operated wild-type animals, as we have reported previously.2 Occludin expression was unchanged n the colon of TLR2-deficient mice after bile duct ligation Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure 5B). "
"17","wild","Similarly, exression of claudin-4 and ZO-1 was decreased 1 day after ile duct ligation in wild-type mice but not in TLR2/ mice (Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure 5B). "
"18","wild","Liver injury as measured by alanine aminotranserase levels was not significantly different in wild-type nd TNFRI/ mice 1 day or 3 weeks after bile duct ligation, consistent with previous studies31,32 (Supplemenary Figure 1). "
"19","wild","TNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice carrying a mutation inNFRI are protected from tight junction disruption in theolon, while wild-type mice show diminished expression of ight junction proteins 1 day after bile duct ligation. illinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice that have a functional TNFRI electively on intestinal epithelial cells show a disruption f tight junction proteins (Supplementary Figure 6). illinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice lose their protection against ile duct ligation–induced liver fibrosis as compared with NFRIflxneo/flxneo. "
"20","wild","However, they still develop significantly less iver fibrosis as compared with C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Figre 6B and C). "
"21","wild","In addition, endotoxin levels were higher in illinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo as compared with TNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice but lower as compared with C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Figure 6D). "
"22","wild","This might include NFR2 or other cytokines and their receptors such as nterleukin-1 or interferon gamma, which are known to play a role in the regulation of tight junction permeability.21 Similar to bacterial translocation, reactivaion of TNFRI specifically on enterocytes increases liver brosis as compared with mice deficient in TNFRI, but he degree of fibrosis is still lower compared with wildype mice. "
"23","wild","Results are expressed relative to wild-type control mice. "
"24","mutant","5TNFRI-Deficient Mice With Reactivation of TNFRI on Intestinal Epithelial Cells Lose Their Protection Against Bile Duct Ligation– Induced Liver Fibrosis To confirm the intestinal epithelial cell–specific function of TNFRI in mediating bacterial translocation in liver fibrosis, we used mutant mice carrying a conditional gainof-function allele for this receptor with an introduced loxP-flanked neomycin-resistance cassette in intron 5 of the murine p55TnfR gene (TNFRIflxneo/flxneo).12 A nonfunctional NFRI allele is engineered to be reactivated specifically in illin-expressing intestinal epithelial cells by a Villin CreoxP–mediated recombination (VillinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo).12 By crossing TNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice with the intestinal epitheial cell–specific VillinCre transgenic mouse, a functional NFRI is selectively expressed on intestinal epithelial cells, as nalyzed by polymerase chain reaction.13 We confirmed the selective reactivation on isolated colonic epithelial cells (Figure 6A).
