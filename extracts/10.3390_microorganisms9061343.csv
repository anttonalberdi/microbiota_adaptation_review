"6","wild","Better knowledge of subtypes of Blastocystis in wildlife is necessary to understand the potential role of wildlife in the transmission dynamics of this organism and the potential role of wildlife as reservoirs for human infection. "
"7","wild","The wild ungulate communities, including deer populations, frequently occur sympatrically with free-ranging domestic animals and are observed in close proximity to human populations. "
"8","wild","Blastocystis has been identified from a wide range of wild ungulates [3], but information on the presence and subtype distribution of Blastocystis in deer are limited (Table 1). "
"9","wild","Previous studies have reported the presence of Blastocystis in wild deer and in deer living in captivity and on farms with significant differences in occurrence between studies. "
"10","wild","The hunt was conducted under the supervision of county officials as part of a wildlife management program. "
"11","wild","Discussion Blastocystis is a common parasite of humans, which is also frequently observed in wild and domestic animals [3]. "
"12","wild","However, the role of wildlife in Blastocystis transmission is not well explored, especially in the United States. "

"16","wild","Deer are a common wildlife species with habitats that overlap with humans and other domestic and wild animals, which creates the potential for deer to act as reservoirs for pathogens among these populations. "
"17","wild","The number of large studies on Blastocystis occurrence in deer are limited, and only two studies have measured Blastocystis occurrence in wild deer populations (Table 1). "
"18","wild","Of the two previous studies which surveyed Blastocystis in wild deer populations, occurrences of 2% and 41% were reported [29,30]. "
"19","wild","These subtypes have been reported in studies of other wild and domestic animals and appear to be prevalent in ruminants [14,15,24,25,32,48–50]. "
"20","wild","NGS has also been used to explore Blastocystis subtype diversity in wild carnivores, humans, captive wild and domestic birds, chickens, wild boars, and pigs with mixed infections reported in 50%, 13.7%, 62.5%, 63.6%, 23.1%, and 15.4% of Blastocystis-positive hosts, respectively [7,14,15,51,52]. "
"21","wild","However, the high occurrence of mixed infections, the high occurrence of Blastocystis overall, and the large number of subtypes present in this wild WTD population could indicate that exposure to multiple sources of infection contribute to infection risk and intra-subtype variability within individual hosts. "
"22","wild","While lower rates of mixed subtype infections and less subtype diversity in domestic and captive wildlife could indicate shared sources of infection within those populations [7,14,15,51,52]. "
"23","wild","However, such a conclusion could only be drawn after more extensive sampling and comparison between other domestic and wild ruminant hosts of these subtypes. "

"46","human","Introduction Blastocystis sp. is one of the most common protists colonizing/infecting the gastrointestinal tract of humans and numerous animals and has a global distribution [1–4]. "
"47","human","The pathogenicity of Blastocystis is controversial, as the presence of Blastocystis in humans has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and/or urticaria, but it is also commonly found in asymptomatic individuals [5–7]. "
"48","human","Blastocystis transmission is via the fecal-oral route, with direct transmission through contact with infected humans/animals or indirect transmission through ingestion of contaminated food and water [8–11]. "
"49","human","The identification of Blastocystis in a broad range of animals, including pets, livestock, and wildlife, indicates that animals could be a potential source of infection for humans [3]. "
"50","human","Ten subtypes have been reported in humans, ST1–ST9 and ST12, with most studies reporting primarily ST1– ST4 [17]. "

"
"52","human","Similarly, ST5, the most common subtype reported in pigs, is only sporadically reported in humans but was present in piggery staff, suggesting that close contact with pigs was associated with zoonotic transmission of ST5 in piggery workers [20]. "

"62","human","Although ST3 was only observed in two samples, representing 2.8% of Blastocystis-positive deer, its presence in deer is particularly notable as ST3 is the most common subtype reported in humans [47]. "
"63","human","The presence of ST3 and two other potentially zoonotic subtypes, ST1 and ST4, in WTD could indicate the potential for zoonosis as well as the possibility of reverse zoonosis between WTD and humans. "
"64","human","NGS has also been used to explore Blastocystis subtype diversity in wild carnivores, humans, captive wild and domestic birds, chickens, wild boars, and pigs with mixed infections reported in 50%, 13.7%, 62.5%, 63.6%, 23.1%, and 15.4% of Blastocystis-positive hosts, respectively [7,14,15,51,52]. "
"65","human","The common occurrence of Blastocystis in WTD, coupled with the observation of a remarkable number of subtypes, mixed subtype infections, novel subtypes, and zoonotic subtypes in the study population, indicates that WTD and deer in general are an understudied population with potentially important roles in Blastocystis transmission to humans and domestic animals.
