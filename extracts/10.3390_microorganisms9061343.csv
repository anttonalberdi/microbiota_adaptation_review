"1","wild","However, no studies of the occurrence and subtype distribution of Blastocystis in wildlife populations have been conducted in the United States. "
"2","wild","More studies in wildlife are needed to better understand their role in the transmission of Blastocystis. "
"3","wild","The identification of Blastocystis in a broad range of animals, including pets, livestock, and wildlife, indicates that animals could be a potential source of infection for humans [3]. "
"4","wild","The multiple transmission routes and the capacity of Blastocystis to infect many avian and mammalian hosts, including wild species, provide the appropriate conditions for transmission between humans and wild and domestic animals [3]. "
"5","wild","However, few studies on the occurrence and subtypes of Blastocystis in wildlife have been conducted, and there are no studies from the United States [3]. "
"6","wild","Better knowledge of subtypes of Blastocystis in wildlife is necessary to understand the potential role of wildlife in the transmission dynamics of this organism and the potential role of wildlife as reservoirs for human infection. "
"7","wild","The wild ungulate communities, including deer populations, frequently occur sympatrically with free-ranging domestic animals and are observed in close proximity to human populations. "
"8","wild","Blastocystis has been identified from a wide range of wild ungulates [3], but information on the presence and subtype distribution of Blastocystis in deer are limited (Table 1). "
"9","wild","Previous studies have reported the presence of Blastocystis in wild deer and in deer living in captivity and on farms with significant differences in occurrence between studies. "
"10","wild","The hunt was conducted under the supervision of county officials as part of a wildlife management program. "
"11","wild","Discussion Blastocystis is a common parasite of humans, which is also frequently observed in wild and domestic animals [3]. "
"12","wild","However, the role of wildlife in Blastocystis transmission is not well explored, especially in the United States. "
"13","wild","Deer are a common wildlife species with habitats that overlap with humans and other domestic and wild animals, which creates the potential for deer to act as reservoirs for pathogens among these populations. "
"14","wild","Discussion Blastocystis is a common parasite of humans, which is also frequently observed in wild and domestic animals [3]. "
"15","wild","However, the role of wildlife in Blastocystis transmission is not well explored, especially in the United States. "
"16","wild","Deer are a common wildlife species with habitats that overlap with humans and other domestic and wild animals, which creates the potential for deer to act as reservoirs for pathogens among these populations. "
"17","wild","The number of large studies on Blastocystis occurrence in deer are limited, and only two studies have measured Blastocystis occurrence in wild deer populations (Table 1). "
"18","wild","Of the two previous studies which surveyed Blastocystis in wild deer populations, occurrences of 2% and 41% were reported [29,30]. "
"19","wild","These subtypes have been reported in studies of other wild and domestic animals and appear to be prevalent in ruminants [14,15,24,25,32,48â€“50]. "
"20","wild","NGS has also been used to explore Blastocystis subtype diversity in wild carnivores, humans, captive wild and domestic birds, chickens, wild boars, and pigs with mixed infections reported in 50%, 13.7%, 62.5%, 63.6%, 23.1%, and 15.4% of Blastocystis-positive hosts, respectively [7,14,15,51,52]. "
"21","wild","However, the high occurrence of mixed infections, the high occurrence of Blastocystis overall, and the large number of subtypes present in this wild WTD population could indicate that exposure to multiple sources of infection contribute to infection risk and intra-subtype variability within individual hosts. "
"22","wild","While lower rates of mixed subtype infections and less subtype diversity in domestic and captive wildlife could indicate shared sources of infection within those populations [7,14,15,51,52]. "
"23","wild","However, such a conclusion could only be drawn after more extensive sampling and comparison between other domestic and wild ruminant hosts of these subtypes. "
"24","wild","More studies in deer and other wildlife populations from other regions of the United States and world are needed to understand the role of wildlife in Blastocystis transmission and epidemiology. "
