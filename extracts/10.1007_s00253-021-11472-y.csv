"1","wild","Compared to the wild-type strain, we confirmed that the expression level ranges of the intestinal development–related genes (Claudin-1, GLUT-2, SUC, GLP2R, and EGFR) and anti-inflammation-related gene (IL-10) in IPECs were upregulated under recombinant strain stimulation, and the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium was significantly inhibited as well.
