"1","wild","Methods and results: In order to overcome physiological colonization resistance preventing from C. jejuni infection, we generated secondary abiotic Nod2−/− and wildtype (WT) mice by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. "
"2","wild","A plethora of wild and domestic animals harbor C. jejuni as commensal bacteria within their intestinal microbiota. "
"3","wild","Generation of secondary abiotic mice and C. jejuni infection Female Nod2 deficient (Nod2−/−) mice (in C57BL/6j background) and matched wildtype mice were reared and maintained within the same specific pathogen free (SPF) unit of the Forschungseinrichtungen für Experimentelle Medizin (FEM, Charité-University Medicine Berlin).
