"1","wild","Conclusions: Our results suggested that viromes might be potentially used as markers of lentiviral disease progression in wild gorilla populations. "
"2","wild","Retrovirology (2018) 15:19 Although SIVs have been referred to as immunodeficiency viruses, the clinical manifestations in SIV-infected hosts were not reported during the first decades when natural infections were initially described in the wild and in naturally infected animals, captive sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys kept in zoos or primate centers. "
"3","wild","The paradigm of non-pathogenic lentiviral infections has been recently challenged by observations of wild chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) in Gombe, Tanzania, in which infection by their natural SIV strain (SIVcpzPts) was associated with a negative impact on their life span and reproduction [12, 13]. "
"4","wild","Altogether, these findings underscored the need for further studies of wild NHP populations, particularly among apes, because of their highly endangered status and the potential impact of SIV infection on their survival and eventual population decline [1, 7, 15]. "
"5","wild","However, the study of these wild populations is particularly difficult and can only be carried out by noninvasive sampling. "
"6","wild","Moeller et  al. [18] examining 186 fecal samples of wild gorillas from Cameroon, did not find association between SIV status and specific patterns of the gut bacteriome. "
"7","wild","Nevertheless, as gorillas are infected with SIVgor through cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees, it is plausible that SIVgor might negatively impact the health of gorillas in the wild [2]. "
"8","wild","In this report, we used a similar strategy for identifying enteric virome disturbances as dysbiosis markers in wild gorillas to understand the potential impact of SIVgor infection in their natural hosts. "
"9","wild","Furthermore, we herein provide the first evidence of association of specific mammalian virus families (such as Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae and Reoviridae) with presence of SIVgor in a putative dysbiosis context in wild animals. "
"10","wild","Methods Sample collection Twenty-three fecal samples from 22 wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were studied. "
"11","wild","Results Viral diversity in enteric samples of western lowland gorillas To assess the diversity of the enteric virome of wild gorillas, RNA and DNA libraries of 23 fecal samples from 11 SIVgor-infected and 11 uninfected western lowland gorillas were sequenced. "
"12","wild","Discussion Studies on natural history of lentiviral infections in apes have been mostly limited to captive or semi-free ape communities due to the restrictions of working in the wild and to the endangered status of these species. "
"13","wild","However, noninvasive techniques developed during the last 30 years allowed for the study of prevalence, diversity and impact of SIV infection in several wild primate populations [6]. "
"14","wild","These advances prompted us to assess novel dysbiosis markers in previously studied wild gorilla communities, using fecal samples collected in CP. "
"15","wild","Epidemiological surveys showed that SIVgor as well as SIVcpz are less prevalent and considerably less evenly distributed among wild ape communities than the nonpathogenic SIVs in sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys [6]. "
"16","wild","A similar study in wild gorillas failed to show association between SIVgor status and the bacteriome [52], while data on their virome has been, to present, wanting. "
"17","wild","Conclusions We herein describe, for the first time, the virome of wild gorillas, although these preliminary observations were carried out in a small number of individuals. "
"18","wild","Our results suggest that viromes might be considered as markers of lentiviral disease progression in wild gorilla populations and should be further explored on a larger sample set. "
