"1","wild","Conclusions: Our results suggested that viromes might be potentially used as markers of lentiviral disease progression in wild gorilla populations. "
"2","wild","Retrovirology (2018) 15:19 Although SIVs have been referred to as immunodeficiency viruses, the clinical manifestations in SIV-infected hosts were not reported during the first decades when natural infections were initially described in the wild and in naturally infected animals, captive sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys kept in zoos or primate centers. "
"3","wild","The paradigm of non-pathogenic lentiviral infections has been recently challenged by observations of wild chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) in Gombe, Tanzania, in which infection by their natural SIV strain (SIVcpzPts) was associated with a negative impact on their life span and reproduction [12, 13]. "
"4","wild","Altogether, these findings underscored the need for further studies of wild NHP populations, particularly among apes, because of their highly endangered status and the potential impact of SIV infection on their survival and eventual population decline [1, 7, 15]. "
"5","wild","However, the study of these wild populations is particularly difficult and can only be carried out by noninvasive sampling. "
"6","wild","Moeller et  al. [18] examining 186 fecal samples of wild gorillas from Cameroon, did not find association between SIV status and specific patterns of the gut bacteriome. "
"7","wild","Nevertheless, as gorillas are infected with SIVgor through cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees, it is plausible that SIVgor might negatively impact the health of gorillas in the wild [2]. "
"8","wild","In this report, we used a similar strategy for identifying enteric virome disturbances as dysbiosis markers in wild gorillas to understand the potential impact of SIVgor infection in their natural hosts. "
"9","wild","Furthermore, we herein provide the first evidence of association of specific mammalian virus families (such as Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae and Reoviridae) with presence of SIVgor in a putative dysbiosis context in wild animals. "
"10","wild","Methods Sample collection Twenty-three fecal samples from 22 wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were studied. "
"11","wild","Results Viral diversity in enteric samples of western lowland gorillas To assess the diversity of the enteric virome of wild gorillas, RNA and DNA libraries of 23 fecal samples from 11 SIVgor-infected and 11 uninfected western lowland gorillas were sequenced. "
"12","wild","Discussion Studies on natural history of lentiviral infections in apes have been mostly limited to captive or semi-free ape communities due to the restrictions of working in the wild and to the endangered status of these species. "
"13","wild","However, noninvasive techniques developed during the last 30 years allowed for the study of prevalence, diversity and impact of SIV infection in several wild primate populations [6]. "
"14","wild","These advances prompted us to assess novel dysbiosis markers in previously studied wild gorilla communities, using fecal samples collected in CP. "
"15","wild","Epidemiological surveys showed that SIVgor as well as SIVcpz are less prevalent and considerably less evenly distributed among wild ape communities than the nonpathogenic SIVs in sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys [6]. "
"16","wild","A similar study in wild gorillas failed to show association between SIVgor status and the bacteriome [52], while data on their virome has been, to present, wanting. "
"17","wild","Conclusions We herein describe, for the first time, the virome of wild gorillas, although these preliminary observations were carried out in a small number of individuals. "
"18","wild","Our results suggest that viromes might be considered as markers of lentiviral disease progression in wild gorilla populations and should be further explored on a larger sample set. "

"25","disease","Conversely, mammalian viral families, such as Herpesviridae and Reoviridae, previously associated with gutand several mammalian diseases were significantly more abundant (p < 0.003) in the SIVgor-infected group. "
"26","disease","Conclusions: Our results suggested that viromes might be potentially used as markers of lentiviral disease progression in wild gorilla populations. "
"27","disease","The diverse mammalian viral families, herein described in SIVgor-infected gorillas, may play a pivotal role in a disease progression still unclear in these animals but already well characterized in pathogenic lentiviral infections in other organisms. "
"28","disease","Despite high SIV viral loads, individuals of these species have been initially reported as effective controllers of disease progression [7–9]. "
"29","disease","However, following the experimental or accidental SIV infections of Asian macaques (that are not natural reservoirs of lentiviruses), these latter primates developed an AIDS-like disease that was very similar to the human condition [10, 11]. "
"30","disease","In humans, HIV infection is markedly associated with expansion of enteric adenoviruses and significant loss of enteric bacterial diversity and richness, clearly involved in disease progression [16]. "
"31","disease","By combining noninvasive sampling and NGS approaches, Handley et al. [19] reported the expansion of the enteric virome associated with disease progression in an AIDS-like context in rhesus macaques, but not with the nonpathogenic SIV infection of African green monkeys. "
"32","disease","These findings showed that pathogenic SIV infection was associated with an enteropathy that contributed to the AIDS-like disease progression seen in macaques [19]. "
"33","disease","Detection of disease-associated viruses in SIVgor-infected gorillas A specific assessment of mammalian viral families previously associated with intestinal disease in their hosts was conducted in the studied specimens. "
"34","disease","Mammalian viral families that have been associated with gut and other diseases in humans [27–44] were also significantly more abundant in the SIVgor-infected group (p < 0.003), like Herpesviridae and Reoviridae, while only the Rhabdoviridae was more abundantly recovered in the uninfected group (p < 0.003). "
"35","disease","Moreover, the bacteriophage community, intrinsically linked with the bacteriome, can be an indicator of the general stability of the gut microbiome in a disease context. "
"36","disease","Mammalian viruses, on the other hand, might be important markers of disease progression despite their low frequency found during annotation. "
"37","disease","This was the case of SIV-infected rhesus macaques that presented unsuspected adenovirus infection associated with intestinal disease and enteric epithelial pathology, as well as enteric parvoviruses and advanced AIDS [19]. "
"38","disease","Currently SIVcpz, like HIV-1, is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in infected chimpanzee communities [12, 13, 50], in association to compositional changes of the bacteriome rather than the virome, with disease progression with known (or suspected) immunodeficiency in late stages [51]. "
"39","disease","The microbiome of SIVgorinfected animals must be further explored to validate present findings and to confirm whether virome dysbiosis might be consistent with the characteristic disease profile observed in SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees [17], the more classic pathogenic SIVmac infection in rhesus macaques, and HIV-1 infection in humans. "
"40","disease","The diverse mammalian viral families, herein described for the first time in SIVgor-infected gorillas, may play a pivotal role in a disease progression that still remains unclear in these animals but is already well characterized in pathogenic lentiviral infections. "

"45","human","With the advent and dissemination of new generation sequencing technologies, novel promising markers of immune deficiency have been explored in human and nonhuman primate species, showing changes in the microbiome (dysbiosis) that might be associated with pathogenic conditions. "
"46","human","Background The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 have arisen from multiple zoonotic transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) circulating in African non-human primates (NHP) to humans. "
"47","human","Likewise, at least nine independent transmissions between sooty mangabeys from West Africa and humans have already been described, originating the different HIV-2 groups found in humans [3–5]. "
"48","human","However, following the experimental or accidental SIV infections of Asian macaques (that are not natural reservoirs of lentiviruses), these latter primates developed an AIDS-like disease that was very similar to the human condition [10, 11]. "
"49","human","Moreover, retrospective analysis of conserved tissues from dead SIVcpzPts-infected animals showed signs of immune deficiency similar to those found in AIDS-affected humans [13]. "
"50","human","With the advent and dissemination of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, novel and promising markers of immune deficiency have been explored in humans and NHP species, notably changes in the microbiome (dysbiosis) potentially associated with pathogenic conditions. "

"
"53","human","These distribution disparities raise the possibility that apes may not be the natural reservoirs of these viruses, and that might be subjected to pathogenic conditions similar to those in other non-natural lentiviral hosts like humans and rhesus macaques [15, 19, 48, 49]. "
