"1","wild","In the absence of a functional Treg response or IL-10 receptor signaling, the same bacteria that induced a Treg response in wild-type animals now induced T helper type 17 responses, without intestinal inflammation. "
"2","wild","Germ-free mice were raised and housed in flexible-film isolators maintained under positive pressure by ventilation with HEPA-filtered air.3,4 Importantly, one is not restricted to working with a single strain of wild-type mice for these studies, because almost any mouse strain can be made germ-free by transferring embryos from the strain of interest at the two-cell stage into germ-free pseudo-pregnant females. "
"3","wild","These Treg increases are therefore selective for the mucosal immune system and were shown to be a general phenomenon, found in a series of different wild-type mouse strains. "
"4","wild","We did not see significant increases in Th1 or Th17 cells following ASF colonization in any of the wild-type mouse strains that we tested. "
"5","wild","In fact, in this study, we found that although the proportion of natural (Helios+) Treg in the lamina propria of germ-free SMARTA mice was equal to that in germ-free wild-type mice, SMARTA mice failed to expand and 354 Gut Microbes Volume 2 Issue 6 Â© 2012 Landes Bioscience. "
"6","wild","However, we refined the experiment by transferring sorted wildtype Treg cells into germ-free SMARTA animals through intravenous injection prior to colonization: this showed that restoring Treg competence protected SMARTA mice from the induction of Th1 and Th17 responses as they became colonized with commensal bacteria. "
"7","wild","The abundance (determined by 16S rRNA sequencing) and the behavior (determined by electron microscopy) of the ASF species in wild-type and SMARTA mice was identical. "
"8","wild","Importantly, the intestinal Th17 (and Th1) responses observed in SFB-colonized wild-type or ASF-colonized SMARTAmice are not overtly pro-inflammatory since no intestinal inflammation was observed. "
"9","wild","We did not detect any difference in the amount of total IgA secreted into the lumen of wild-type or SMARTA mice following ASF colonization (Fig. "
"10","wild","ASF-colonized wild-type C57BL/6 and SMARTA mice were treated with 2% DSS in drinking water for seven days and allowed to recover for three days without DSS. "
"11","wild","This treatment induced a massive Treg response in the colon lamina propria of wild-type mice with no induction of Th1 or Th17 cells. "
"12","wild","Germ-free wild-type C57BL/6 and Treg-defective SMARTA mice were colonized with ASF for 28 d. "

"16","adaptation","This combination of bacterial species provides a simple balanced physiological flora that colonizes the gut and limits the variability that is associated with more complex intestinal colonization.15 To define physiological intestinal CD4+ T cell adaptations following colonization with this ASF, we co-housed adult germfree mice with an ASF-colonized sentinel for four weeks. "
"17","adaptation","This finding was consistent with recent reports showing that Th17 cells are directly controlled through intrinsic IL-10R signaling.19,20 Encouraged by the compartmentalized Treg response and the absence of Th1 and Th17 responses following ASF colonization we reasoned that this was a realistic model for intestinal T cell adaptation in response to truly benign commensal colonization without the occurrence of intestinal inflammation. "
"18","adaptation","Of course, this on its own did not prove that defective Treg induction was the cause of the CD4+ subset disequilibrium, because the SMARTA mouse might have had other defective immune adaptations upon colonisation. "
"19","adaptation","Therefore, we hypothesize that intestinal CD4+ T cell adaptations in response to bacterial colonization are a continuum ranging from pure Treg responses to a mixture of Treg and non-inflammatory Th17 (or Th1) effector responses depending on the bacterial species present. "
"20","adaptation","The idea of Th17 cells being tissue protective is not new since IL-22, a Th17-derived cytokine, has been previously demonstrated to protect mice from inflammatory bowel disease.25 In addition, although intestinal Th17 responses have been suggested to promote experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),26 they have also been demonstrated to be protective following infection with Citrobacter rodentium.8 Similar to our findings, Clostridiamediated Treg responses have been shown to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis in SPF mice that contained Clostridia compared with SPF mice not harboring a significant amount of Clostridia.10 Conclusion Taken together, intestinal and systemic CD4+ T cell adaptations to intestinal colonization with specific bacterial species have been studied in a variety of systems.7,8,10,24,27,28 Depending on the model used, different subsets of the CD4+ T cell compartment seemed to provide the dominant response following colonization. "
"21","adaptation","We believe that these models will continue to allow us to dissect the immunological adaptations in response to commensal colonization in increasing detail to understand and treat the different consequences of our intestinal microbiota on our health. "
