"2","wild","For example, Bacteroidetes made up 24–68 % of the sequences in three seal species (Glad et al. 2010a) and have been shown to be one of the dominant groups in many faecal and intestinal studies from a variety of animals, such as the yak (Bos grunniens) (An et al. 2005), the Jinnan cow (Bos taurus) (An et al. 2005), the horse (Daly et al. 2001), the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) (Sundset et al. 2004) and the wild wolf (Canis lupus) (Zhang and Chen 2010).
