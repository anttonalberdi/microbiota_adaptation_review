"1","wild","For terrestrial animal production, potential sources consist of feed, humans, water, air/dust, soil, wildlife, rodents, arthropods and equipment. "
"2","wild","Potential sources for this sector include soil, dust, farm animals, wildlife, arthropods, workers, equipment and process water. "
"3","wild","Pastures, soil, surface water, drinking water, air, dust, wildlife or other domestic animal species are other potential sources of higher relevance for animals kept outdoor as compared to closed facilities. "
"4","wild","These highest priority bacteria have been isolated from a range of sources, including manure, water, workers and wildlife at primary production, as well as transport, lairage, slaughter and meat processing at post-harvest level. "
"5","wild","In livestock production, preventing transmission from other animals (e.g. rodents, arthropods and wild birds), dust, feed or surface run-off water, as well as proper implementation of cleaning/disinfection, and hygienic procedures for workers are relevant. "
"6","wild","In addition, transmission between livestock and between wild animals and livestock will also affect AMR within livestock and food-producing environmental microbiomes. "
"7","wild","Other sources include contaminated production equipment, wildlife, rodents and arthropods. "
"8","wild","Crops grown in the open environment are potentially exposed to numerous sources of ARB including wildlife, contaminated irrigation water and fertilisers of faecal origin such as manures and sewage sludge. "
"9","wild","It is becoming increasingly evident that both avian and mammalian wildlife acquire AMR and are vectors for short and long-distance ((inter)continental) environmental transmission (Dolejska and Literak, 2019; Swift et al., 2019). "
"10","wild","Intrusion of wildlife onto farmland and faecal contamination of water used for irrigation by wildlife are likely to be important sources of contamination of fresh produce with enteric pathogens (Gutierrez-Rodrıguez and Adhikari, 2018); the same can be assumed for AMR (Plaza-Rodriguez et al., 2020). "
"11","wild","These sources are, therefore, described first and include contamination of water by animal and human faecal origin, and introduction with soil, air or dust as well as with wildlife. "
"12","wild","In principle, all types of wildlife have been shown to be carriers of ARB, mostly acquired from human or livestock environments (Vittecoq et al., 2016; Darwich et al., 2019; Dolejska, 2020; Ramey and Ahlstrom, 2020). "
"13","wild","ARB are frequently found in wild mammals and birds although the direction of transmission between wildlife and livestock is usually unclear (Arnold et al., 2016). "
"14","wild","In turn, insectivorous wildlife species, as well as farm animals, are likely to acquire ARB from flies (Royden et al., 2016; Nowakiewicz et al., 2020). "
"15","wild","Other wildlife species might act as natural reservoirs for more specific resistant clones e.g. hedgehogs which seem to be a natural reservoir for S. aureus with mecC encoded methicillin resistance (Rasmussen et al., 2019). "
"16","wild","The presence of ARB has also been demonstrated in wild boar (Bonardi et al., 2019; Torres et al., 2020) and other animals which surround pig farms (Allen et al., 2011). "
"17","wild","All in all, the limited understanding of the wildlife intestinal microbiome may limit efforts to assess AMR dissemination, as the likelihood of acquiring a certain species within the microbiome by wildlife species and the capacity to transmit it locally or at long-distance is relatively unknown. "
"18","wild","Typhimurium, which can contaminate grain which is grown or stored on pig or cattle farms because of the activity of wild birds and rodents (Davies and Wales, 2013). "
"19","wild","Furthermore, forage or haylage can be faecally contaminated (FAO/WHO, 2019a), including by wild animals (Surette and Wright, 2017). "
"20","wild","Drinking water Depending on the quality and origin, drinking water can be a source of entry of ARB into animal farms (O’Dwyer et al., 2018; Tanner et al., 2019), especially if drinking water is drawn from local surface water or taken from a private well (O’Dwyer et al., 2018), or if drinking water is not enclosed, with access for wild animals. "
"21","wild","Fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli isolates with similar resistance mechanism patterns were detected from pigs, wildlife and broiler flocks in Norway, despite minimal national usage in food animals. "
"22","wild","Similarly, analysis of management factors showed that for Campylobacter spp., including MDR strains, which are the most common in food animal production, on-farm hygiene, cleaning and disinfection between batches of birds and wildlife control are of greatest significance for poultry farms (EFSA, 2019). "
"23","wild","Wildlife includes all animals with access to the production chain (such as wild birds, larger mammals) but excludes pests typically associated with food production. "
"24","wild","(2019) Different studies support the carriage of ARB by wild animals. "
"25","wild","Outdoor farming may favour the contact between farmed and wild animals, increasing the risk. "
"26","wild","E.g. a study of Clostridioides difficile in wild and farmed shellfish in Italy found antimicrobial-resistant C. difficile, including toxigenic strains causing human disease and strains associated with cattle and pigs (Agnoletti et al., 2019). "
"27","wild","There is a large amount of literature detailing AMR carriage by wildlife, including wild birds such as seagulls which often carry clinically important AMR, presumably due to their diverse feeding habits on landfill, agricultural and wastewater impacted environments (Radhouani et al., 2011). "
"28","wild","However, studies of AMR in aquaculture where wildlife are attributed as sources are very rare. "
"29","wild","Based on expert judgement contamination is likely to originate from the contaminated fish (e.g. through contaminated fresh or marine water), the workers, unclean equipment, unclean water resulting from the processing or ice used for transportation and wildlife. "
"30","wild","/+ Lack of data to support or dismiss wildlife as an AMR source during post-harvest. "
"31","wild","Other potential sources include soil, dust (e.g. originating from neighbouring farms), farm animals, wildlife, arthropods, workers, contaminated equipment and process water. "
"32","wild","Improperly stored feed can also become contaminated at farm level, e.g. by farm equipment, wild birds and rodents. "
"33","wild","• Rodents and arthropods as well as wildlife and companion animals might serve as sources of AMR. "
"34","wild","• Animals kept outdoors (e.g. outdoor cattle, poultry or pig farms) will be more exposed to ARB and ARG from exterior sources such as pastures, soil, water sources, wildlife or other domestic animal species as compared those in closed facilities. "

"121","fitness","Moreover, bacterial characteristics, such as resilience/stress response capability, biofilm formation, ARG transferability, ARG co-localisation with other ARGs or heavy metal/biocide tolerance genes in the same genetic platform, as well as mechanisms to minimise the ARGs’ fitness cost may also be relevant. "
"122","fitness","It was thought that ARGs would impose a fitness cost, and thus at antimicrobial concentrations below the MSC-resistant bacteria carrying the ARG would be outcompeted by non-resistant bacteria. "
"123","fitness","However, recent evidence suggests that several ARGs may impose a low fitness cost, be cost free (sometimes involving development of compensatory mechanisms), or in some cases confer a fitness benefit (Andersson and Hughes, 2010; Li et al., 2020; Kloos et al., 2021; Pietsch et al., 2021). "
"124","fitness","Consequently, ARBs may persist within microbial communities for a duration related to the fitness cost of AMR and general ability to compete with other microorganisms, in some cases decreasing over time and in others persisting, or actually increasing, even in the absence of antimicrobial selection (Li et al., 2020; Perrin-Guyomard et al., 2020; Kloos et al., 2021). "
"125","fitness","Co-selection of virulence traits (e.g. by location of virulence and resistance in the same plasmid), upregulation of virulence genes or improved fitness of the bacteria are possible mechanisms underlying the enhanced virulence of clones that have acquired an ARG (Mølbak, 2005; Pan et al., 2020). "
"126","fitness","Those plasmids seem to have a high fitness cost, thus maintenance associated with a persistent selective pressure. "
"127","fitness","It is often assumed that there will be a fitness cost to maintenance of ARGs that will reduce persistence of ARB, but this is not the case where there are compensatory mechanisms and the fitness cost can vary in different environments (Clarke et al., 2020). "
