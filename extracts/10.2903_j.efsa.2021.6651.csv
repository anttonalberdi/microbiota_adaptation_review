"1","wild","For terrestrial animal production, potential sources consist of feed, humans, water, air/dust, soil, wildlife, rodents, arthropods and equipment. "
"2","wild","Potential sources for this sector include soil, dust, farm animals, wildlife, arthropods, workers, equipment and process water. "
"3","wild","Pastures, soil, surface water, drinking water, air, dust, wildlife or other domestic animal species are other potential sources of higher relevance for animals kept outdoor as compared to closed facilities. "
"4","wild","These highest priority bacteria have been isolated from a range of sources, including manure, water, workers and wildlife at primary production, as well as transport, lairage, slaughter and meat processing at post-harvest level. "
"5","wild","In livestock production, preventing transmission from other animals (e.g. rodents, arthropods and wild birds), dust, feed or surface run-off water, as well as proper implementation of cleaning/disinfection, and hygienic procedures for workers are relevant. "
"6","wild","In addition, transmission between livestock and between wild animals and livestock will also affect AMR within livestock and food-producing environmental microbiomes. "
"7","wild","Other sources include contaminated production equipment, wildlife, rodents and arthropods. "
"8","wild","Crops grown in the open environment are potentially exposed to numerous sources of ARB including wildlife, contaminated irrigation water and fertilisers of faecal origin such as manures and sewage sludge. "
"9","wild","It is becoming increasingly evident that both avian and mammalian wildlife acquire AMR and are vectors for short and long-distance ((inter)continental) environmental transmission (Dolejska and Literak, 2019; Swift et al., 2019). "
"10","wild","Intrusion of wildlife onto farmland and faecal contamination of water used for irrigation by wildlife are likely to be important sources of contamination of fresh produce with enteric pathogens (Gutierrez-Rodrıguez and Adhikari, 2018); the same can be assumed for AMR (Plaza-Rodriguez et al., 2020). "
"11","wild","These sources are, therefore, described first and include contamination of water by animal and human faecal origin, and introduction with soil, air or dust as well as with wildlife. "
"12","wild","In principle, all types of wildlife have been shown to be carriers of ARB, mostly acquired from human or livestock environments (Vittecoq et al., 2016; Darwich et al., 2019; Dolejska, 2020; Ramey and Ahlstrom, 2020). "
"13","wild","ARB are frequently found in wild mammals and birds although the direction of transmission between wildlife and livestock is usually unclear (Arnold et al., 2016). "
"14","wild","In turn, insectivorous wildlife species, as well as farm animals, are likely to acquire ARB from flies (Royden et al., 2016; Nowakiewicz et al., 2020). "
"15","wild","Other wildlife species might act as natural reservoirs for more specific resistant clones e.g. hedgehogs which seem to be a natural reservoir for S. aureus with mecC encoded methicillin resistance (Rasmussen et al., 2019). "
"16","wild","The presence of ARB has also been demonstrated in wild boar (Bonardi et al., 2019; Torres et al., 2020) and other animals which surround pig farms (Allen et al., 2011). "
"17","wild","All in all, the limited understanding of the wildlife intestinal microbiome may limit efforts to assess AMR dissemination, as the likelihood of acquiring a certain species within the microbiome by wildlife species and the capacity to transmit it locally or at long-distance is relatively unknown. "
"18","wild","Typhimurium, which can contaminate grain which is grown or stored on pig or cattle farms because of the activity of wild birds and rodents (Davies and Wales, 2013). "
"19","wild","Furthermore, forage or haylage can be faecally contaminated (FAO/WHO, 2019a), including by wild animals (Surette and Wright, 2017). "
"20","wild","Drinking water Depending on the quality and origin, drinking water can be a source of entry of ARB into animal farms (O’Dwyer et al., 2018; Tanner et al., 2019), especially if drinking water is drawn from local surface water or taken from a private well (O’Dwyer et al., 2018), or if drinking water is not enclosed, with access for wild animals. "
"21","wild","Fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli isolates with similar resistance mechanism patterns were detected from pigs, wildlife and broiler flocks in Norway, despite minimal national usage in food animals. "
"22","wild","Similarly, analysis of management factors showed that for Campylobacter spp., including MDR strains, which are the most common in food animal production, on-farm hygiene, cleaning and disinfection between batches of birds and wildlife control are of greatest significance for poultry farms (EFSA, 2019). "
"23","wild","Wildlife includes all animals with access to the production chain (such as wild birds, larger mammals) but excludes pests typically associated with food production. "
"24","wild","(2019) Different studies support the carriage of ARB by wild animals. "
"25","wild","Outdoor farming may favour the contact between farmed and wild animals, increasing the risk. "
"26","wild","E.g. a study of Clostridioides difficile in wild and farmed shellfish in Italy found antimicrobial-resistant C. difficile, including toxigenic strains causing human disease and strains associated with cattle and pigs (Agnoletti et al., 2019). "
"27","wild","There is a large amount of literature detailing AMR carriage by wildlife, including wild birds such as seagulls which often carry clinically important AMR, presumably due to their diverse feeding habits on landfill, agricultural and wastewater impacted environments (Radhouani et al., 2011). "
"28","wild","However, studies of AMR in aquaculture where wildlife are attributed as sources are very rare. "
"29","wild","Based on expert judgement contamination is likely to originate from the contaminated fish (e.g. through contaminated fresh or marine water), the workers, unclean equipment, unclean water resulting from the processing or ice used for transportation and wildlife. "
"30","wild","/+ Lack of data to support or dismiss wildlife as an AMR source during post-harvest. "
"31","wild","Other potential sources include soil, dust (e.g. originating from neighbouring farms), farm animals, wildlife, arthropods, workers, contaminated equipment and process water. "
"32","wild","Improperly stored feed can also become contaminated at farm level, e.g. by farm equipment, wild birds and rodents. "
"33","wild","• Rodents and arthropods as well as wildlife and companion animals might serve as sources of AMR. "
"34","wild","• Animals kept outdoors (e.g. outdoor cattle, poultry or pig farms) will be more exposed to ARB and ARG from exterior sources such as pastures, soil, water sources, wildlife or other domestic animal species as compared those in closed facilities. "

"121","fitness","Moreover, bacterial characteristics, such as resilience/stress response capability, biofilm formation, ARG transferability, ARG co-localisation with other ARGs or heavy metal/biocide tolerance genes in the same genetic platform, as well as mechanisms to minimise the ARGs’ fitness cost may also be relevant. "
"122","fitness","It was thought that ARGs would impose a fitness cost, and thus at antimicrobial concentrations below the MSC-resistant bacteria carrying the ARG would be outcompeted by non-resistant bacteria. "
"123","fitness","However, recent evidence suggests that several ARGs may impose a low fitness cost, be cost free (sometimes involving development of compensatory mechanisms), or in some cases confer a fitness benefit (Andersson and Hughes, 2010; Li et al., 2020; Kloos et al., 2021; Pietsch et al., 2021). "
"124","fitness","Consequently, ARBs may persist within microbial communities for a duration related to the fitness cost of AMR and general ability to compete with other microorganisms, in some cases decreasing over time and in others persisting, or actually increasing, even in the absence of antimicrobial selection (Li et al., 2020; Perrin-Guyomard et al., 2020; Kloos et al., 2021). "
"125","fitness","Co-selection of virulence traits (e.g. by location of virulence and resistance in the same plasmid), upregulation of virulence genes or improved fitness of the bacteria are possible mechanisms underlying the enhanced virulence of clones that have acquired an ARG (Mølbak, 2005; Pan et al., 2020). "
"126","fitness","Those plasmids seem to have a high fitness cost, thus maintenance associated with a persistent selective pressure. "
"127","fitness","It is often assumed that there will be a fitness cost to maintenance of ARGs that will reduce persistence of ARB, but this is not the case where there are compensatory mechanisms and the fitness cost can vary in different environments (Clarke et al., 2020). "

"209","environment","In particular, the Panel was asked: 1) to identify the main environmental sources and transmission routes leading to the contamination of foods of animal and non-animal origin with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and/or resistance determinants/genes (ARGs) (ToR1); 2) to identify the ARB and/or ARGs of highest priority for public health contaminating food through the environmental routes identified, as well as the main risk factors influencing their occurrence and persistence in food-producing environments and food (ToR2); 3) to review and, if possible, assess the impact of strategies and options to mitigate the risk of emergence, spread and food-borne transmission of those ARB (ToR3); 4) to identify data gaps influencing the assessment of food chain-related AMR risks posed by the environment and provide recommendations to inform future EU research priorities on this topic (ToR4). "
"210","environment","For the purpose of this mandate, food-producing environments were defined as environments where food of animal or non-animal origin is produced or processed, at both preharvest (primary production) and post-harvest level (processing: e.g. slaughterhouses, processing plants). "

"242","environment","Major international organisations such as WHO, FAO and OIE have also recognised the need to further discuss and investigate this matter.5 Codex Alimentarius is reviewing and updating its standards and guidelines to ensure a more integrated and multidisciplinary approach to AMR.6 Humans can acquire antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) from many different sources and routes, including human-to-human transmission, direct contact with food-producing animals and pets, foodborne transmission and via the environment. "
"243","environment","In the last years, increasing importance has been attributed to the role of the environment as a source of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria/genes for both humans and animals, and to the need to tackle AMR from a One Health perspective. "
"244","environment","However, there are still large uncertainties in the knowledge on the actual role played by the environment in the emergence, spread and persistence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. "
"245","environment","Food-producing environments are defined for the purpose of this mandate as all environments where food of animal or non-animal origin is produced or processed, at both primary level (e.g. animal farms, fruits and vegetables cultivation fields, etc.) and post-harvest level (e.g. slaughterhouses, processing plants, etc.). "
"246","environment","Food-producing environments can be contaminated by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (including resistance determinants and mobile genetic elements) deriving from different environmental sources, such as for example: • effluents (e.g. slurry, manure, air) from terrestrial/aquatic food-producing animals; • effluents and other residues from post-harvest food plants (e.g. slaughterhouses and food processing plants); • effluents from urban and hospital waste-water treatment plants; • crop production and horticulture (due to direct use of antimicrobials). "
"247","environment","Once antimicrobial-resistant bacteria contaminate food-producing environments, they can further spread throughout the food chain through several routes and eventually constitute a possible threat for public health. "

"
"263","environment","However, over the last decade there has been an increased emphasis on the environment with the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) AMR Action Plan (WHO, 2015) highlighting concerns around the impact of antimicrobials in the environment. "

"
"266","environment","In 2017 the United Nations (UN) published a report on Emerging Issues of Environmental Concern, highlighting the environmental dimension of AMR as one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time (UNEP, 2017). "

"269","environment","The white paper, published in 2018, focused on areas relevant to this report including human and animal contamination of the environment, and antimicrobials used as crop pesticides. "
"270","environment","The authors concluded that human and animal waste introduces ARB and antimicrobials into the environment, where selection for AMR may occur with some evidence of onwards transmission to humans. "
"271","environment","The report acknowledges the role of the environment and the risks to food and feed production: ‘although evidence remains limited, concerns are also growing about the impact of AMR on the environment and natural ecosystems due to overuse and discharge of antimicrobials and resistant micro-organisms in manure and waste from health care facilities and pharmaceutical manufacturing, commercial livestock and plant production, and fish and seafood farming, a problem that may be fuelled by changes in the world’s climate’. "
"272","environment","In March 2019, as one of the actions in the Action Plan, the European Commission adopted the European Union Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PiE),8 which focuses on actions to address the environmental implications of all phases of the lifecycle of (both human and veterinary) pharmaceuticals, from design and production through use to disposal. "
"273","environment","It includes some quite specific actions on AMR and identifies ‘the links between the presence of antimicrobials in the environment and the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance’ as a knowledge gap. "
"274","environment","A progress overview of the implementation was published in 2020.9 The EU Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals acknowledges that whilst there is currently no clear link established between pharmaceuticals present in the environment and direct impacts on human health, the presence of antimicrobials (antibiotics and antifungals) may play a role in accelerating the development, maintenance and spread of resistant bacteria and fungi. "
"275","environment","The latter may be a specific concern for food-producing environments where antimicrobials enter soils in livestock manures or through direct application to crops in the case of fungicides. "
"276","environment","The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on pharmaceuticals and freshwater environments recommended that environmental risk assessment includes the risk potential of developing AMR (OECD, 2019). "
"277","environment","Also, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued several considerations related to the approach to be followed to minimise environmental contamination with ARB and ARGs and to the assessment of the risk of antimicrobials for the environment (EMA/CVMP, 2021). "
"278","environment","Whilst the study did not specifically focus on the role of the environment, interventions that reduced AMU in food-producing animals were associated with a reduction in the presence of ARB in the animals. "

"
"280","environment","It was also concluded that manure or organic wastes of human or animal origin have the potential to disseminate antimicrobial residues and ARB to the environment and that vegetables harvested from manured soils can carry an additional burden of AMR in the form of resistant enteric and/or environmental bacteria. "
"281","environment","The FAO/WHO (2019a) report also suggested that metal ions that have antimicrobial properties should be considered alongside antimicrobial residues in terms of probability of selection within agricultural environments. "

"
"285","environment","Drivers of AMR in food-producing environments: prevalence and diversity of AMR in livestockassociated bacteria are a function of AMU and husbandry/biosecurity practices. "
"286","environment","The pressure for selection in the environment will depend on the concentrations of antimicrobials in animal faeces, in antimicrobial crop or aquaculture treatments, or in environmental sources entering food-production systems (e.g. antimicrobial contaminated water entering aquaculture systems) and how long these antimicrobial residues persist in the environment. "
"287","environment","Antimicrobials (and other selective compounds) at bioavailable concentrations equal to or greater than the minimal selective concentration (MSC) are likely to contribute to AMR evolution in food-producing environments. "
"288","environment","The interaction of environmental antimicrobial residues and microbial communities will not be dealt with in detail in this scientific opinion. "
"289","environment","However, it is important to note that the prevalence of AMR in foodproducing environments, dissemination to the wider environment and therefore human exposure risk, is likely to be impacted by in situ selection where antimicrobial residues are above the MSC. "
"290","environment","The impact of low antimicrobial concentrations on AMR selection has been addressed in different studies (Andersson and Hughes, 2014), with some aspects concerning resistance development due to low antimicrobial concentrations (e.g. in feed and waste milk) covered by other published or on-going EFSA risk assessments (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2017; EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, ongoing mandate on specific maximum levels of cross-contamination for 24 antimicrobial active substances in non-target feed; to be completed by 30 September 2021).16 The origins and transfer routes of AMR in food-producing environments are complex. "
"291","environment","Resistant bacteria and associated ARGs in food-producing environments can originate from indigenous environmental bacteria or be introduced by humans or livestock through animal and human waste streams such as manure, sewage sludge or faecally contaminated water. "
"292","environment","In addition, transmission between livestock and between wild animals and livestock will also affect AMR within livestock and food-producing environmental microbiomes. "
"293","environment","However, reduction of AMU alone may therefore not be sufficient to control AMR because the environmental persistence and dissemination of ARB and ARGs is a major contributory factor. "
"294","environment","AMU correlates with AMR in human populations only when high levels of sanitation, and therefore, low levels of environmental transmission occur (Collignon et al., 2018). "
"295","environment","Environmental temperature, which is expected to rise, both in general and in terms of summer peaks as a result of climate change, appears to be another factor that influences AMR bacterial colonisation, possibly due to enhanced survival or multiplication of pathogens at higher environmental temperatures, and heat stress in animals making them more susceptible to infections (Kaba et al., 2020).

"555","environment","Factors for occurrence and persistence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and resistance genes in food-producing environments As indicated in the introduction of this opinion and in Section 3.1, there are several general factors that contribute to the occurrence and persistence of ARB and ARG in food-producing environments. "
"556","environment","AMU has been decreasing in recent years in most food animal sectors, especially aquaculture and poultry, in most EU MSs (EMA, 2020), although intermittent therapeutic or environmental exposure to antimicrobials and co-selection, including by heavy metals used in animal feed, are still relevant factors. "
"557","environment","The cycle of contamination and re-contamination of animals and their environment, with involving faecal matter and skin contamination/colonisation, is considered to be the main contributor to persistence of ARBs in the farm environment and individual or groups of animals. "
"558","environment","Moreover, the organisms found to harbour resistance will also circulate between the animals and different sources within the farm environment. "
"559","environment","Robust organisms such as S. enterica, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., MRSA and Enterococcus spp. can persist in the farm, hatchery or slaughter/processing environment as a result of inadequate cleaning and disinfection, biocide tolerance, especially to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) (Al-Johny and Alkhuzaee, 2019; Aksoy et al., 2020; Pang et al., 2020) recontamination from the external environment or reintroduction by movement of people, replacement animals, wildlife vectors, bioaerosols or contaminated equipment (Persoons et al., 2010; Swaggerty et al., 2018; Voss-Rech et al., 2019; Casta~neda-Gulla et al., 2020). "
"560","environment","Less robust organisms, such as Campylobacter spp., can persist within animal housing for sufficient time to infect subsequent flocks/herds if cleaning and disinfection is poor, but are more likely to persist in the external farm environment, and the same strain can be transferred within and between farms by the movement of personnel and equipment (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2020). "
"561","environment","Persistence of resistance, such as to glycopeptides in populations of bacteria such as E. faecium or to extended spectrum cephalosporins in E. coli, may also involve transfer of resistance genes between diverse commensal, environmental and pathogenic bacterial species and clones occurring within the farm environment (Sørum et al., 2006; Schwaiger et al., 2013), whereas high level resistance to fluoroquinolones in bacteria such as Campylobacter and Salmonella is predominantly chromosomally mediated and persistence is a result of the failure to eliminate specific resistant clones (Monte et al., 2019; Perrin-Guyomard et al., 2020). "
"562","environment","It is often assumed that there will be a fitness cost to maintenance of ARGs that will reduce persistence of ARB, but this is not the case where there are compensatory mechanisms and the fitness cost can vary in different environments (Clarke et al., 2020). "
"563","environment","In the case of fluoroquinolones, Campylobacter clones with resistance may show enhanced environmental resilience and virulence (Whelan et al., 2019). "
"564","environment","Biofilm formation and the degree of relevant gene expression may also be important for persistence of Salmonella within the host and in the environment, including for certain strains of MDR S. "
"565","environment","Infantis is also of interest because of the involvement of a promiscuous pESI-like megaplasmid (Alba et al., 2020; Szmolka et al., 2021) that encompasses AMR and virulence/fitness traits (including toxinantitoxin systems) that are thought to have been involved in the rapid international dissemination of various clones in the broiler industry via environmental routes, despite limited involvement of the AMR in food-producing environment www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 86 EFSA Journal 2021;19(6):6651 breeding sector, and possibly also selected by the regular use of preventive antimicrobials for chicks prior to recent prudent use initiatives (EFSA, 2019; Alba et al., 2020). "
"566","environment","MRSA ST398, is a robust organism that can resist desiccation, harsh environments and standard disinfection programmes and is therefore able to persist in the farm environment for a long period and infect pig herds, poultry flocks and the mammary glands of dairy cows (Ribeiro et al., 2018; Barberio et al., 2019; Rodrıguez-Lopez et al., 2020). "
"567","environment","In plant-based food production, although most bacterial contamination is on the surface of the plant, and originates from the production environment (including inputs such as manure and contaminated water), the processing environment or food handlers, there is also a concern that some pathogenic bacteria (e.g. "
"568","environment","Antimicrobials in the horticultural environment can also become internalised (El Gemayel and Bashour et al., 2020). "
"569","environment","There is, to our knowledge, no European literature systematically evaluating factors determining the risk of AMR contamination in the post-harvest processing environment of food animal products or produce, with most studies being focused on single organisms or a limited number of study situations (Bennani et al., 2020). "
"570","environment","There is little published evidence relating to long-term persistence of ARB in food animal slaughter environments. "
"571","environment","Several different clones of different MDR Salmonella serovars isolated by placing polystyrene mats beneath a poultry processing line were able to persist on surfaces for several weeks and showed substantial biofilm formation (Dantas et al., 2020), which supports longitudinal studies that have identified resident MDR Salmonella in the poultry slaughterhouse environment (Shang et al., 2019), as well as ineffective cleaning and disinfection of poultry transport crates (Moazzami et al., 2020). "
"572","environment","L. monocytogenes strains isolated from the poultry processing environment can also form biofilm, with benzalkonium chloride-based cleaning programmes showing limited efficacy and exacerbating biofilm formation and AMR expression (Cadena et al., 2019; Rodrıguez-Campos et al., 2019; Puangseree et al., 2021).

"580","environment","• Several general factors facilitating the occurrence of ARB and ARG were identified, including selective pressure by different compounds (e.g. use of antimicrobials, heavy metals or biocides), introduction of ARB and ARG via breeding pyramids, continuous cycling of bacteria between the animals and their environment, resulting from inadequate definition or implementation of biosecurity measures and food safety management systems with ineffective food hygiene procedures, e.g. "
"581","environment","• Factors linked to the general resilience (e.g. resistance to desiccation; temperature) and biofilm formation of specific ARB strains are relevant to their persistence in the food production environment. "

"641","environment","There are large numbers of publications and reports that describe the occurrence of AMR in food production environments and the wider environment, including wildlife, and discuss its relevance and potential for mitigation (Manaia et al., 2020; Torres et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021; Ofori et al., 2021). "
"642","environment","As sanitation and hygiene standards decrease, the risk of transmission between the environment, animals and humans increases, which is a driver of AMR prevalence in human infections. "
"643","environment","Even in high income countries, environmental transmission is predicted to be a contributory factor to maintaining ESBL-producing E. coli and plasmid mediated AmpC-producing E. coli carriage in humans (Mughini-Gras et al., 2019). "
"644","environment","Requirements include quantitative assessments that enable estimation of the impact of food production and the wider environmental dissemination pathways that directly affect livestock, food and human populations (Leger et al., 2021). "
"645","environment","The environment, and non-medicated food animals, wild animals and crops are subject to ARB and antimicrobials contamination. "
"646","environment","It should also be remembered that the natural environment is a reservoir of AMR, and environmental microorganisms are the original source of most antimicrobials and associated resistance mechanisms (Laskaris et al., 2010; Forsberg et al., 2012). "
"647","environment","The relevance and relative importance of the sources of environmental contamination, and the fate of contaminants in terrestrial and aquatic environments is often poorly understood. "
"648","environment","Furthermore, the impact of environmental contamination at different stages of the food chain resulting from ARB, ARGs, MGEs or cell-free DNA (Woegerbauer et al., 2020) on the occurrence of ARB in food animals and foods is largely unknown. "
"649","environment","Likewise, the relevance of environmental pathways via food production to human infections, even for known zoonotic organisms, but especially for commensal bacteria and transferrable ARG, is not clear (Dafale et al., 2020). "
"650","environment","As far as we know, there have been no published studies that have attempted to quantify or rank these environmental aspects, although there are descriptive studies that report the occurrence of food-borne transmission of pathogens, such as Salmonella and AMR in food-producing environment www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 103 EFSA Journal 2021;19(6):6651 Campylobacter originating from environmental contamination, including some strains which can be resistant to important antimicrobials (EFSA BIOHAZ Pane, 2019b, 2020; Lynch et al., 2020; EFSA and ECDC, 2021a).

"651","environment","The published European research concerning food-production, including the primary production and processing environment, that has been reviewed for this opinion, has been very much influenced, and biased, in favour of topical aspects of public health and scientific relevance. "

"655","environment","The WHO discussion document on AMR priority research needs (WHO, online) focuses mostly on matters relating to usage of antimicrobials and alternatives to minimise usage, which have already been covered in the EMA/ EFSA RONAFA Opinion (EMA and EFSA, 2017), so this section focuses on aspects relating to the environment, in keeping with the overall theme of the opinion. "
"656","environment","More structured, standardised, repeatable and targeted studies and more efficient methodologies to investigate the ecology of ARB and ARGs in the microbiome of food animals and sources of AMR for the food production environment are required (Cao et al., 2020; Feye et al., 2020; Johansson et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Lima et al., 2020), including the relevance of biofilms (Trampari et al., 2021). "
"657","environment","Scientific approaches need to move beyond surveys that simply identify ARB in the environment towards systematic and harmonised hypothesis-driven investigations that definitively identify sources of AMR and selective agents for food-producing environments, providing data that can be used to assess the risk to the food chain and public health.

"658","environment","Such work should also identify interventions that can interrupt environmentally mediated pathways of AMR selection, acquisition and transmission and evaluate whether current and enhanced management practices and technologies to minimise environmental AMR contamination, especially for management of waste faecal material and water, can lead to desirable outcomes (Checcucci et al., 2020; Goulas et al., 2020; Mencıa-Ares et al., 2020; Ricker et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2021; Pereira et al., 2021; Radu et al., 2021; Youssef et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021).

"
"718","environment","• The concentrations of potentially selective and co-selective residues in manures, sewage sludge, irrigation water and aquaculture environments should be further studied to facilitate risk assessment of the role that heavy metals, biocides or excreted antimicrobial residues play in selection for AMR in the environment of food production systems and wider/natural environments impacted by them.

"
"721","environment","Conclusions ToR1: To identify the main environmental sources and transmission routes leading to the contamination of foods of animal and non-animal origin with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and/or resistance determinants. "
"722","environment","What are the environmental sources and transmission routes for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and resistance genes for the different food production sectors identified? "
"723","environment","Introduction of ARB from these sources into the food production environment may occur. "
"724","environment","• Post-harvest contamination can occur during transport or in the slaughter or processing environment via equipment, personnel and aerosols. "
"725","environment","• In addition to the direct introduction of ARB into food production environments, the wider environment itself is a reservoir of ARGs, which may be mobilised to animal and human commensals and pathogens and subsequently established in the food production environment. "
"726","environment","AMR in food-producing environment www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 112 EFSA Journal 2021;19(6):6651 • For aquaculture, the main transmission route consists of water, with human and animal faecal material as important sources. "
"727","environment","For both AQs • Studies demonstrating and quantifying the introduction of ARB and ARGs from the foodproducing environment to the food chain are limited or absent. "
"728","environment","ToR2: Among antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and/or resistance determinants contaminating food through the routes identified above, to identify the ones of highest priority for public health, if possible their relative importance, and the main risk factors influencing their occurrence and persistence in food-producing environments and food. "
"729","environment","• In food-producing environments, resistance to antimicrobials of choice for the treatment of serious bacterial infections or to last resort antibiotics was identified in bacterial pathogens (highest priority Group 1 bacteria) and in commensals or environmental bacteria encoded by mobile genetic elements (highest priority group 2 bacteria). "
"730","environment","Carbapenems, colistin and glycopeptides resistance was also identified in bacteria/genes from different sources within plant-food and terrestrial animal food-producing environments. "
"731","environment","• Among the highest priority ARGs, those conferring resistance to carbapenems (e.g. blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-48-like, blaOXA-23-like), extended-spectrum cephalosporins (e.g. blaCTX-M, AmpC genes), plazomicin (armA), colistin (mcr genes), methicillin (mecA, mecC), glycopeptides (vanA) and oxazolidinones (cfr, optrA) have been reported from food production environments. "
"732","environment","• Highest priority ARB and ARGs identified in the food production environments could originate from several sources, including manure, water, workers and wildlife at primary production and transport, lairage, slaughtering and meat processing at post-harvest level. "
"733","environment","• Data to estimate the public health burden (e.g. in terms of DALYs) for antimicrobial resistant zoonotic and environmental bacteria is not available. "
"734","environment","Therefore, highest priority ARB was identified on food-producing environments based on the pathogenicity potential (e.g. based on species, serotype or sequence type) and resistance profile to last resort antimicrobials or presence in commensal or environmental bacteria of ARG conferring resistance to those antimicrobials in mobile genetic elements. "
"735","environment","Which are factors that make a considerable contribution to their occurrence and persistence in food-producing environments and food? "
"736","environment","AMR in food-producing environment www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 113 EFSA Journal 2021;19(6):6651 • Several general factors are identified, including selective pressure by different compounds (e.g. use of antimicrobials, heavy metals or biocides), introduction of ARB and ARGs via breeding pyramids, continuous cycling of bacteria between the animals and their environment, resulting from inadequate definition or implementation of biosecurity measures and, for post-harvest situations, food safety management systems (FSMSs) with ineffective food hygiene procedures, e.g. deficiencies in GMP/GHP/PRP/HACCP. "
"737","environment","• Presence of bacterial traits linked to the general resilience (e.g. resistance to desiccation, temperature), biofilm formation, stress response, virulence, compensation of fitness costs and co-location of ARGs and/or genes conferring tolerance to heavy metals or biocides on the same genetic platform (e.g. plasmid) could enhance their occurrence and persistence in the food production environment. "
"738","environment","• Replacement of animals and persistent environmental contamination are important factors involved in recontamination. "
"739","environment","• The microbiota of natural environments, particularly soil, slow-moving water or sediment, is a natural reservoir and source of ARGs that could contribute to the occurrence and persistence of ARB/ARG in the food-producing environment. "
"740","environment","What are the possible strategies and options to mitigate the emergence and spread in the food-producing environment of the antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and resistance genes identified in this opinion? "
"741","environment","Reducing AMR contamination of fish feed should also be a focus of attention. o For post-harvest stages, the implementation of food safety management systems is currently the main mitigation and preventive strategy to minimise the risk • Mitigations directed to prevent ARB and ARGs in different water sources (e.g. irrigation water, surface water and fresh and marine water of aquaculture) include: AMR in food-producing environment www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 114 EFSA Journal 2021;19(6):6651 o Some advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as membrane filtration or reverse osmosis systems are effective approaches to remove ARB/ARGs in full-scale WWTPs. o Attention should also focus on reducing current raw sewage discharges and on improving conventional wastewater treatment (e.g. upgrading secondary treatment plants to tertiary treatment standards). o A multiple barrier approach to protect plant production and aquaculture, including low impact approaches (e.g. constructed wetlands), combined with improvements to existing and more advanced processes for urban wastewater treatment, is recommended. "
"742","environment","• More frequent use of biocides, or increasing their concentration, may control ARB more effectively, but could also lead to increased exposure of workers and greater environmental chemical pollution, and some biocides may co-select for AMR. "
"743","environment","TOR4: To identify data gaps influencing the assessment of the food chain-related AMR risks posed by the environment and provide recommendations to inform future EU research priorities on this topic. "
"744","environment","Which are the knowledge gaps influencing the assessment of the role played by the environment in the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance through the food chain? "
"745","environment","• A large number of data gaps exist in relation to the relative importance of the multiple potential sources and transmission routes for ARB and ARGs in food-producing environments. "
"746","environment","The most detailed food production environmental studies have been carried out in situations where antimicrobial use or production methods and environmental protection laws, as specified by EU Legislation standards, do not apply. "
"747","environment","• Knowledge on the diversity of ARB and ARGs/MGEs is limited by the lack of systematic studies using similar sampling frames and detection methodologies for ARB, ARGs and MGEs and the scarcity of studies that focus specifically on the production environment. "
"748","environment","Therefore, despite a large number of studies that have investigated the occurrence of ARB and ARGs in food production, the role played by the environment is not sufficiently researched and there is insufficient data to support a specific assessment of the quantitative impact of contamination of the EU production environment on foods or public health. "
"749","environment","• Comprehensive, integrated studies, linked to One Health initiatives and harmonised environmental AMR monitoring strategies by means of specific focal environmental monitoring or surveillance points are needed to establish the relevance of environmental sources for the AMR in food-producing environment www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 115 EFSA Journal 2021;19(6):6651 introduction of AMR in food-producing systems. "
"750","environment","Within this topic area, the immediate priorities are to: o optimise suitable sensitive and readily standardised culturomics/genomics-based detection methods for currently important and emerging ARB/ARGs. o define effective sampling strategies for different production environments that will facilitate a meaningful assessment of the occurrence, distribution and level of ARB/ARGs and, based on these studies, to identify efficient sampling frames, sampling points.

"924","environment","E.g. for MRSA, a number of risk factors associated with the farm management and environment have been described such as: trade/acquisition of animals, improper milking hygiene, human carriage, contact with pigs, and others such as production system and herd size (Schnitt and Tenhagen, 2019; Dantas Palmeira and Ferreira, 2020). "
"925","environment","AMR in food-producing environment www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 171 EFSA Journal 2021;19(6):6651 Furthermore, it has been observed that calves can acquire cephalosporin resistant E. coli from bedding materials and that the urine of calves treated with cephalosporins may increase the selection of cephalosporin resistant E. coli in soils (Subbiah et al., 2012) There is a risk of persistently contaminating the soil with ARGs in cattle facilities, which might vary for the different housing areas (Agga et al., 2019). "
"926","environment","Bacteria from the skin and intestinal flora or other environmental sources at the farm (e.g. from bedding or other sources) might be sources of contamination of milk through contamination of the udder that can also result in environmental mastitis (clinical or subclinical). "
"927","environment","However, there are possibilities of transmission to the food chain of ARB, also ARG, originating from the environment and the farm animals through products consumed raw, such as raw milk and artisanal cheeses prepared from raw milk (Alexa et al., 2020). "
"928","environment","The contribution of the environment for such contaminants is difficult to establish as similar environmental sources might be causing contamination both at farm and processing stages and some of the pathogens can originate from the animals (Costanzo et al., 2020). "
"929","environment","For staphylococci, and particularly MRSA, host specificity might be associated with some specific lineages; however, it is known that MRSA are likely to be dispersed in the environment as well as persisting in biofilms on surfaces and within equipment in the dairy industry. "

"932","environment","The type of production will influence the impact of environmental effects among production stages. "
"933","environment","This is theoretically more plausible in farrow to finish herds, where transmission from environmental sources may occur between stages located within the same premises, but nursery and finishing farms may receive pigs from several different sources, which increases the risk of introducing undesirable organisms. "
"934","environment","However, we lack information on environmental presence and persistence of ARB in different herd types or production stages within a farm. "
"935","environment","Despite the evident relevance of the environment, most of the current information relies on studies focused on faeces or intestinal contents. "
"936","environment","Overall, more data is needed to establish the impact of the environment in these farming systems (Woolhouse et al., 2015). "

"
"980","environment","Detection of VRE is particularly important (Braga et al., 2013; Novais et al., 2013) but a high prevalence of Enterococcus spp., resistant to gentamicin or ciprofloxacin has also been reported within the pig farm environment (Novais et al., 2013). "

"985","environment","ARGs in both dust and the farm environment are more diverse compared to the pig faecal resistome. "
"986","environment","Perhaps this is due to the microbial shift occurring in an aerobic environment, which facilitates the growth of faecal Enterobacterales and soil-based organisms including Streptococcaceae, Bacteriodaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Clostridiaceae, which accounted for 58.5% of the total ARG abundance and 75.8% of all assigned ARGs (Mencıa-Ares et al., 2020).

"
"991","environment","The frequent isolation of resistant and multi-resistant isolates from carcasses (Bolton et al., 2013; GarcıaFierro et al., 2016; Fois et al., 2017) would suggest that similar resistant profiles can be found in the slaughterhouse environment (machinery, workers hands and implements, etc.), and there is a connection between Salmonella present on carcasses and slaughter activities (Giovannacci et al., 2001; Arg€uello et al., 2013a; Gomes-Neves et al., 2014). "
"992","environment","Two studies describe the isolation of MRSA resistant to gentamicin in the slaughterhouse environment (Van Cleef et al., 2010) and particularly in workers involved in scalding and de-hairing activities (Gilbert et al., 2012). "

"
"1246","human","Among the ARB involved in human disease that could be spread through food, resistant Salmonella (spread through poultry meat, eggs, pork and beef), and Campylobacter (poultry meat), played a major role. "

"1250","human","1) For humans, the proposed indicators for AM consumption are: total consumption of antimicrobials (limited to antibacterials for systemic use), ratio of community consumption of certain classes of broad-spectrum to narrowspectrum antimicrobials and consumption of selected broad-spectrum antimicrobials in healthcare settings.

"
"1252","human","It is expected that the impact of this uncertainty is relatively low for all sectors, except for aquaculture (moderate), because of the availability of studies within other settings (e.g. human clinical and community settings, wider environment, wild animals and companion animals) showing the circulation of the ABR/ARG considered of highest priority in this SO in food animal production.

"1253","human","Similarly, no robust data is available on the significance of ARG/ MGE transfer between bacteria in food and the human intestinal microbiome, or the significance of such events in terms of human disease. "
"1254","human","More studies are needed, namely to provide data on number and severity of human diseases caused by the list of highest priority antibiotic-resistant pathogens as well as the fraction of those infections that are of food-borne origin. "
"1255","human","In 2019, poultry meat production was largest in Poland, Spain, France, Germany and Italy (Eurostat).65,66 ARB, including human-pathogenic strains from poultry, are regularly found in meat (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2019b; EFSA and ECDC, 2021a), especially from poultry meat exporting regions where control of antimicrobials is less developed (Koga et al., 2015; Campos Calero et al., 2018; Mazka et al., 2018; Rozman et al., 2018; Tansawai et al., 2018; Rabello et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).

"1257","human","E.g. for MRSA, a number of risk factors associated with the farm management and environment have been described such as: trade/acquisition of animals, improper milking hygiene, human carriage, contact with pigs, and others such as production system and herd size (Schnitt and Tenhagen, 2019; Dantas Palmeira and Ferreira, 2020). "
"1258","human","Waste milk is milk that cannot be marketed for human consumption, and this includes milk from cows treated with antimicrobials and also milk from cows that cannot be marketed for other reasons. "
"1259","human","However, as usage concentrations in aquaculture are several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of environmental residues derived from livestock and human excretion, the relatively small amounts used (212 kg in Norway in 2016) may have increased significance in terms of driving selection for AMR in aquatic environments including aquaculture production systems (Bailey and Eggereide, 2020). 73 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?"
"1260","human","Noteworthy is the presence of varied ARGs in manures and in contaminated irrigation water conferring resistance to CIAs, and that are common in clinical human isolates associated with mobile genetic elements, e.g. blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-3, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-9, blaCTX-M-27, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-48, blaNDM-5 and blaVIM-1 (Hrenovic et al., 2019). "
"1261","human","Resistance to newer antimicrobials such glycylcyclines, ceftazidime/avibactam or oxazolidinones may become greater threats in future if transferrable resistance linked to fitness traits emerges in bacteria associated with poultry, or come from human sources and are co-selected through the common use of certain antimicrobials, such as tetracyclines or florfenicol (Freitas et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2020a).

"1264","human","Pig preharvest: ARB and ARGs Pigs are reservoirs for several pathogens of human relevance including Salmonella, MRSA, Campylobacter and Enterococcus. "
"1265","human","The presence of MRSA on pig farms has also been extensively studied (EFSA, 2009b), revealing the frequent isolation of this pathogen and particularly of the ST398 lineage able to colonise humans and cause infection (EFSA, 2009b; Cuny et al., 2015; Peeters et al., 2015; Lopes et al., 2019).

"
"1269","human","Aquaculture production sector Summarised information on antimicrobial-resistant bacterial species identified in aquaculture, both human and fish pathogens, is presented in Table 11 (Section 3.2.3.5) and Tables F.1–F.2. "

"
"1271","human","It has also been shown that direct human exposure to aquatic environments is associated with exposure to and colonisation by ESBL E. coli (Leonard et al., 2018) and direct exposure to fresh waters are associated with increased probability of suffering from UTI infections caused by ESBL E. coli (Søraas et al., 2013a,b). "
"1272","human","The area sampled is presumably contaminated with untreated human sewage (Brahmi et al., 2018). "
"1273","human","A study of wild freshwater fish in France reported ESBL E. coli in 0–85% of fish depending on sample site and species and this was associated with proximity to human faecal pollution (Bollache et al., 2019). "
"1274","human","Shellfish can be contaminated by ARB present in human and livestock waste entering aquatic systems; however, this is a function of aquatic pollution and is largely outside the control of shellfish producers. "
"1275","human","Wild-grown Mediterranean mussels produced in human-impacted waters in Croatia were reported to contain Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporins carrying blaTEM-116 (Maravic et al., 2018). "
"1276","human","This review of the literature highlights the extremely small number of studies focusing on ESBLproducing bacteria in aquaculture production systems; however, it does show that both European finfish and shellfish production systems have reported ESBL-producing bacteria and that in a small number of cases this could be identified as being associated with human faecal pollution. "
"1277","human","More attention has been given to bivalve shellfish due to their capacity to filter large volumes of water and accumulate human pathogens. "
"1278","human","The fact that bivalves are often eaten raw or lightly cooked also increases the likelihood of transmission of ARB to humans. "
"1279","human","Other papers on carbapenemases in Aeromonas spp. indicate that Aeromonas hydrophila and Aeromonas veronii (human opportunistic pathogens ubiquitous in the aquatic environment) associated with aquaculture (Smyrli et al., 2019), also carry a class B MBL cphA which is not easily detected by conventional in vitro susceptibility tests (Chen et al., 2012).
