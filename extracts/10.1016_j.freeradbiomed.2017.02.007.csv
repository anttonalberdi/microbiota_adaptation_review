"1","wild","Finally, we show that sulfide resistance varies among wild C. elegans and other nematode species, suggesting that tolerance to sulfide was naturally selected in certain habitats. "
"2","wild","In the wild, C. elegans is found in rotting fruits and compost heaps, where it is surrounded by various bacteria. "
"3","wild","In addition, we expressed the wild-type genomic region of dpy-11 as control (dpy-11(wt)). "
"4","wild","Expression of the intact dpy-11 gene, dpy-11(wt), in dpy-11 mutants completely restored the wild-type morphology to these animals (Fig. "
"5","wild","Notably, the expression pattern of these constructs was similar to the wild-type construct. "
"6","wild","(A) Expression pattern of dpy-11 wild-type and mutant construct driven by dpy-11 promoter. "
"7","wild","The resistance against sulfide toxicity is naturally varied in nematodes Since nematodes may encounter conditions of high sulfide in their natural habitat [18,65], we next explored the natural resistance of wild C. elegans isolates and other nematode species to sulfide. "
"8","wild","To explore whether wild C. elegans isolates and other free-living nematodes are naturally resistant to sulfide, we measured the survival of ten C. elegans strains (and N2 worms, as controls) and five non-C. elegans nematode species in sulfide. "
"9","wild","Four out of ten wild C. elegans strains showed significant resistance to sulfide compared to N2 controls (Fig. "
"10","wild","6A), indicating that resistance to sulfide varies among wild C. elegans isolates. "
"11","wild","(A) Quantification of the survival of N2 worms, wild C. elegans strains (in blue), and non-C. elegans nematode strains (in red). "
"12","wild","Our studies reveal fascinating natural variation in the tolerance to sulfide among wild C. elegans isolates (Fig. "

"15","adaptat","This unusual combination may have arisen as an adaptation to catalase inhibition by sulfide. "
"16","adaptat","Tiedemann, Local adaptation and pronounced genetic differentiation in an extremophile fish, Poecilia mexicana, inhabiting a Mexican cave with toxic hydrogen sulphide, Mol. "
"17","mutant","Therefore, to identify genes involved in sulfide toxicity, we took a candidate screen approach and assayed the sulfide tolerance of mutants involved in diverse and important physiological processes including: (1) redox regulation (2) O2-responses (3) lifespan regulation (4) locomotion (5) apoptosis & DNA damage (6) superoxide detoxification (7) signal transduction, and (8) sulfide resistance (Fig. "
"18","mutant","Our screen was successful and identified mutants in groups 1–3 that showed sulfide tolerance. "
"19","mutant","Group 1: dpy-11(e207), trx-1(ok1449), trx-4(ok3519), and pdi1(gk271) mutants were significantly more resistant to sulfide than N2 worms (Fig. "
"20","mutant","These mutants all contain a loss-of-function mutation in a gene coding for a thioredoxin or a thioredoxin-related protein L. "
"21","mutant","Notably, not all of the thioredoxin family mutants displayed tolerance to sulfide (e.g. the trx-2(ok1526), png-1(ok1654) and F35G2.1(ok1669) strains) and the resistance among the surviving mutants was variable, suggesting that functional differences, including expression pattern, subcellular localization, and affinity to sulfide, may play a significant role in determining the function of a particular thioredoxin family protein in a sulfide rich environment. "
"22","mutant","Group 2: The egl-9(n571), vhl-1(ok161), and rhy-1(ok1402)mutants showed significantly greater tolerance to sulfide than N2 controls (Fig. "
"23","mutant","This conclusion is further supported by the results of a previous study [25] that showed that egl-9 and vhl-1 mutants have increased tolerance toward H2S, and that this tolerance is HIF-1-dependent. "
"24","mutant","Group 3: The mitochondrial mutants isp-1(q150), nuo-6(qm200), tpk-1(qm162), and gro-1(ok942), and the telomere length regulator mutant clk-2(qm37) were significantly more resistant to sulfide than N2 control (Fig. "
"25","mutant","Interestingly, these mutants have an extended lifespan under normal growth conditions [26–28]. "
"26","mutant","However, other longed-lived mutants, such as eat-2(ad465), pmk-1(km25), and the mitochondrial mutant clk-1(e2519), were not protected against sulfide toxicity (Fig. "
"27","mutant","Groups 4–8: None of the mutants in these groups showed a significant difference in survival compared to N2 worms (Supplemental Fig. "
"28","mutant","Identification of sulfide resistant mutants. "
"29","mutant","Box and whisker plot comparing the survival of N2 worms and mutants involved in (A) Redox regulation (B) O2-responses, and (C) Lifespan regulation. "
"30","mutant","Expression of the intact dpy-11 gene, dpy-11(wt), in dpy-11 mutants completely restored the wild-type morphology to these animals (Fig. "
"31","mutant","Transgenic dpy-11(e207) mutants expressing the dpy-11(wt) construct displayed poor survival after exposure to sulfide (similar to N2). "
"32","mutant","By contrast, dpy-11(e207) mutants expressing either the dpy-11(C54S) or the dpy-11(C51S/C54S) constructs showed high survival, suggesting that sulfide toxicity is mediated by the activity of the catalytic cysteine in DPY-11. "
"33","mutant","To explore this, we tested the sulfide tolerance of eight additional dpy mutants (Fig. "
"34","mutant","The dpy-7(e88) and dpy-8(sc44) collagen mutants showed a significant increase in survival compared to N2 worms. "
"35","mutant","By contrast, dpy-1(e1), dpy-4(e1166), dpy-5(e61), dpy6(e14), dpy-13(e184), and dpy-17(e164) mutants had a similar mortality rate to N2 controls, indicating that not all dpy mutants have high tolerance to sulfide. "
"36","mutant","For example, the dpy-1(e1), dpy-5(e61), dpy-6(e14), and dpy-11(e207)mutants are all strong dpys [30] with decreased speed (see Supplemental Fig. "
"37","mutant","Moreover, dpy-7(e88) mutants are less dumpy than dpy5(e61) and dpy-6(e14) (Supplemental Fig. "
"38","mutant","To demonstrate that the resistance of dpy7(e88) mutants to sulfide is solely dependent on dpy-7 function, we expressed a polycistronic construct of dpy-7(wt) and mCherry under dpy-7 promoter in dpy-7(e88) mutants. "
"39","mutant","Expression of dpy-7(wt) in dpy-7(e88) mutants restored their sensitivity to sulfide to the level seen in N2 controls (Fig. "
"40","mutant","Notably, a recent study by Blackwell and colleagues showed that some C. elegans collagens are essential for the extended lifespan of daf-2 mutants [33], suggesting that ECM structure regulates lifespan. "
"41","mutant","Like dpy-11(e207) mutants, trx-1(ok1449) mutants showed resistance to sulfide (Fig. "
"42","mutant","Therefore, we hypothesized that the expression of trx-1(wt) in trx-1 mutants would restore the sensitivity to sulfide. "
"43","mutant","Restoring the function of trx-1 to trx-1 mutants significantly decreased their survival in sulfide (Fig. "
"44","mutant","Since trx-1 is also expressed in the ASJ neurons [35,36], we asked whether the expression of trx-1 in the intestine alone would inhibit the resistance of trx-1(ok1449) mutants to sulfide. "
"45","mutant","The expression of trx-1 in the intestine decreased the survival of trx-1(ok1449) mutants to the level seen in N2 worms (Fig. "
"46","mutant","To explore their possible function in sulfide toxicity, we measured the resistance of three glutaredoxin mutants and four glutaredoxin RNAis (Supplemental Fig. "
"47","mutant","None of the glutaredoxin mutants/RNAis affected the resistance of worms to sulfide. "
"48","mutant","The survival of worms covered with the 10% lead acetate plates was significantly higher than N2 controls, and resembled the survival of egl-9(n571) mutants (Supplemental Fig. "

"50","mutant","(B) Box and whisker plot comparing the survival of N2 worms, dpy-11(e207) mutants, and dpy-11(e207) transgenic worms in sulfide. "

"53","mutant","(G) Box and whisker plot comparing the survival of N2 worms, trx-1(ok1449) mutants, and trx-1(ok1449) transgenic worms in sulfide. "
"54","mutant","To explore whether the decrease in ATP level is correlated with the survival of worms in sulfide, we measured the level of ATP in five mutants with high tolerance to sulfide and in hif-1(ia4) mutants that have low tolerance to sulfide (Supplemental Fig. "
"55","mutant","The levels of ATP remained relatively unchanged in both egl-9(n571) and isp-1(qm150) mutants (Supplemental Fig. "
"56","mutant","By contrast, the levels of ATP were significantly decreased in trx-1(ok1449), dpy-7(e88), and nuo-6(qm200) mutants (Supplemental Fig. "
"57","mutant","Surprisingly, the levels of ATP were not significantly changed in hif-1(ia4) mutants (Supplemental Fig. "
"58","mutant","Since sulfide induces UPRmt and some mitochondrial mutants are resistant to sulfide (Fig. "
"59","mutant","(G) Survival curves of N2 worms and mutants in 200 mM paraquat (PQ). "
"60","mutant","(H) Survival of N2 worms, hif-1(ia4) mutants, and sulfideresistant mutants with either N2 or hif-1(ia4) genetic background (box and whisker plot). "
"61","mutant","Asterisks indicate significance for comparisons with hif-1(ia4) mutants. "
"62","mutant","If so, sulfide-resistant mutants should be protected against paraquat toxicity. "
"63","mutant","To test this hypothesis, we exposed the sulfide-resistant mutants nuo6(qm200), isp-1(qm150), trx-4(ok3519), and dpy-7(e88) to 200 mM paraquat and measured their survival over 24 h. "
"64","mutant","All sulfide-resistant mutants survived longer in paraquat than did the N2 controls (Fig. "
"65","mutant","2C, respectively), while providing significantly less protection from paraquat than these mutants (p<0.0001, log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test). "
"66","mutant","To explore whether the sulfidetolerance of these mutants is mediated by HIF-1, we introduced the deletion mutation hif-1(ia4) into dpy-7(e88), dpy-11(e207), isp1(qm150), trx-1(ok1449), and trx-4(ok3519) mutants, and measured the survival of the double mutants in sulfide. "
"67","mutant","The survival of all hif1(ia4) double mutants were similar to hif-1(ia4) mutants (Fig. "
"68","mutant","It is tempting to hypothesize that the common denominator of sulfide resistant mutants affecting thioredoxin family genes, mitochondrial genes, and collagen genes is that they activate defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. "
"69","mutant","Intriguingly, we show that sulfide resistance mutants are also more resistant to paraquat (Fig. "

"72","model","A model of this pathway suggests that initially sulfide is oxidized by sulfide quinone reductase (SQR). "
"73","model","A possible caveat to this model is that previous studies showed that 0.3 mM sulfide decreases the function of SQR [10], suggesting that perhaps other enzymes may be involved in sulfide detoxification in the colon. "
