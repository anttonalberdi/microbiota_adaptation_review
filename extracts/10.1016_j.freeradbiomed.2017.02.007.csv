"1","wild","Finally, we show that sulfide resistance varies among wild C. elegans and other nematode species, suggesting that tolerance to sulfide was naturally selected in certain habitats. "
"2","wild","In the wild, C. elegans is found in rotting fruits and compost heaps, where it is surrounded by various bacteria. "
"3","wild","In addition, we expressed the wild-type genomic region of dpy-11 as control (dpy-11(wt)). "
"4","wild","Expression of the intact dpy-11 gene, dpy-11(wt), in dpy-11 mutants completely restored the wild-type morphology to these animals (Fig. "
"5","wild","Notably, the expression pattern of these constructs was similar to the wild-type construct. "
"6","wild","(A) Expression pattern of dpy-11 wild-type and mutant construct driven by dpy-11 promoter. "
"7","wild","The resistance against sulfide toxicity is naturally varied in nematodes Since nematodes may encounter conditions of high sulfide in their natural habitat [18,65], we next explored the natural resistance of wild C. elegans isolates and other nematode species to sulfide. "
"8","wild","To explore whether wild C. elegans isolates and other free-living nematodes are naturally resistant to sulfide, we measured the survival of ten C. elegans strains (and N2 worms, as controls) and five non-C. elegans nematode species in sulfide. "
"9","wild","Four out of ten wild C. elegans strains showed significant resistance to sulfide compared to N2 controls (Fig. "
"10","wild","6A), indicating that resistance to sulfide varies among wild C. elegans isolates. "
"11","wild","(A) Quantification of the survival of N2 worms, wild C. elegans strains (in blue), and non-C. elegans nematode strains (in red). "
"12","wild","Our studies reveal fascinating natural variation in the tolerance to sulfide among wild C. elegans isolates (Fig. "

"15","adaptation","This unusual combination may have arisen as an adaptation to catalase inhibition by sulfide. "
