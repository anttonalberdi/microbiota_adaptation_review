"1","wild","Upon cold exposure as well as after high-fat diet feeding (diet-induced obesity or DIO model), these knockout (KO) mice developed less subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) as compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (reduction was more pronounced in ADAMTS5-P mice). "
"2","wild","ADAMTS5 wild-type (WT or Adamts5+/+) and homozygous deficient (Adamts5-/-) littermate mice were generated from heterozygous breeding pairs and genotyped as described [13, 15] (http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.j9wcr7e; http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io. kaucsew). "
