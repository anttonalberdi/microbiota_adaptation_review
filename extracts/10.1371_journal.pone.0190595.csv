"13","adaptat","Prior to actual measurements, mice were adapted in regular filter-top cages for 7 days to single housing and specific drinking nipples, followed by a 48 h adaptation period in the Calocages. "
"14","inbred","Also, modifier genes (i.e. inherited genetic variations leading to qualitative and quantitative differences in disease phenotype) may be variably expressed in different inbred mouse strains [24, 25]. "
"15","model","Upon cold exposure as well as after high-fat diet feeding (diet-induced obesity or DIO model), these knockout (KO) mice developed less subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) as compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (reduction was more pronounced in ADAMTS5-P mice). "
"16","model","Enhanced browning of WAT, as monitored by expression of UCP-1 was seen in the ADAMTS5-J KO mice upon cold exposure but not in the DIO model (seen in both conditions with the ADAMTS5-P mice). "
"17","model","Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass was not different between KO and WT ADAMTS5-J mice, either upon cold exposure or in the DIO model (in contrast to the enhanced BAT mass with the ADAMTS5-P mice). "
"18","model","Insulin sensitivity was improved in the ADAMTS5-J KO mice, and they were protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the DIO model (as the ADAMTS5-P mice). "
"19","model","Materials and methods Animals and experimental models Heterozygous ADAMTS5-P mice [13] were a kind gift from Prof J. "
"20","model","For the diet-induced obesity (DIO) model, eight-week-old male mice had ad libitum access to drinking water and were kept on standard chow (SFD, 10.9 kJ/g) or on western high-fat diet (HFD; 22 kJ/g; kcal from 42% fat, 43% from carbohydrates and 15% from protein; E15721-34, Ssniff, Soest, Germany) for 15 weeks (http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.kbacsie).

"
"23","model","Comparison of the phenotype of the Adamts5-/--J mice of the present study with that of the Adamts5-/--P mice reveals some similarities supporting specificity of the phenotype, but also some quantitative and qualitative differences: (i) with respect to WAT mass: in Adamts5-/--J mice lower sWAT and GON fat mass was found, which was significant after 2 weeks of cold exposure, but only showed a trend in the DIO model; (ii) with respect to BAT mass: in Adamts5-/--J mice no significant difference with WT mice was observed after 2 weeks of cold exposure nor in the DIO model; (iii) with respect to browning of WAT: in Adamts5-/--J mice higher expression of UCP-1 mRNA and protein was found after 2 weeks of cold exposure (mRNA: 1.5to 2-fold as compared to 5-fold for Adamts5-/--P mice). "
"24","model","However, in the DIO model UCP-1 or Cidea expression levels in sWAT were not different between WT and Adamts5-/-J mice (as compared to 30-fold enhancement for Ucp1 or 5-fold for Cidea for Adamts5-/--P versus WT) [12]. "
"25","model","In addition, (iv) with respect to insulin sensitivity: for Adamts5-/--J mice a 50% lower HOMA-IR was found in the DIO model as compared to WT mice, as also seen in the Adamts5-/--P mice (which was confirmed by insulin tolerance tests) [14], and (v) with respect to NASH: Adamts5-/--J mice had lower liver weight and hepatic triglyceride content and developed less steatosis or fibrosis, as shown by histological stainings Fig 6. "
"26","model","Browning of WAT is observed in both strains upon cold exposure, but only for the ADAMTS5-/--P strain in the DIO model (less stringent condition). "
"27","model","A non-proteolytic role of ADAMTS5 has also been proposed to explain its anti-chondrogenic and pro-fibrotic effects in murine models of wound repair [16]. "
"28","knockout","Upon cold exposure as well as after high-fat diet feeding (diet-induced obesity or DIO model), these knockout (KO) mice developed less subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) as compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (reduction was more pronounced in ADAMTS5-P mice). "
"29","knockout","ADAMTS5 deficient or knockout (Adamts5-/or KO) mice [13] indeed showed lower WAT mass, higher mass of interscapular BAT and enhanced browning of WAT, as indicated by elevated UCP-1 levels. "
"30","disease","Introduction Increasing energy expenditure by stimulating thermogenesis through activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and/or induction of browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) is considered a promising strategy to treat/prevent obesity and related metabolic diseases [1–3]. "
"31","disease","This is in accordance with the disease severity distribution (Fig 7C). "
"32","disease","Also, modifier genes (i.e. inherited genetic variations leading to qualitative and quantitative differences in disease phenotype) may be variably expressed in different inbred mouse strains [24, 25]. "
"33","disease","Design and validation of a histological scoring system for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. "
