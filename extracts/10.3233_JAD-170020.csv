"
"6","model","Recently, it was reported that pro-96 longed shifts in gut microbial species composition97 and diversity induced by a long-term broad-spectrum98 combinatorial antibiotic treatment regime attenuated 99 cerebral A plaque deposition in the APPswe/PS1E9 100 mouse model of AD [19]. "
"7","model","How106 ever, the alteration of gut microbial composition and 107 diversity has not yet been confirmed in AD patients 108 or in AD model mice. "
"8","model","Thus, we compared the fecal 109 microbiome of an AD male mice model and littermate 110 controls at different ages under specific pathogen-free 111 (SPF) conditions, thus excluding the possible influ112 ences of factors such as diet, weight, gender, cage 113 illumination, living habit, and medications. "
"9","model","Additionally, to demonstrate whether 218 the variations of gut microbiota were associated with 219 age or AD model status, we performed Pearson’s cor220 relation analysis based on the microbial community 221 difference matrix using R Studio software. "
"10","model","The color bar (log scale) indicates the range of the relative abundance of the genus in groups at the top right, and it is proportional to the abundance of certain taxon.

"12","model","In addition, we449 observed the correlation between gut microbiota and450 AD model status (Pearson’s R = 0.2325, p = 0.0037)451 (Supplementary Table 3).452 The functional analysis predicted more than 30453 metabolic and cellular pathways to be altered in454 AD mice. "
"13","model","495 DISCUSSION 496 The present study compared the fecal micro497 biome and SCFAs of WT and AD model mice at 498 different ages. "
"14","model","530 While human studies provide clinically relevant 531 insight, mouse models are (due to their potential con532 trollability), valuable for researching the association 533 between gut microbiome and host health or disease. "
"15","model","534 Thus, we use the most widely-used mouse AD model 535 to characterize alterations of gut microbiota in AD 536 mice reared under controlled conditions. "

"17","model","Notably,546 Verrucomicrobia was dramatically increased at the547 older mouse group, especially in the AD model548 transgenic mice. "
"18","model","This elevated675 metabolism is apt to decrease cerebral butyrate lev-676 els, which may be a factor compromising cognition677 in AD.678 Recently, Brandscheid et al. [69] analyzed the679 whole bacterial phyla and other four bacteria (Akker-680 mansia muciniphila, the genus Bifidobacterium,681 Escherichia coli, and the Clostridium leptum group)682 by PCR amplification in another AD model, namely683 5xFAD mice. "
"19","model","They found no difference between684 5xFAD and WT mice in populations of several bac-685 teria, i.e., the Bifidobacterium and Escherichia coli.686 On the other hand, they did observe other changes687 at the age of nine weeks of age; the amount of688 Firmicutes and the Clostridium leptum group was689 increased in the 5xFAD model mice while Bac-690 teroidetes were decreased in comparison to the WT691 littermates. "
"20","model","It is beyond 700 dispute that the gut microbiota is inherently diverse, 701 and its composition changes due to various fac702 tors, including, but not limited to the specific AD 703 model, experimental method, breeding environment, 704 even regional differences. "
"21","model","As such, it is important to 705 identify general principles relating gut flora to AD 706 models. "
