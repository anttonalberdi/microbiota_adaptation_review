"1","wild","Emails: gu_02788@163.com and djj@imbcams.com.cn Funding information National Sci-Tech key project, Grant/ Award Number: 2017ZX10103010; Yunnan Science and Technology Talent and Platform Program, Grant/Award Number: 2017HC019 Abstract Larus ridibundus, a migratory wild bird, has become one of the most popular gull species in southwest China in recent years. "
"2","wild","There has been no information on the gut microbiota and intestinal pathogenic bacteria configuration in wild L. ridibundus, even though the public are in close contact with this bird. "
"3","wild","Each year, many visitors come to watch and feed them on city lakes or rivers; and thus the public are in close contact with this wild bird. "
"4","wild","Several studies on gut metagenomic analysis have been conducted on some domestic bird species (Waite & Taylor, 2014); and some referred to wild birds (Dewar, Arnould, Krause, Dann, & Smith, 2014; Dewar et al., 2013). "
"5","wild","So far, there has been no information on the gut microbiota and intestinal pathogenic bacteria configuration in migrated wild L. ridibundus. "
"6","wild","F IGURE  4 The intestinal bacteria isolation and PFGE clustering results for important pathogenic isolates in this study. (a) The composition of intestinal bacteria isolation. (b) Dendrogram for PFGE patterns of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. (c) Dendrogram for PFGE patterns of Salmonella. (d) Dendrogram for PFGE patterns of Yersinia enterocolitica      |  7 of 9LIAO et AL. some patients suffering from diarrhea infected by EPEC from our previous study (Zhang, Yang, et al., 2016; Zhang, Zhou, et al., 2016) for comparison purpose, and no similar patterns were found between this wild bird and patients, as Figure 4b shown. "
"7","wild","In our study, Proteobacteria and Tenericutes phylum were the important communities for this wild bird. "
"8","wild","The role of wild birds in transmitting pathogens indicated the importance of avian pollution in zoonosis. "
"9","wild","Typhimurium from L. ridibundus, and indicated this wild bird might play a role in the spread of S. "
"10","wild","These data have paid useful attention on the risks for wild birds to public health. "
"11","wild","Determination of the incidence of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, and Clostridium perfringens in wild birds near broiler chicken houses by sampling intestinal droppings. "
"12","wild","Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in wild European starlings at a Kansas cattle feedlot. "
"13","model","Postprandial remodeling of the gut microbiota in Burmese pythons. "
"14","disease","Casecontrol study of diarrheal disease etiology in individuals over 5 years in southwest China. "
"15","environment","Since their migratory character and feeding behavior (Berg & Anderson, 1972), public maybe concerned on the possibility of waterfowl fecal contamination in environmental waters for the potential spread of microbial pathogens to humans, domesticated animals and human food sources. "
"16","environment","These differences might be due to gull species, living habits, or the environmental factors, while the most important one was different methods to generate the 16S libraries. "
"17","environment","Diversity of Salmonella strains isolated from the aquatic environment as determined by serotyping and amplification of the ribosomal DNA spacer regions. "
"18","human","None of the potentially pathogenic isolates were identical to humanisolated counterparts suggesting that there was little crossinfection between humans and gulls, despite close proximity. "
"19","human","Previous studies showed that gut microbial mutualisms, commensalisms, and pathogen interactions have been considered to be an important factor for human health and animals (Backhed, Ley, Sonnenburg, Peterson, & Gordon, 2005). "
"20","human","Since their migratory character and feeding behavior (Berg & Anderson, 1972), public maybe concerned on the possibility of waterfowl fecal contamination in environmental waters for the potential spread of microbial pathogens to humans, domesticated animals and human food sources. "
"21","human","However, the risks associated with exposure to recreational waters impacted by fresh gull, chicken, or pig faeces appear substantially lower than waters impacted by human sources (Soller, Schoen, Bartrand, Ravenscroft, & Ashbolt, 2010). "
"22","human","In our study, none of the potentially pathogenic isolates were identical to human isolates counterparts suggested that there was little cross infection between human and gulls regardless of the potential close encounters. "
"23","human","It was further suggested that the public health risks of gull fecal pollution (at least this species) were less than human and other animal sources. "
"24","human","Indeed, previous studies have shown that waterfowl feces may carry human pathogens such as Campylobacter spp. "
"25","human","Hostbacterial mutualism in the human intestine. "

"28","human","Estimated human health risks from exposure to recreational waters impacted by human and nonhuman sources of faecal contamination. "
"29","laboratory","The amplicons were normalized, pooled, and sequencing was conducted in our laboratory (Kunming, China) using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, USA). "
