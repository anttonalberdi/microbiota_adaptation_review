"","Keyword","Context"
"1","wild","The results showed that DSS-induced colitis was aggravated in C6deficient mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, as represented by the markedly greater weight loss, higher disease activity index (DAI), shortened colon length, more severe histological injury with increased epithelial ulcerations, and massively increased infiltration of leukocytes accompanied by much higher myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in local inflammatory colonic sites. "
"2","wild","We found that murine acute DSS-induced coliis was aggravated in C6-deficient mice compared with wild-type WT) mice, indicating the protective role of MAC in IBD. . "
"3","model","Here, we used C6-deficient mice in which MAC formation was blocked due to the absence of C6 to develop an acute colitis model by the administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). "
"4","model","Recently, more studes in rodent models of colitis have suggested a pathogenic role f complement. "
"5","model","C5aR(CD88)-deficient ice have been reported to show milder disease symptoms in the cute model of DSS-induced colitis (Johswich et al., 2009), in line ith the protective effect of C5aR(CD88) antagonists in rat models nduced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) (Woodruff t al., 2003, 2005) and murine models of DSS-induced colitis (Jain t al., 2013). "
"6","model","Complement is activated in acute DSS-induced colitis Among the colitis animal models, DSS-induced colitis has been idely used to mimic IBD. "
"7","model","In addition, the roles of different complement comonents in experimental colitis models are also controversial. "
"8","model","Role of the C5a receptor (C5aR) in acute and chronic dextran sulfate-induced models of inflammatory bowel disease. "
"9","model","The role of the complement and contact systems in the dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis model: the effect of C1 inhibitor in inflammatory bowel disease. "
"10","model","Complement-dependent injury and protection in a murine model of acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. "
"11","model","A potent human C5a receptor antagonist protects against disease pathology in a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease. "
"12","model","Increased potency of a novel complement factor 5a receptor antagonist in a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease. "
"13","knockout","Balancing role of nitric oxide in complement-mediated activation of platelets from mCd59a and mCd59b double-knockout mice. "
