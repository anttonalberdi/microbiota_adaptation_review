"1","wild","Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was introduced into germ-free wild-type, immunodeficient Rag1/, or Rag1/ mice harboring IgA-producing hybridoma cells. "
"2","wild","However, when immunodeficient Rag1/ or SCID mice, which lack a functional adaptive immune system, are colonized with single or multiple species of bacteria, they display a more robust innate immune response than their immunocompetent wild-type counterparts (Keilbaugh et al., 2005; Cash et al., 2006).

"5","wild","We waited 10 days before colonizing these backpack animals with wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron: this decision was based on an analysis of the time course of rise of serum 225.4 mAb levels in Rag1/ backpack controls (Figure S3A). "
"6","wild","Colony-forming unit (CFU) and ELISA assays of cecal contents, harvested from gnotobiotic Rag1/ mice with and without backpacks 10 days after cocolonization with equivalent numbers of the isogenic wild-type and DCPS4 mutant strains, established that, in the absence of any 225.4 antibody, the representation of the mutant in this habitat was 100to 1000-fold lower than wild-type (Figures 3A–3C). "
"7","wild","The basis of the fitness defect produced by DCPS4 remains unknown.Cell HostThe ratio of wild-type to isogenic DCPS4 mutant cells was shifted by an order of magnitude in favor of the mutant in mice with high levels of cecal 225.4 antibody, reflecting a reduction in the dominance of the wild-type bacterium (the representation of the wild-type strain decreased from 99.9% to 99% of the population; Figure 3C). "
"8","wild","In mice with <5 mg (0.4–2.3 mg) of 225.4 antibody per ml of cecal contents, B. thetaiotaomicron 225.4 epitope expression was still significantly reduced compared to Rag1/ animals without backpacks (Figure 3D), but bacterial fitness was not detectably reduced as judged by the ratio of wild-type to DCPS4 mutant CFUs in their ceca (Figure 3C).

"
"17","wild","Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a prototypic member of the host’s oxidative response pathway, and nitric oxide is an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response (Davidson et al., 2004). qRT-PCR assays of RNA prepared from the distal small intestines of mice belonging to the three different groups established that iNOS expression was, on average, 5fold higher in Rag1/mice without backpacks compared to Rag1/mice with backpacks, and 23-fold higher compared to wild-type B6 animals (p < 0.01; Figure 4B).

"
"32","wild","Genes upor downregulated in Rag1/ mice with backpack hybridomas or wildtype B6 animals (E) relative to Rag1/ mice without backpacks (B) were identified using the following criteria: (1) E/B > 1.2; (2) called ‘‘present’’ in at least two of three ‘‘E’’ GeneChips; and (3) E = B p < 0.05. "
"33","wild","Transcript levels within samples were normalized to ribosomal protein L32 mRNA (50-CCTCTGGTGAAGCCCAA GATC; 50-TCTGGGTTTCCGCCAGTTT), and fold changes were determined for each colonized mouse referenced against the lowest value within the set (a wild-type B6 mouse) (DDCT method) (Sonnenburg et al., 2006; Stappenbeck et al., 2002).
