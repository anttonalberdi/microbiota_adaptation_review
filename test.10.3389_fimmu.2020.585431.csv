The intestinal microbiota is a critical component of mucosal health as evidenced by the
fact that alterations in the taxonomic composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota are
associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. To better understand how the progression
of inflammation impacts the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, we used
culture independent taxonomic profiling to identify temporal changes in the cecal
microbiota of C3Bir IL-10-/- mice concomitantly with the onset and progression of
colitis. This analysis revealed that IL-10-/- mice displayed a biphasic progression in
disease severity, as evidenced by histopathological scores and cytokine production.
Beginning at 4 weeks of age, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-6, G-
CSF, and IL-1a as well as chemokines including RANTES and MIP-1a were elevated in
the serum of IL-10-/- mice. By 19 weeks of age, the mice developed clinical signs of
disease as evidenced by weight loss, which was accompanied by a significant increase in
serum levels of KC and IL-17. While the overall diversity of the microbiota of both wild type
and IL-10-/- were similar in young mice, the latter failed to increase in complexity as the
mice matured and experienced changes in abundance of specific bacterial taxa that are
associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans. Collectively, these results reveal
that there is a critical time in young mice between four to six weeks of age when
inflammation and the associated immune responses adversely affect maturation of
the microbiota.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),
are chronic immunologically-mediated disorders affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The
current hypothesis for the pathogenesis of IBD involves a complex interplay between the mucosal
immune system, environmental factors and the intestinal microbiota in a genetically susceptibleorg February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 5854311
Overstreet et al. Microbiota Dynamics in IL-10-/- Micehost (1–4). The role that enteric bacteria play in the initiation,
progression, and maintenance of the GI inflammatory process
represents a particularly active area of investigation. Studies using
rodent models as well as characterization of IBD patients, strongly
implicate the gut microbiota as having a significant impact on the
pathogenesis of colitis (5–8). For example, it has been observed
that inflammatory bowel diseases correlate with dysbiosis (i.e.,
reduced diversity/complexity of the microbiota) (9–13). There is
evidence of demonstrable changes in the abundance of specific
bacterial taxa associated with IBD including an increase in
Proteobacteria in humans, mice, and companion animals (14–
18). In addition, a decrease in Clostridium cluster groups IV and
XIVa have been noted in patients with active IBD (9, 13, 19, 20).
These Clostridium cluster groups comprise a large proportion of
the gut microbiota in healthy individuals and are known
producers of short chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, which
serve as an important energy source for colonocytes as well as
regulatory molecules for regulatory T-cells (21, 22). Although it is
well established that microbial-derived products activate both
innate and adaptive immune cells and contribute to intestinal
inflammation (23–26), a key question remains as to what extent
the inflammation associated with IBD directly causes changes in
the abundance of specific taxa.
To better understand the relationship between the host
microbiota and immune system responses, we chose to
use interleukin-10 deficient (IL-10-/-) mice to assess the
development of GI inflammation and changes in the resident
microbiota over time (i.e., 4 to 19 weeks of age) (27, 28).
IL-10 is a key cytokine that facilitates immune regulation
(29) and consequently IL-10-/- mice develop spontaneous
enterocolitis associated with the lack of regulatory T cells. The
manifestation of disease can vary in severity depending on the
composition of the intestinal microbiota and the genetic
background of the mice (27, 30). The importance of mouse
strain and the microbial composition to the development of
colitis in IL-10-/- mice was elegantly studied by Hart at al. In their
study they transferred embryos into surrogate dams from various
vendors and then examined the resulting offspring for
inflammation (31). Compared to IL-10-/- mice reared under
conventional housing conditions, mice maintained under
specific-pathogen free (SPF) conditions (i.e., absence of
Helicobacter species) have attenuated disease while germ-free
IL-10-/- animals fail to develop disease (32–34). A study by
Whary et al. revealed that at least two bacterial species
(Lactobacillus reuteri and Helicobacter hepaticus) needed to be
present in the GI microbiota before inflammation could develop
(35). Mice on a C3H/HeJBir background are highly susceptible to
disease compared to other IL-10-/- strains such as C57BL/6J
which are resistant to the development of colitis (4, 30). This is in
part because the parental strain (C3H/HeJBir) is prone to
spontaneous colitis due to the presence of the major colitis
susceptibility locus (Cdcs1) on chromosome 3 (3, 36, 37).
While IL-10-/- mouse models have been used to correlate
differences in bacterial taxa present with the severity of
inflammation (38–41), we reasoned that additional insights
into the disease process can be gained from a longitudinalFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2study that describe the dynamic changes in the microbiota over
multiple time points as inflammation progresses (11, 42). To
address this unknown, we used C3Bir.129P2(B6)-Il10tm1Cgn/Lt
(C3Bir IL-10-/-) mice as a genetic model of gastrointestinal
inflammation (28, 30, 43–45).
The cecal microbiota of IL-10-/- mice, along with that of C3H/
HeJ control animals, were characterized by 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequencing along with histological observations and
measurements of serological biomarkers of inflammation to
assess changes in the microbial composition and concurrent
host responses between 4 and 19 weeks of age. The histological
and inflammatory biomarker data indicated that mucosal
inflammation in C3Bir IL-10-/- mice was moderate to severe as
early as 4 weeks of age. Over the course of the 15-week study, an
increase in the Shannon diversity index and the number of
observed bacterial species was seen only in WT mice. Specific
bacterial taxa were altered in abundance in the IL-10-/- mice,
including a reduction in bacteria generally regarded as beneficial
to the host such as members of the Clostridium cluster group
XIVa, which is reduced in patients with IBD (13, 46). An increase
in Enterobacteriaceae was also observed, reaching 8% of the total
cecal bacterial community at 19 weeks, compared to less than
0.5% in WT mice. We also observed greater variability in the
microbial composition throughout the study in the IL-10-/- mice,
which is consistent with recent observations in human IBD
patients (11). We also used the metagenome prediction
software, PICRUSt, to look at differences between the two
communities (47). The results from our analysis revealed that
the IL-10-/- community had a greater number of predicted
functions than the WT community post 4 weeks of age. These
results build upon prior work evaluating the C3Bir IL-10-/-
mouse model and reveals a strong correlation between levels of
inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and chemokines) and
the failure to develop a diverse and rich microbial community
that otherwise occurs in wildtype mice (4, 38, 39).MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Four-week-old female homozygous IL-10-/- mice on a C3H/
HeJBir background (C3Bir.129P2(B6)-Il10tm1Cgn/Lt) and C3H/
HeJ controls were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, ME) in two separate shipments. The C3Bir IL-10-/-
mice were positive for both H. hepaticus and Helicobacter
muridarum. As the mice from different litters were mixed with
the shipping container, they were then randomly placed into
cages with a maximum of five mice per cage. At Iowa State
University, animals were housed under SPF conditions in
Innocage® IVC cages supported by an Innovive IVC rack (San
Diego CA). All mice were maintained in the same room (12:12 h
dark/light cycle) and there were no other mice housed within this
room. Mice were allowed ad libitum access to 2019S diet from
Envigo (Madison, WI) and the drinking water was acidified (pH
2.8-3.2). All provisions (food, water, bedding) were autoclaved
prior to use. Body weights were measured three times per weekFebruary 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 585431
Overstreet et al. Microbiota Dynamics in IL-10-/- Miceduring the experiment. The mice were all routinely monitored
for appearance of any clinical signs of disease (e.g., weight loss,
diarrhea, rectal bleeding). All animal procedures were performed
in accordance with the experimental protocol approved by the
Iowa State University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Sample Collection and Preparation
Randomly selected (i.e., from different cages) IL-10-/- mice (n = 5
to 13 per time point) and the C3H/HeJ age-matched cohorts
were necropsied at 4, 7, 10, 12, or 19 weeks of age. At each time
point, mice were collected from a multiple of cages for each
cohort to avoid assessing a cage effect. Blood was collected via
cardiac puncture following euthanasia using CO2 asphyxiation.
For DNA extraction, the cecum was aseptically excised and a
portion of each cecum with contents were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −20°C. The remaining cecal and colonic
tissues from the same mice, devoid of contents, were placed in
10% buffered formalin for histopathologic evaluation.
Macroscopic Assessment of Intestinal
Lesions
Macroscopic lesions of the cecum were scored using the
following parameters: 1) atrophy, 2) enlarged cecal tonsil, 3)
diarrheic luminal contents, 4) presence of fresh blood, 5) gross
thickening (edema) of tissue. Lesion severity scores were based
on the number of gross lesions with a maximum score of 5,
indicative of severe disease. Macroscopic lesions of the colon
were similarly scored using the following parameters: 1) presence
of fresh blood, 2) gross thickening (edema) of tissue, 3) diarrheic
luminal contents. Lesion severity scores were based on the
number of gross lesions with a maximum score of 3, indicative
of severe disease.
Histopathological Assessment
Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for light microscope
evaluation. Stained tissue sections of cecum and colon were
scored in a blinded fashion by a board-certified veterinary
pathologist (JMH), as previously described (48, 49). The final
histological score represented the numerical sum of all five
parameters with each parameter scored from 0–5 (0= no
lesion, 5= maximum severity) with a maximum cumulative
score of 25. Histopathologic parameters evaluated included: 1)
mucosal ulceration, 2) magnitude of lamina propria infiltration
and character of inflammatory cells, 3) mucosal edema, 4)
stromal collapse, 5) crypt hyperplasia.
Serum Cytokine/Chemokine Quantification
At necropsy, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and
allowed to clot for 24 h at 4°C. Serum was harvested following
centrifugation of the blood for 10 min at 10,000 x g and was then
stored at −20°C until analyzed. Measurements of cytokine and
chemokine concentrations were performed using a murine
multiplexed antibody array according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The mean fluorescentFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3intensity (MFI) values were converted to analyte concentrations
using known standards and commercial software (xPONET®).
Serum Amyloid A (SAA) Quantification
The concentration of the acute phase protein, serum amyloid A
(SAA), in the serum was measured using a commercial ELISA kit
(Tridelta Development, Ireland) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After completion of the reaction, the absorbance
was measured at 450 nm (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices).
The concentration of SAA in the serum was calculated based on
known concentrations of SAA standards, which were evaluated
on the same plate as the samples. All reactions were performed
in duplicate.
DNA Extraction From Tissues and
Contents
Total genomic DNA was extracted from cecal tissues and their
contents using a bead beating and column extraction method
(50). Samples were subjected to homogenization using zirconia
beads (1:3 ratio of 0.5 mm and 0.1 mm beads) with subsequent
heating to 70°C for 15 min. This step was repeated twice. The
DNA was purified using a QIAamp column (Qiagen, Valencia
CA) and concentrations quantified using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington DE).
16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing
Amplicon sequencing was performed by the Research and Testing
Laboratory (Lubbock, TX) using 454 pyrosequencing technology
as previously described with primers forward 28F: GAGTT
TGATCNTGGCTCAG and reverse 519R: GTNTTACN
GCGGCKGCTG (51). Raw sequence data were screened,
trimmed, filtered, denoised, and chimera depleted with default
settings using the QIIME pipeline version 1.5.0 (52) and
UCHIME. FASTA formatted sequences were then clustered into
operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clusters with 96.5% identity
(3.5% divergence) using USEARCH (53). For each cluster, the seed
sequence was placed in a FASTA formatted sequence file. This file
was then queried against a database of high-quality sequences
derived fromNCBI using a distributed.NET algorithm that utilizes
BLASTN+. The BLASTn+ outputs were compiled using a.NET
and C# analysis pipeline. The data reduction analysis was
performed as previously described (51). Data are deposited in
GenBank’s short read with accession number SRP033709.
To account for unequal sequencing depth across samples,
subsequent analysis was performed on a randomly selected
subset of 1,900 sequences per sample. This number was chosen
to avoid exclusion of samples with lower number of sequence
reads from further analysis. Alpha diversity (i.e., rarefaction) and
beta diversity measures were calculated and plotted using QIIME.
Differences in microbial communities between animal groups and
time points were investigated using the phylogeny-based
unweighted Unifrac distance metric. To determine if any groups
of samples contained significantly different bacterial communities,
the analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) function in the statistical
software package PRIMER 6 (PRIMER-E Ltd., Lutton, UK) was
used on the unweighted UniFrac distance matrix (17).February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 585431
Overstreet et al. Microbiota Dynamics in IL-10-/- MicePICRUSt Analysis
The software PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of
Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) (47)
available through the Galaxy workflow framework (54, 55), was
used to make functional gene content predictions based on 16S
rRNA gene data present in the Greengenes database (47). Linear
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) (56) was used to determine
difference in predicted genes and their specific KEGG orthologs at
the various time-points between WT and IL-10-/- mice.
Statistical Analysis
All values were expressed as mean ± SEM. Serum cytokine/
chemokine data and SAA data were normalized by log
transformation. A repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) model was used for the previously mentioned data,
with treatment group, time and their interaction as fixed effects.
The 454 pyrosequencing data were analyzed using a generalized
linear mixed model, with the same fixed effects structure. T-tests
were used to assess the differences between WT and IL-10-/- at
each time point. To test each treatment temporally, an effect
comparison of time by group was used. Tukey’s t-test was used
for multiple pairwise comparisons among time points. Non-
parametric data were evaluated using a Wilcoxon Rank SumsFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4test. PICRUSt was used to predict the functional capabilities of
bacteria based on the 16S rRNA gene data set. LEfSe was utilized
to evaluate differentially abundant bacterial taxa and predicted
function between the animal groups. P-values ≤ 0.05 were
considered significant for all tests. SAS software (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary NC, USA) was used for all statistical calculations.RESULTS
Taxonomic Profiling Showed Altered
Taxonomic Diversity Microbial Diversity in
IL-10-/- Mice Compared to WT Mice
To compare the composition of the GI microbiota between
C3Bir IL-10-/- and WT C3H/HeJ mice, 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequencing was used to identify the predominant
bacterial taxa from cecal contents collected temporally from
separate mice between 4 and 19 weeks of age. As the mice
aged over the 19 weeks, rarefaction analysis of the cecal
microbiota revealed that the number of OTUs increased in the
WTmice (Figure 1A), as well as did the Shannon diversity index
(Figure 1B). In contrast, the beta-diversity of the microbiota did
not change in the IL-10-/- mice over the 19 weeks of the study.A

Overstreet et al. Microbiota Dynamics in IL-10-/- MiceComparison of the taxonomic groups between IL-10-/- and
WT mice revealed differences in abundance of specific phyla.
Members of the Firmicutes were the most abundant in
both groups of mice, although the proportion was consistently
higher in WT C3H/HeJ mice (approximately 90% of the
microbial population) compared to the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice.
Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were found at relatively high
proportional levels in the IL-10-/- mice compared to WT mice
throughout the study (Supplementary Figures 1A, B). Changes
in abundance at the phylum level were minor over the 19 weeks
of the study. In WT mice, Proteobacteria increased between
weeks 4 and 7 (1% to 3%, p=0.05) and then decreased between
weeks 12 and 19 (3% to 0.8%, p=0.03) (Supplementary Figure
1B). At the phylum level, there were no significant changes in the
microbial composition of the IL-10-/- mice throughout the 19
weeks of the study.
To better understand the dynamics of the microbiota, the
relative abundance of the most prevalent genera was tracked
between weeks 4 and 19 (Supplementary Figure 2A). With the
exception of Lactobacillus and Prevotella, the remaining taxa in the
WT mice showed significant increases (p ≤ 0.05) in abundance as
the study progressed (Supplementary Figures 2B, C). By 19 weeks
of age, members of the genus Eubacterium had expanded to
represent 7.74% of the total population while the remaining
genera remained collectively less than 10% of the total microbial
community (Supplementary Figure 2C).
Consistent with the Shannon diversity index, there was no
increase observed in the complexity of the cecal microbiota of the
IL-10-/- mice. In addition, multiple taxa (e.g., Blautia, Burkholderia,
Butyrivibrio, Dorea, Lactococcus, Oscillibacter, Pseudomonas, and
Roseburia) detected at 4 weeks of age decreased in relative
abundance throughout the duration of the study (Supplementary
Figures 2D, E). Of these genera, Lactococcus and Roseburia are
generally considered beneficial to mucosal health. In contrast, there
was a significant increase in Escherichia from 2% to 8% of the total
microbiota (p=0.004) between 12 and 19 weeks of age in the C3Bir
IL-10-/- mice. While the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice were positive for H.
hepaticus and H. muridarum, there was no evidence that there was
an increase in Helicobacter species over the 19 weeks of the study.
Functional Analysis of the Microbiomes of
IL-10-/- and WT Mice
PICRUSt analysis was used to assess the extent to which
differences in microbiota composition influenced predicted
microbial functions over time. At week 4, the microbiota of the
WT C3H/HeJ mice showed only a modest increase in the
number of functional gene categories (GO categories)
compared to the microbiota from the IL-10-/- mice (Figure 2);
however, there were fewer GO categories with LEfSe scores > 2
for the WT mice (Supplementary Table 1). For the duration of
the study, the major functional changes in the WT microbiota
remained relatively constant with only a few functional
categories with LEfSe scores > 2 (Supplementary Table 1A).
With respect to the microbiota of the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice, an
increase in the number of GO term categories was observed after
week 7 weeks of age and these differences between WT and KOFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5mice were largely maintained throughout the duration of the study
(Figure 2). The functional categories whose representation
showed marked changes in the IL-10-/- mice, but not in WT
mice, included metabolism, xenobiotic degradation, signal
processing, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and DNA
repair (Supplementary Table 1B). In the WT mice, the
functional changes encompassed primarily carbohydrate and
amino acid metabolism.
Macroscopic/Microscopic Cecal Lesions
Provide Evidence of Early Onset of
Intestinal Inflammation
To connect the observed differences in the microbiota between
the IL-10-/- and C3H/HeJ mice with changes in mucosal health,
we compared differences in the expression of host inflammatory
responses between the C3H/HeJ mice and the C3Bir IL-10-/-
mice over the course of 19 weeks. While no significant differences
were observed in macroscopic cecal lesions between the C3H/
HeJ and IL-10-/- mice at 4 weeks of age, the IL-10-/- mice had
significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater macroscopic lesion scores (range
0-5) at all subsequent time points (Figure 3A). The observed
typhlocolitis of the IL-10-/- mice was characterized by the
presence of intraluminal blood, tissue thickening, cecal
atrophy, and enlarged lymphoid aggregates (Figure 3B).
Similarly, the colons from the IL-10-/- mice presented with
higher macroscopic lesion scores (range 0–3) at weeks 7, 10,
and 12 compared to C3H/HeJ mice (Figure 3C) that were
characterized by colonic tissue thickening and diarrheic
luminal contents. Colon lengths of IL-10-/- mice were found to
be significantly (p ≤ 0.05) shorter at weeks 7 and 12 (Figure 3D).
In contrast, colons from C3H/HeJ mice displayed no cecal or
colonic macroscopic lesions at any point in the study.
Microscopic examination of both cecal and colonic tissues
revealed statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) levels of inflammation
present in the IL-10-/- mice at all time points compared to the
tissue from C3H/HeJ mice (Figures 4A, B). As shown in Figure
4C, cecal tissue sections from IL-10-/- mice had noticeable
mucosal hyperplasia, mononuclear cell infiltrates in the laminaFIGURE 2 | Summary of PICRUSt analysis. The number of GO terms are

Serum Pro-Inflammatory/Chemotactic
Cytokines and SAA Are Increased in IL-
10-/- Mice Versus WT Mice
To investigate the progression of the systemic inflammatory
response of IL-10-/- mice over time, concentrations of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured in
serum samples as biomarkers of inflammation. At 4 weeks of
age, there were already significant elevation of chemokines and
cytokines (e.g., IP-10, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-12(p70), RANTES, IL-13,
MIP-1a, and GM-CSF) in the serum of the IL-10-/- mice but
these elevated levels did not persist over the course of the
experiment (Figure 5). Over the course of the 19 weeks,
significantly (p ≤ 0.05) elevated concentrations of G-CSF, IL-
1a, IL-6, and TNF-a (Figures 6A–D) were observed in the
serum of the IL-10-/- mice in comparison to C3H/HeJ mice. IFN-
g levels were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) elevated in IL-10-/- mice at
each time point except week 19 (Figure 6E). As an acute phase
protein observed during inflammation, SAA was significantly
increased (p ≤ 0.05) in the serum of IL-10-/- mice compared to
C3H/HeJ mice at all-time points (Figure 6F). KC and IL-17 were
the only two cytokines/chemokines that were elevated at week 4
(during the initial inflammatory surge) and then again at week 19Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7(Figures 7A, B) when severe weight became apparent in the
IL-10-/- mice and the experiment was terminated (Figure 7C).DISCUSSION
Throughout the experiment, the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice presented
with severe, histopathological typhlocolitis. This is consistent
with previous studies using this IL-10-/- mouse model (3, 4).
Unexpectedly, cecal inflammation was already present at 4 weeks
of age and was associated with the increased expression of serum
cytokines/chemokines (IP-10, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-12(p70), RANTES,
IL-13, MIP-1a, GM-CSF) in the IL-10-/- mice. There were also a
subset of cytokines/chemokines that were chronically elevated
throughout the duration of the experiment: G-CSF, IL-1a, IL-6,
TNF-a, and IFN-g. These observations in the presence of serum
cytokines/chemokines emphasizes the dynamic nature of
chronic inflammation and suggests that these different
cytokines may contribute temporally to the initiation,

Overstreet et al. Microbiota Dynamics in IL-10-/- Miceregarding elevated cytokine levels in IL-10-/- mice. A study by
Buchler et al. which also used IL-10-/- mice on a C3Bir
background also showed increased levels of IL-6, IL-17, and
IFN-g (4). Work by Matharu et al. also implicate the secretion of
both IL-17 and IFN-g from dysregulated CD4+ regulatory T cells
(TREG) in their model of IL-10
-/- colitis where the mice were
deficient in both IL-10 and TLR4 (58). These results demonstrate
the importance of an effective TREG cell response in maintaining
mucosal health and highlights the cytoprotective benefits of TLR
signaling. IL-10 and IL-17 were also implicated in the disease
process by Eun et al. In their study, using germfree mice
inoculated with seven bacterial species from an IBD patient,
they examined the degree of inflammation in B6 and 129 IL-10-/-
mice at two separate time points (59). As previously mentioned,
this study also revealed that the severity of inflammation was
greater in the 129 IL-10-/- mice which correlated with the
induction of antigen-specific IFNg and IL-17 at six and 12
weeks post-colonization.
The severity of inflammation that develops in IL-10-/- mice is
dependent on the composition of the intestinal resident
microbiota (60). Using a model of Helicobacter-induced IL-10-/-
mouse of colitis, Yang and colleagues demonstrated that mice
housed within different facilities developed colitis with
characteristically different levels of inflammation. Using a 129/
SvEv IL-10-/- mouse model of colorectal cancer, there is evidence
that the nature of intestinal inflammation elicits changes in the
microbiota (61). Based on the analysis of beta-diversity in the
microbiota, we demonstrated that the dysbiosis observed in the IL-
10-/- mice was associated with a failure to establish a diverse
microbiota as was observed in the C3H/HeJ mice. The microbiota
of both C3H/HeJ and IL-10-/- mice was of comparable complexity
at four weeks of age, which may not have been expected given the
results obtained at later time points. However, after four weeks of
age, the microbiota of the C3H/HeJ mice increased in diversity to
levels never attained by the IL-10-/- mice. As the C3H/HeJ mice
aged, bacteria generally recognized as beneficial, such
Eubacterium, Lactococcus, and Ruminococcus, significantly (p ≤
0.05) increased in abundance and in Shannon diversity. This was
not observed in the IL-10-/- mice and this lack of diversity and
richness is similar to that observed by Maharshak and colleagues
at four weeks following colonization of germfree IL10-/- mice with
a SPF microbiota (39, 42).
At four weeks of age, the presence of elevated levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines was observed in the serum of the IL-10-/-
mice. These observations suggest that there is a critical time
where inflammation appears to interfere with the natural
development or diversification of the microbiota. To our
knowledge, this has not been previously reported. Despite
the general appearance of health between four and 17 weeks of
age, the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice maintained a dysbiotic profile of
their microbiota throughout the study; in other words, the
dysbiosis did not abruptly develop with the onset of marked
weight loss at 19 weeks of age. Consequently, it is likely that
the reduced abundance of key taxa contributed to the chronicity
and severity of colitis. For example, taxonomic characterization
of the microbiota revealed that the IL-10-/- mice experiencedFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9a general decrease in abundance of bacteria regarded as
beneficial (e.g., Blautia, Lactococcus, and Roseburia) while the
abundance of Proteobacteria (e.g., E. coli) increased. Similar
increases in Proteobacteria have been noted in other IL-10-/-
studies as well (39, 42). While the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice were
colonized by H. hepaticus and H. muridarum, there was no
demonstrable increase in Helicobacter species over the 19 weeks
of this study.
The development of the composition of the microbiota over
time was hugely distinct between inflamed vs non-inflamed
gastrointestinal tracts. The rarefaction analysis of observed
species and the Shannon diversity index revealed an ordered
increase in microbial diversity as the C3H/HeJ mice aged. In
contrast, the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice showed only a limited increase
in the diversity of the observed microbial species over time. The
progression of microbial diversity may have been significantly
restricted as a consequence of the elevated levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokine/chemokines seen at four weeks of age.
As mentioned above, similar results were obtained in the study
by Maharshak et al. which colonized germfree WT and IL-10-/-
mice with a SPF microbiota (39). Using fecal pellets as their
source material, they reported a decrease in both microbial
richness and diversity over time in the IL-10-/- mice. In their
WT mice, they reported increased bacterial richness over time
supporting the data in this paper. In contrast, when Redhu et al.
compared the fecal microbiota in IL-10 receptor knockout mice,
they observed no differences in microbial diversity between the
WT and IL-10R-/- mice over time (41).
Identification of specific taxa from 16S rRNA gene sequences
also revealed substantial differences in the richness of the
microbial composition at the phylum and genus levels.
Statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) decreases in several genera in
the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice were observed over the course of the
study. At 4 weeks of age, Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Lactococcus,
Roseburia, and Ruminococcus spp. comprised 46% of the
microbial community in the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice but, by 7
weeks of age, these species represented only 21% of the
microbiota support the impact of chronic inflammation on the
composition of the intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, these
taxa include members of the Lachnospiraceae family that is
part of the Clostridium coccoides cluster (cluster XIVa) group
which have been shown to be beneficial to intestinal health
(7, 62). Reduced microbial diversity has been well documented
both in human and companion animal IBD patients (20, 42, 63).
For example, studies have shown that reduction of species
belonging to the C. coccoides cluster is a common feature in
the microbial communities colonizing the colon of human IBD
patients (7, 62, 64–67). In a study evaluating IBD in twins,
Roseburia spp. were decreased in both the feces and ileal
biopsy samples of patients with ileal CD compared to healthy
controls (13).
In addition to reductions of specific members of the
community, there are increases in certain microbes associated
with IBD as well. In particular, increased abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae has been linked to the pathogenesis of
mucosal inflammation in diverse species including humans,February 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 585431
Overstreet et al. Microbiota Dynamics in IL-10-/- Micerodents, dogs, and cats (17, 63, 68–70). As has been noted in
IBD patients, a significant increase in the abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae was observed in the IL-10-/- mice at 19
weeks of age and as the mice began to develop clinical signs of
disease (i.e., weight loss) which was also accompanied by
increased levels of IL-17 and KC in their serum. In these
current studies, the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice abruptly lost greater
than 10% of their body weight and were removed from the study
for humane reasons (Figure S3). IL-17 is increased in humans
with IBD and has been associated with intestinal inflammation in
several animal models (42, 71, 72). Previous studies using the IL-
10-/- model of colitis have either used denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) for their analysis of microbial
compositional (40, 42) or have only collected fecal pellets for 4
weeks post-colonization of germ-free mice with a SPF microbiota
or at 8 and 10 weeks of age (39). In contrast to the present work,
these previous studies provide limited information regarding the
dynamic changes of the microbial diversity or the inflammatory
responses over time.
Using PICRUSt analysis, these results revealed functional
differences in the microbiota between groups of mice that
corresponded with the difference in environmental conditions
encountered by the cecal microbial communities. C3H/HeJ mice
exhibited fewer marked changes in functional categories over time
compared to age matched IL-10-/- mice suggesting that a more
orderly maturation of the gut microbiota had occurred in the WT
mice. Inspection of functional categories with LEfSe scores > 2
revealed a number of gene functions in IL-10-/- mice that were not
significantly altered in C3H/HeJ mice including DNA
recombination, replication and repair mechanisms (week 7),
signal transduction, cell motility and chemotaxis (week 12), and
biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and xenobiotics degradation
and metabolism (week 19). These differences likely represent
adaptations in the functions of the microbial community in the
C3Bir IL-10-/- mice in response to the chronic gastrointestinal
inflammation and the use of metabolic biomarkers may represent
useful biomarkers to better understand the role of inflammation in
shaping the gut microbiota.
Based on the results of this study, we find that there is a
window of opportunity for microbial progression that is crucial
for the development of a diverse microbiome. Similar studies
have shown this effect in infants given antibiotics (73). A Finnish
study by Korpela et al. revealed that children prescribed
macrolide antibiotics between 2-7 years of age had a reduction
in microbial richness even 24 months after antibiotic exposure
(74). A longitudinal study by Yassour et al. that utilized
metagenomics found that children given antibiotics had less
diverse and less stable microbial communities compared to
untreated children (75). These studies support our conclusion
that if the progression of the microbiota is hindered (through
inflammation or antibiotic usage) the effects are long-term with
regards to the stability and diversity of the microbiome.
In conclusion, this study tracked both inflammation and cecal
microbial composition temporally in C3Bir IL-10-/- mice over
multiple time points using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
Results indicate that the C3Bir IL-10-/- mice had begun to developFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10intestinal inflammation as early as 4 weeks of age when their
microbial diversity was at its greatest. The results obtained in this
study suggests that intervention treatments, such as administration
of prebiotics and/or probiotics, or anti-inflammatory therapies,
may be more effective when administered at a critical time point to
establish or maintain a beneficial microbiota contributing to
improved gut health and clinical outcomes.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
