"Host dietary specialization and neutral assembly shape gut bacterial communities of wild dragonflies","Deb R, Nair A, Agashe D",2019,"Article","10.7717/peerj.8058","Host-associated gut microbiota can have significant impacts on host ecology and evolution and are often host-specific. Multiple factors can contribute to such host-specificity: (1) host dietary specialization passively determining microbial colonization, (2) hosts selecting for specific diet-acquired microbiota, or (3) a combination of both. The latter possibilities indicate a functional association and should produce stable microbiota. We tested these alternatives by analyzing the gut bacterial communities of six species of wild adult dragonfly populations collected across several geographic locations. The bacterial community composition was predominantly explained by sampling location, and only secondarily by host identity. To distinguish the role of host dietary specialization and host-imposed selection, we identified prey in the guts of three dragonfly species. Surprisingly, the dragonfliesconsidered to be generalist predatorsconsumed distinct prey; and the prey diversity was strongly correlated with the gut bacterial profile. Such host dietary specialization and spatial variation in bacterial communities suggested passive rather than selective underlying processes. Indeed, the abundance and distribution of 72% of bacterial taxa were consistent with neutral community assembly; and fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that bacteria only rarely colonized the gut lining. Our results contradict the expectation that host-imposed selection shapes the gut microbiota of most insects, and highlight the importance of joint analyses of diet and gut microbiota of natural host populations. © 2019 Deb et al.","community assembly; geographic variation; gut microbiome; host-microbial interactions; predator; specialist; adult; article; diet; dragonfly; expectation; fluorescence in situ hybridization; geography; host microbe interaction; intestine flora; microbial community; natural host; nonhuman; predator; specialization"
"NOD2 in hepatocytes engages a liver-gut axis to protect against steatosis, fibrosis, and gut dysbiosis during fatty liver disease in mice","Cavallari JF, Pokrajac NT, Zlitni S, Foley KP, Henriksbo BD, Schertzer JD",2020,"Article","10.1152/AJPENDO.00181.2020","Obesity promotes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The intestinal microbiota contributes to NAFLD progression through a gut-to-liver pathway that promotes inflammation and fibrosis. Gut microbiota-derived factors can travel to the liver and activate immune responses in liver resident cells to promote inflammation and NAFLD. Little is known about bacterial sensors or immune responses that can protect against NAFLD. We tested whether the bacterial cell wall sensor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing (NOD)2 protects against diet-induced NAFLD in mice. Whole body deletion of NOD2 exacerbated liver steatosis and fibrosis in mice fed a NAFLD-promoting diet. Mice with a hepatocyte-specific deletion of NOD2 (Nod2-/-HKO) also had higher liver steatosis and fibrosis compared with littermate wild-type mice (WT) fed a NAFLD-promoting diet. Hepatocyte-specific NOD2 deletion altered the composition of the gut microbiome. Nod2-/-HKO mice had increased relative abundance of Clostridiales and lower Erysipelotrichaceae among other changes in cecal bacteria compared with littermate WT mice. Hepatocyte-specific NOD2 deletion altered a transcriptional program of liver inflammation, metabolism, and fibrosis. Nod2-/-HKO mice had higher levels of transcripts involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Nod2-/-HKO mice had higher transcript levels of transforming growth factor-β and collagen isoforms, which coincided with higher levels of liver collagen compared with WT mice. These data show that bacterial cell wall sensing within hepatocytes can engage retrograde cross-talk from the liver to the gut, where liver immunity communicates with the gut to influence the intestinal host-microbe relationship during diet-induced NAFLD, and NOD2 within the hepatocyte confers protection from liver steatosis and fibrosis.

"Bacterial-derived neutrophilic inflammation drives lung remodeling in a mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Richmond BW, Du R-H, Han W, Benjamin JT, Van Der Meer R, Gleaves L, Guo M, McKissack A, Zhang Y, Cheng D-S, Polosukhin VV, Blackwell TS",2018,"Article","10.1165/rcmb.2017-0329OC","Loss of secretory IgA is common in the small airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Using mice that lack secretory IgA in the airways due to genetic deficiency of polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR -/- mice), we investigated the role of neutrophils in driving the fibrotic small airway wall remodeling and emphysema that develops spontaneously in these mice. By flow cytometry, we found an increase in the percentage of neutrophils among CD45 + cells in the lungs, as well as an increase in total neutrophils, in pIgR -/- mice compared with wild-Type controls. This increase in neutrophils in pIgR -/- mice was associated with elastin degradation in the alveolar compartment and around small airways, along with increased collagen deposition in small airway walls. Neutrophil depletion using anti-Ly6G antibodies or treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics inhibited development of both emphysema and small airway remodeling, suggesting that airway bacteria provide the stimulus for deleterious neutrophilic inflammation in this model. Exogenous bacterial challenge using lysates prepared from pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria worsened neutrophilic inflammation and lung remodeling in pIgR -/- mice. This phenotype was abrogated by antiinflammatory therapy with roflumilast. Together, these studies support the concept that disruption of the mucosal immune barrier in small airways contributes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease progression by allowing bacteria to stimulate chronic neutrophilic inflammation, which, in turn, drives progressive airway wall fibrosis and emphysematous changes in the lung parenchyma.

"Characterization of intestinal bacteria in wild and domesticated adult black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon)","Rungrassamee W, Klanchui A, Maibunkaew S, Chaiyapechara S, Jiravanichpaisal P, Karoonuthaisiri N",2014,"Article","10.1371/journal.pone.0091853","The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) is a marine crustacean of economic importance in the world market. To ensure sustainability of the shrimp industry, production capacity and disease outbreak prevention must be improved. Understanding healthy microbial balance inside the shrimp intestine can provide an initial step toward better farming practice and probiotic applications. In this study, we employed a barcode pyrosequencing analysis of V3-4 regions of 16S rRNA genes to examine intestinal bacteria communities in wild-caught and domesticated P. monodon broodstock. Shrimp faeces were removed from intestines prior to further analysis in attempt to identify mucosal bacterial population. Five phyla, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, were found in all shrimp from both wild and domesticated environments. The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was assigned at 97% sequence identity, and our pyrosequencing results identified 18 OTUs commonly found in both groups. Sequences of the shared OTUs were similar to bacteria in three phyla, namely i) Proteobacteria (Vibrio, Photobacterium, Novosphingobium, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas and Undibacterium), ii) Firmicutes (Fusibacter), and iii) Bacteroidetes (Cloacibacterium). The shared bacterial members in P. monodon from two different habitats provide evidence that the internal environments within the host shrimp also exerts selective pressure on bacterial members. Intestinal bacterial profiles were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The sequences from DGGE bands were similar to those of Vibrio and Photobacterium in all shrimp, consistent with pyrosequencing results.

"Seed-derived microbial colonization of wild emmer and domesticated bread wheat (Triticum dicoccoides and t. aestivum) seedlings shows pronounced differences in overall diversity and composition","Özkurt E, Hassani MA, Sesiz U, Künzel S, Dagan T, Özkan H, Stukenbrock EH",2020,"Article","10.1128/mBio.02637-20","The composition of the plant microbiota may be altered by ecological and evolutionary changes in the host population. Seed-associated microbiota, expected to be largely vertically transferred, have the potential to coadapt with their host over gen-erations. Strong directional selection and changes in the genetic composition of plants during domestication and cultivation may have impacted the assembly and transmission of seed-associated microbiota. Nonetheless, the effect of plant speciation and domestication on the composition of these microbes is poorly understood. Here, we have investi-gated the composition of bacteria and fungi associated with the wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) and domesticated bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). We show that vertically transmitted bacteria, but not fungi, of domesticated bread wheat species T. aestivum are less diverse and more inconsistent among individual plants compared to those of the wild emmer wheat species T. dicoccoides. We propagated wheat seeds under sterile conditions to characterize the colonization of seedlings by seed-associated mi-crobes. Hereby, we show markedly different community compositions and diversities of leaf and root colonizers of the domesticated bread wheat compared to the wild emmer wheat. By propagating the wild emmer wheat and domesticated bread wheat in two different soils, we furthermore reveal a small effect of plant genotype on microbiota as-sembly. Our results suggest that domestication and prolonged breeding have impacted the vertically transferred bacteria, but only to a lesser extent have affected the soil-derived microbiota of bread wheat. IMPORTANCE Genetic and physiological changes associated with plant domestication have been studied for many crop species. Still little is known about the impact of domestication on the plant-associated microbiota. In this study, we analyze the seed-associated and soil-derived bacterial and fungal microbiota of domesticated bread wheat and wild emmer wheat. We show a significant difference in the seed-associated, but not soil-derived, bacterial communities of the wheat species. Interest-ingly, we find less pronounced effects on the fungal communities. Overall, this study provides novel insight into the diversity of vertically transmitted microbiota of wheat and thereby contributes to our understanding of wheat as a “metaorganism.” Insight into the wheat microbiota is of fundamental importance for the development of im-proved crops. © 2020 Özkurt et al.","agriculture; microbiota assembly; plant breeding; plant domestication; plant microbiota; seed microbiota; seed-associated microbiome; wheat domestication; wheat microbiota; article; crop; domestication; emmer; fungal community; genotype; microbial colonization; microbial community; microbiome; nonhuman; plant breeding; plant seed; seedling; soil; triticum aestivum; wheat; bacterium; classification; domestication; evolution; fungus; genetic variation; genetics; microbiology; microflora; plant breeding; plant seed; seedling; bacteria; biological evolution; domestication; fungi; genetic variation; genotype; microbiota; plant breeding; seedlings; seeds; triticum"
"Cardif (MAVS) regulates the maturation of NK cells","Haynes LD, Verma S, McDonald B, Wu R, Tacke R, Nowyhed HN, Ekstein J, Feuvrier A, Benedict CA, Hedrick CC",2015,"Article","10.4049/jimmunol.1402060","Cardif, also known as IPS-1, VISA, and MAVS, is an intracellular adaptor protein that functions downstream of the retinoic acid- inducible gene I family of pattern recognition receptors. Cardif is required for the production of type I IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines after retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors recognize intracellular antigenic RNA. Studies have recently shown that Cardif may have other roles in the immune system in addition to its role in viral immunity. In this study, we find that the absence of Cardif alters normal NK cell development and maturation. Cardif-/- mice have a 35% loss of mature CD272 CD11b+ NK cells in the periphery. In addition, Cardif-/- NK cells have altered surface marker expression, lower cytotoxicity, decreased intracellular STAT1 levels, increased apoptosis, and decreased proliferation compared with wild-type NK cells. Mixed chimeric mice revealed that the defective maturation and increased apoptotic rate of peripheral Cardif-/- NK cells is cell intrinsic. However, Cardif-/- mice showed enhanced control of mouse CMV (a DNA β-herpesvirus) by NK cells, commensurate with increased activation and IFN-γ production by these immature NK cell subsets. These results indicate that the skewed differentiation and altered STAT expression of Cardif-/- NK cells can result in their hyperresponsiveness in some settings and support recent findings that Cardif-dependent signaling can regulate aspects of immune cell development and/or function distinct from its well-characterized role in mediating cell-intrinsic defense to RNA viruses.

"Fur seal microbiota are shaped by the social and physical environment, show mother–offspring similarities and are associated with host genetic quality","Grosser S, Sauer J, Paijmans AJ, Caspers BA, Forcada J, Wolf JBW, Hoffman JI",2019,"Article","10.1111/mec.15070","Despite an increasing appreciation of the importance of host–microbe interactions in ecological and evolutionary processes, the factors shaping microbial communities in wild populations remain poorly understood. We therefore exploited a natural experiment provided by two adjacent Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) colonies of high and low social density and combined 16S rRNA metabarcoding with microsatellite profiling of mother–offspring pairs to investigate environmental and genetic influences on skin microbial communities. Seal-associated bacterial communities differed profoundly between the two colonies, despite the host populations themselves being genetically undifferentiated. Consistent with the hypothesis that social stress depresses bacterial diversity, we found that microbial alpha diversity was significantly lower in the high-density colony. Seals from one of the colonies that contained a stream also carried a subset of freshwater-associated bacteria, indicative of an influence of the physical environment. Furthermore, mothers and their offspring shared similar microbial communities, in support of the notion that microbes may facilitate mother–offspring recognition. Finally, a significant negative association was found between bacterial diversity and heterozygosity, a measure of host genetic quality. Our study thus reveals a complex interplay between environmental and host genetic effects, while also providing empirical support for the leash model of host control, which posits that bacterial communities are driven not only by bottom-up species interactions, but also by top-down host regulation. Taken together, our findings have broad implications for understanding host–microbe interactions as well as prokaryotic diversity in general. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","arctocephalus gazella; host control; inbreeding; mother–offspring recognition; pinniped; skin microbiome; "
"Exposure to environmental radionuclides is associated with altered metabolic and immunity pathways in a wild rodent","Kesäniemi J, Jernfors T, Lavrinienko A, Kivisaari K, Kiljunen M, Mappes T, Watts PC",2019,"Article","10.1111/mec.15241","Wildlife inhabiting environments contaminated by radionuclides face putative detrimental effects of exposure to ionizing radiation, with biomarkers such as an increase in DNA damage and/or oxidative stress commonly associated with radiation exposure. To examine the effects of exposure to radiation on gene expression in wildlife, we conducted a de novo RNA sequencing study of liver and spleen tissues from a rodent, the bank vole Myodes glareolus. Bank voles were collected from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), where animals were exposed to elevated levels of radionuclides, and from uncontaminated areas near Kyiv, Ukraine. Counter to expectations, we did not observe a strong DNA damage response in animals exposed to radionuclides, although some signs of oxidative stress were identified. Rather, exposure to environmental radionuclides was associated with upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in the livers – an apparent shift in energy metabolism. Moreover, using stable isotope analysis, we identified that fur from bank voles inhabiting the CEZ had enriched isotope values of nitrogen: such an increase is consistent with increased fatty acid metabolism, but also could arise from a difference in diet or habitat between the CEZ and elsewhere. In livers and spleens, voles inhabiting the CEZ were characterized by immunosuppression, such as impaired antigen processing, and activation of leucocytes involved in inflammatory responses. In conclusion, exposure to low dose environmental radiation impacts pathways associated with immunity and lipid metabolism, potentially as a stress-induced coping mechanism. © 2019 The Authors.

"Microbiota regulates type 1 diabetes through Toll-like receptors","Burrows MP, Volchkov P, Kobayashi KS, Chervonsky AV, Medzhitov R",2015,"Article","10.1073/pnas.1508740112","Deletion of the innate immune adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) results in microbiota-dependent protection from the disease: MyD88-negative mice in germfree (GF), but not in specific pathogen-free conditions develop the disease. These results could be explained by expansion of particular protective bacteria (""specific lineage hypothesis"") or by dominance of negative (tolerizing) signaling over proinflammatory signaling (""balanced signal hypothesis"") in mutant mice. Here we found that colonization of GF mice with a variety of intestinal bacteria was capable of reducing T1D in MyD88-negative (but not wild-type NOD mice), favoring the balanced signal hypothesis. However, the receptors and signaling pathways involved in prevention or facilitation of the disease remained unknown. The protective signals triggered by the microbiota were revealed by testing NOD mice lacking MyD88 in combination with knockouts of several critical components of innate immune sensing for development of T1D. Only MyD88- and TIR-domain containing adapter inducing IFN β (TRIF) double deficient NOD mice developed the disease. Thus, TRIF signaling (likely downstream of Toll-like receptor 4, TLR4) serves as one of the microbiota-induced tolerizing pathways. At the same time another TLR (TLR2) provided prodiabetic signaling by controlling the microbiota, as reduction in T1D incidence caused by TLR2 deletion was reversed in GF TLR2-negative mice. Our results support the balanced signal hypothesis, in which microbes provide signals that both promote and inhibit autoimmunity by signaling through different receptors, including receptors of the TLR family.","commensal microbiota; toll-like receptors; type 1 diabetes; myeloid differentiation factor 88; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor adaptor molecule 1; antiinfective agent; myeloid differentiation factor 88; ticam-1 protein, mouse; toll like receptor; vesicular transport adaptor protein; animal experiment; animal model; article; autoimmunity; commensal; controlled study; female; innate immunity; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; intestine flora; male; microbial community; microflora; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; ubiquitination; animal; bacterium; c57bl mouse; germfree animal; immunology; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; microbiology; nonobese diabetic mouse; pancreas islet; pathology; phylogeny; mus; adaptor proteins, vesicular transport; animals; anti-infective agents; bacteria; diabetes mellitus, type 1; germ-free life; islets of langerhans; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, inbred nod; microbiota; myeloid differentiation factor 88; phylogeny; toll-like receptors"
"Nod2 activates NF-kB in CD4+ T cells but its expression is dispensable for T cell-induced colitis","Zanello G, Goethel A, Forster K, Geddes K, Philpott DJ, Croitoru K",2013,"Article","10.1371/journal.pone.0082623","Although the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD) remains elusive this disease is characterized by T cell activation that leads to chronic inflammation and mucosal damage. A potential role for maladaptation between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune response is suggested by the fact that mutations in the pattern recognition receptor Nod2 are associated with higher risks for developing CD. Although Nod2 deletion in CD4+ T cells has been shown to impair the induction of colitis in the murine T cell transfer model, the analysis of T cell intrinsic Nod2 function in T cell differentiation and T cell-mediated immunity is inconsistent between several studies. In addition, the role of T cell intrinsic Nod2 in regulatory T cell (Treg) development and function during colitis remain to be analyzed. In this study, we show that Nod2 expression is higher in activated/memory CD4+ T cells and its expression was inducible after T cell receptor (TCR) ligation. Nod2 stimulation with muramyl dipeptide (MDP) led to a nuclear accumulation of c-Rel NF-kB subunit. Although functionally active in CD4+ T cells, the deletion of Nod2 did not impair the induction and the prevention of colitis in the T cell transfer model. Moreover, Nod2 deletion did not affect the development of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the spleen of recipient mice and Nod2 deficient CD4 T cells expressing the OVA specific transgenic TCR were able to differentiate in Foxp3+ Treg cells after OVA feeding. In vitro, CD25+ Nod2 deficient T cells suppressed T cell proliferation as well as wild type counter parts and T cell stimulation with MDP did not affect the proliferation and the cytokine secretion of T cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that Nod2 is functional in murine CD4+ T cells but its expression is dispensable for the T cell regulation of colitis.

"Bacterial dispersal and drift drive microbiome diversity patterns within a population of feral hindgut fermenters","Stothart MR, Greuel RJ, Gavriliuc S, Henry A, Wilson AJ, McLoughlin PD, Poissant J",2021,"Article","10.1111/mec.15747","Studies of microbiome variation in wildlife often emphasize host physiology and diet as proximate selective pressures acting on host-associated microbiota. In contrast, microbial dispersal and ecological drift are more rarely considered. Using amplicon sequencing, we characterized the bacterial microbiome of adult female (n = 86) Sable Island horses (Nova Scotia, Canada) as part of a detailed individual-based study of this feral population. Using data on sampling date, horse location, age, parental status, and local habitat variables, we contrasted the ability of spatiotemporal, life history, and environmental factors to explain microbiome diversity among Sable Island horses. We extended inferences made from these analyses with both phylogeny-informed and phylogeny-independent null modelling approaches to identify deviations from stochastic expectations. Phylogeny-informed diversity measures were correlated with spatial and local habitat variables, but null modelling results suggested that heterogeneity in ecological drift, rather than differential selective pressures acting on the microbiome, was responsible for these correlations. Conversely, phylogeny-independent diversity measures were best explained by host spatial and social structure, suggesting that taxonomic composition of the microbiome was shaped most strongly by bacterial dispersal. Parental status was important but correlated with measures of β-dispersion rather than β-diversity (mares without foals had lower alpha diversity and more variable microbiomes than mares with foals). Our results suggest that between host microbiome variation within the Sable Island horse population is driven more strongly by bacterial dispersal and ecological drift than by differential selective pressures.

However, no reports have compared the gut microbiota between wild and captive forest musk deer. To gain insight into the composition of gut microbiota in forest musk deer under different food-source conditions, we employed high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing technology to investigate differences in the gut microbiota occurring between captive and wild forest musk deer. Both captive and wild forest musk deer showed similar microbiota at the phylum level, which consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, although significant differences were found in their relative abundances between both groups. α-Diversity results showed that no significant differences occurred in the microbiota between both groups, while β-diversity results showed that significant differences did occur in their microbiota compositions.

However, the changes in gut microbiome composition in AD and their association with disease pathology, especially in the early stages, are unclear. Here, we compared the profiles of gut microbiota between APP/PS1 transgenic mice (an AD mouse model) and their wild-type littermates at different ages by amplicon-based sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Microbiota composition started diverging between the APP/PS1 and wild-type mice at young ages (i.e., 1-3 months), before obvious amyloid deposition and plaque-localized microglial activation in the cerebral cortex in APP/PS1 mice. At later ages (i.e., 6 and 9 months), there were distinct changes in the abundance of inflammation-related bacterial taxa including Escherichia-Shigella, Desulfovibrio, Akkermansia, and Blautia in APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that gut microbiota alterations precede the development of key pathological features of AD, including amyloidosis and plaque-localized neuroinflammation.

"Fitness costs of phoretic nematodes in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides","Wang Y, Rozen DE",2019,"Article","10.1002/ece3.4570","Nicrophorusvespilloides is a social beetle that rears its offspring on decomposing carrion. Wild beetles are frequently associated with two types of macrobial symbionts, mites, and nematodes. Although these organisms are believed to be phoretic commensals that harmlessly use beetles as a means of transfer between carcasses, the role of these symbionts on N. vespilloides fitness is poorly understood. Here, we show that nematodes have significant negative effects on beetle fitness across a range of worm densities and also quantify the density-dependent transmission of worms between mating individuals and from parents to offspring. Using field-caught beetles, we provide the first report of a new nematode symbiont in N. vespilloides, most closely related to Rhabditoides regina, and show that worm densities are highly variable across individuals isolated from nature but do not differ between males and females. Next, by inoculating mating females with increasing densities of nematodes, we show that worm infections significantly reduce brood size, larval survival, and larval mass, and also eliminate the trade-off between brood size and larval mass. Finally, we show that nematodes are efficiently transmitted between mating individuals and from mothers to larvae, directly and indirectly via the carcass, and that worms persist through pupation. These results show that the phoretic nematode R. regina can be highly parasitic to burying beetles but can nevertheless persist because of efficient mechanisms of intersexual and intergenerational transmission. Phoretic species are exceptionally common and may cause significant harm to their hosts, even though they rely on these larger species for transmission to new resources.

"Isoxanthohumol, a constituent of hop (Humulus lupulus L.), increases stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans dependent on the transcription factor DAF-16","Büchter C, Havermann S, Koch K, Wätjen W",2016,"Article","10.1007/s00394-015-0843-z","Purpose: The flavanone isoxanthohumol (IX) has gained attention as antioxidative and chemopreventive agent, but the molecular mechanism of action remains unclear. We investigated effects of this secondary plant compound in vivo using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Methods: Adult C. elegans nematodes were incubated with IX, and then, the stress resistance was analysed in the SYTOX assay; lifespan was monitored by touch-provoked movement method, the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured in the DCF assay, and the nuclear localisation of the transcription factor DAF-16 was analysed by using a transgenic strain. By the use of a DAF-16 loss-of-function strain, we analysed whether the effects are dependent on DAF-16. Results: IX increases the resistance of the nematode against thermal stress. Additionally, a reduction in ROS in vivo was caused by IX. Since the flavanone only has a marginal radical-scavenging capacity (TEAC assay), we suggest that IX mediates its antioxidative effects indirectly via activation of DAF-16 (homologue to mammalian FOXO proteins). The nuclear translocation of this transcription factor is increased by IX. In the DAF-16-mutated strain, the IX-mediated increase in stress resistance was completely abolished; furthermore, an increased formation of ROS and a reduced lifespan was mediated by IX. Conclusion: IX or a bacterial metabolite of IX causes antioxidative effects as well as an increased stress resistance in C. elegans via activation of DAF-16. The homologous pathway may have implications in the molecular mechanism of IX in mammals. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","ageing; beer; daf-16; nutrition; oxidative stress; secondary plant compounds; isoxanthohumol; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor daf 16; trolox c; antioxidant; caenorhabditis elegans protein; daf-16 protein, c elegans; flavanone; flavanone derivative; forkhead transcription factor; isoxanthohumol; reactive oxygen metabolite; xanthone derivative; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; antioxidant assay; article; caenorhabditis elegans; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; heat stress; humulus lupulus; lifespan; loss of function mutation; nonhuman; sytox assay; trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity assay; wild type; young adult; animal; caenorhabditis elegans; chemistry; drug effects; genetics; humulus; longevity; metabolism; oxidative stress; animals; antioxidants; caenorhabditis elegans; caenorhabditis elegans proteins; flavanones; forkhead transcription factors; humulus; longevity; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species; xanthones"
"Diet, habitat environment and lifestyle conversion affect the gut microbiomes of giant pandas","Jin L, Huang Y, Yang S, Wu D, Li C, Deng W, Zhao K, He Y, Li B, Zhang G, Xiong Y, Wei R, Li G, Wu H, Zhang H, Zou L",2021,"Article","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145316","Gut microbiota (GM) are important for the health of giant pandas (GPs), in addition to the utilization of bamboo in their diets. However, it is not fully understood how diet, habitat environment and lifestyle contribute to the composition of GM in GP. Consequently, we evaluated how dietary changes, habitat environment conversions and lifestyle shifts influence the GM of GPs using high-throughput sequencing and genome-resolved metagenomics. The GM of GPs were more similar when their hosts exhibited the same diet. High fiber diets significantly increased the diversity and decreased the richness of gut bacterial communities alone or interacted with the age factor (p < 0.05). The abundances of Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium significantly increased during diet conversion process (Non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, LDA > 4). Reconstruction of 60 metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) indicated that these bacteria were likely responsible for bamboo digestion via gene complements involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin degradation. While habitat environment may play a more important role in shaping the GM of GP, lifestyle can also greatly affect bacterial communities. The GM structure in reintroduced GPs notably converged to that of wild pandas. Importantly, the main bacterial genera of wild GPs could aid in lignin degradation, while those of reintroduced GPs were related to cellulose and hemicellulose digestion. Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium may contribute to lignocellulose digestion in GP. The results revealed that diet conversion, habitat environment and lifestyle could remarkably influence the GM of GP. In addition, results suggested that increasing the ability of lignin degradation with GM may aid to change the GM of reintroduced pandas to resemble those of wild pandas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","diet conversion; giant panda; gut microbiota; habitat environment; lifestyle; bamboo; biodegradation; cellulose; clostridium; lignin; bacterial community; bacterial genus; cellulose and hemicellulose; conversion process; dietary changes; high-throughput sequencing; lignin degradation; non-parametric; ecosystems; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; cellulose; dietary intake; habitat management; lifestyle; mammal; microbial activity; acinetobacter; article; clostridium; controlled study; dietary intake; enterococcus; giant panda; high fiber diet; high throughput sequencing; intestine flora; lactococcus; lifestyle modification; metagenome; microbial community; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; protein degradation; pseudomonas; species habitat; species richness; streptococcus; animal; bear; diet; ecosystem; lifestyle; bamboo; biodegradation; cellulose; conversion; digestion; ecosystems; processes; acinetobacter; ailuropoda melanoleuca; bacteria (microorganisms); clostridium; enterococcus; lactococcus; microbiota; pseudomonas; streptococcus; animals; diet; ecosystem; gastrointestinal microbiome; life style; ursidae"

The LC is among the first brain regions affected by a-synuclein (asyn) pathology, yet how asyn affects these neurons remains unclear. LC-derived norepinephrine (NE) can stimulate neuroprotective mechanisms and modulate immune cells, while dysregulation of NE neurotransmission may exacerbate disease progression, particularly nonmotor symptoms, and contribute to the chronic neuroinflammation associated with PD pathology. Although transgenic mice overexpressing asyn have previously been developed, transgene expression is usually driven by pan-neuronal promoters and thus has not been selectively targeted to LC neurons. Here we report a novel transgenic mouse expressing human wild-type asyn under control of the noradrenergic-specific dopamine b-hydroxylase promoter (DBH-hSNCA). These mice developed oligomeric and conformation-specific asyn in LC neurons, alterations in hippocampal and LC microglial abundance, upregulated GFAP expression, degeneration of LC fibers, decreased striatal DA metabolism, and age-dependent behaviors reminiscent of nonmotor symptoms of PD that were rescued by adrenergic receptor antagonists. These mice provide novel insights into how asyn pathology affects LC neurons and how central noradrenergic dysfunction may contribute to early PD pathophysiology. © 2020 the authors.","a-synuclein; aging; locus ceruleus; nonmotor; norepinephrine; parkinson's disease; alpha synuclein; oligomer; oxygenase; alpha synuclein; animal experiment; animal model; article; bacterial artificial chromosome; cell degeneration; controlled study; dopamine metabolism; female; gene expression regulation; hippocampus; locus ceruleus; male; microglia; mouse; neuropathology; nonhuman; noradrenergic nerve cell; parkinson disease; priority journal; promoter region; protein conformation; transgenic mouse; upregulation; wild type mouse; adrenergic nerve cell; animal; c57bl mouse; circadian rhythm; genetics; gliosis; human; locus ceruleus; metabolism; movement (physiology); parkinson disease; pathology; pathophysiology; adrenergic neurons; alpha-synuclein; animals; circadian rhythm; female; gliosis; hippocampus; humans; locus coeruleus; male; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; microglia; movement; parkinson disease"

In this study, we developed a novel and safe LM-based vaccine vector platform, by engineering a triple attenuated mutant (Lm3Dx) (ΔactA, ΔinlA, ΔinlB) of the wild-type LM strain JF5203 (CC 1, phylogenetic lineage I). We demonstrated the strong attenuation of Lm3Dx while maintaining its capacity to selectively infect antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vitro. Furthermore, as proof of concept, we introduced the immunodominant Neospora caninum (Nc) surface antigen NcSAG1 into Lm3Dx. The NcSAG1 protein was expressed by Lm3Dx_SAG1 during cellular infection. To demonstrate safety of Lm3Dx_SAG1 in vivo, we vaccinated BALB/C mice by intramuscular injection. Following vaccination, mice did not suffer any adverse effects and only sporadically shed bacteria at very low levels in the feces (&lt;100 CFU/g). Additionally, bacterial load in internal organs was very low to absent at day 1.5 and 4 following the 1st vaccination and at 2 and 4 weeks after the second boost, independently of the physiological status of the mice. Additionally, vaccination of mice prior and during pregnancy did not interfere with pregnancy outcome. However, Lm3Dx_SAG1 was shed into the milk when inoculated during lactation, although it did not cause any clinical adverse effects in either dams or pups. Also, we have indications that the vector persists more days in the injected muscle of lactating mice. Therefore, impact of physiological status on vector dynamics in the host and mechanisms of milk shedding requires further investigation. In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that Lm3Dx is a safe vaccine vector in non-lactating animals. Additionally, we provide first indications that mice vaccinated with Lm3Dx_SAG1 develop a strong and Th1-biased immune response against the Lm3Dx-expressed neospora antigen. These results encourage to further investigate the efficiency of Lm3Dx_SAG1 to prevent and treat clinical neosporosis. © Copyright © 2021 Pownall, Imhof, Trigo, Ganal-Vonarburg, Plattet, Monney, Forterre, Hemphill and Oevermann.","immune response; in vitro safety; in vivo safety; listeria monocytogenes; microbial vaccine; neospora caninum; neosporosis; "
"Candida albicans Colonizes and Disseminates to the Gastrointestinal Tract in the Presence of the Microbiota in a Severe Combined Immunodeficient Mouse Model","Pan C-H, Lo H-J, Yan J-Y, Hsiao Y-J, Hsueh J-W, Lin D-W, Lin T-H, Wu S-H, Chen Y-C",2021,"Article","10.3389/fmicb.2020.619878","Candida albicans is the leading cause of candidemia or other invasive candidiasis. Gastrointestinal colonization has been considered as the primary source of candidemia. However, few established mouse models that mimic this infection route are available. In the present study, we established a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis developed through the translocation of Candida from the gut. In this study, we developed a novel C. albicans GI colonization and dissemination animal model by using severe combined immunodeficient Rag2–/–IL2γc–/– (Rag2γc) mice, which lack functional T, B, NK cells, and IL2γc-dependent signaling. Rag2γc mice were highly susceptible to C. albicans gastrointestinal infection even in the presence of the gut microbiota. Within 4 weeks post infection, Rag2γc mice showed dose-dependent weight loss and disseminated candidiasis in more than 58% (7/12) of moribund mice. Histological analysis demonstrated abundant hyphae penetrating the mucosa, with significant neutrophilic infiltration in mice infected with wild-type C. albicans but not a filamentation-defective mutant. In moribund Rag2γc mice, the necrotic lesions and disrupted epithelial cells were associated with C. albicans hyphae. Notably, removal of the gut microbiota by antibiotics exacerbated the severity of fungal infection in Rag2γc mice, as demonstrated by elevated fungal burdens and accelerated weight loss and death. Furthermore, higher fungal burden and IL-1β expression were prominently noted in the stomach of Rag2γc mice. In fact, a significant increase in circulating proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10, indicative of a septic response, was evident in infected Rag2γc mice. Additionally, Rag2γc mice exhibited significantly lower levels of IL-22 but not IFN-γ or IL-17A than wild-type B6 mice, suggesting that IL-22 plays a role in C. albicans gastrointestinal infection. Collectively, our analysis of the Rag2γc mouse model revealed features of C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination without the interference from antibiotics or chemotherapeutic agents, thus offering a new investigative tool for delineating the pathogenesis of C. albicans and its cross-talk with the gut microbiota. © Copyright © 2021 Pan, Lo, Yan, Hsiao, Hsueh, Lin, Lin, Wu and Chen.","candida albicans; disseminated candidiasis; gastrointestinal colonization; immunodeficient mice; interleukin-22; mouse model; diaminobenzidine; eosin; formaldehyde; gamma interferon; hematoxylin; horseradish peroxidase; immunoglobulin g antibody; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 22; interleukin 6; paraffin; penicillamine derivative; phosphate buffered saline; rna 16s; streptomycin; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight loss; candida albicans; candidiasis; cell infiltration; controlled study; cytokine response; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epithelium cell; feces analysis; feces microflora; female; fungal colonization; fungal strain; fungus culture; fungus hyphae; gastrointestinal infection; gastrointestinal tract; gene expression; histology; histopathology; intestine flora; mouse; natural killer cell; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rna isolation; scid mouse; signal transduction"

However, bar-headed geese in captivity display a reduced reproductive rate. The gut microbiome has been shown to influence host factors such as nutrient and energy metabolism, immune homeostasis and reproduction. It is therefore of great scientific and agriculture value to analyze the microbial communities associated with bar-headed geese in order to improve their reproductive rate. Here we describe the first comparative study of the gut microbial communities of bar-headed geese in three different breeding pattern groups by 16S. rRNA sequences using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The results showed that Firmicutes predominated (58.33%) among wild bar-headed geese followed by Proteobacteria (30.67%), Actinobacteria (7.33%) and Bacteroidetes (3.33%). In semi-artificial breeding group, Firmicutes was also the most abundant bacteria (62.00%), followed by Bacteroidetes (28.67%), Proteobacteria (4.20%), Actinobacteria (3.27%) and Fusobacteria (1.51%). The microbial communities of artificial breeding group were dominated by Firmicutes (60.67%), Fusobacteria (29.67%) and Proteobacteria (9.33%). Wild bar-headed geese had a significant higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while semi-artificial breeding bar-headed geese had significantly more Bacteroidetes. The semi-artificial breeding group had the highest microbial community diversity and richness, followed by wild group, and then the artificial breeding group. The marked differences of genus level group-specific microbes create a baseline for future bar-headed goose microbiology research. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.","artificial breeding; bar-headed goose; domestication; gut microbiome; bacteria; metabolism; rna; artificial breedings; comparative analysis; comparative studies; domestication; high-throughput sequencing; microbial communities; microbiome; reproductive rates; ecology; biome; comparative study; domestication; microbial community; relative abundance; rna; waterfowl; china; actinobacteria; anser indicus; aves; bacteroidetes; firmicutes; fusobacteria; proteobacteria; animal; bacterium; biodiversity; breeding; china; classification; comparative study; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; goose; growth, development and aging; intestine flora; isolation and purification; microbiology; phylogeny; animals; bacteria; biodiversity; breeding; china; gastrointestinal microbiome; gastrointestinal tract; geese; phylogeny"

In this study, homologous juvenile turtles were allocated to lake, pond and paddy field to investigate the habitat effects on turtles. Results: The growth, morphology and gut microbial communities were monitored during the 4 months cultural period. It showed higher growth rate of turtles in paddy field and pond. The appearance, visceral coefficients, gut morphology and microbial communities in turtles were distinct among different habitats. The microbial community richness on Chao1 was obviously lower in initial turtle guts from greenhouses, whereas it was relative higher in turtle guts sampled from paddy fields than ponds and lake. Significant differences on dominant microbes were found among initial and subsequent samples from different habitats. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in the guts of turtles sampled from the greenhouse initially, while Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum after cultivation in different habitats, followed by Bacteroidetes. The microbial composition were distinct in different habitats at 60d, and the appearance of dominant phyla and genera was more driven by sampling time than habitats at 120d. Both the sampling time and habitats affected the appearance of dominant phyla and genera during the cultivation. The functional predictions indicated that both habitat type and sampling time had significant effects on metabolic pathways, especially amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Conclusions: The turtles could adapt to natural lakes, artificial ponds and paddy fields. The gut microbial abundance was different among the habitats and sampling time. The species of microbes were significantly more diverse in paddy field specimens than in those from ponds and lakes.

The bioaccumulation and environmental persistence of DEHP cause serious global health effects in wildlife animals and human, especially hepatotoxicity. Herein, to explore the mechanisms of DEHP induced hepatotoxicity, quail were exposed with 0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW/day DEHP by gavage administration daily for 45 days. Notably, the adipose tissue degeneration was observed in the liver of DEHP-exposed quail under the histopathological analysis. DEHP exposure increased the peroxidation product (MDA), GSH and GST, but decreased antioxidant function (T-AOC, SOD and GPX). DEHP induced the oxidative stress and pulsed on NRF2 signal pathway through activating downstream genes. Furthermore, DEHP induced mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) was activated to relieve mitochondrial dysfunctions and mitigated oxidative stress. These findings showed that mitochondrial functions and redox homeostasis were affected by DEHP and resulted in irreversible hepatic injury. In Conclusion, this study suggested that DEHP-induced hepatotoxicity in quail was associated with activating the NRF2 mediated antioxidant defense and mtUPR.

"Macrophages recognize the Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion system in the absence of toll-like receptor signalling","Koch M, Mollenkopf H-J, Meyer TF",2016,"Article","10.1111/cmi.12492","Helicobacter pylori strains carrying the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) provoke an increased inflammatory response, conferring an increased risk of ulcer formation and carcinogenesis. How the immune system recognizes the presence of cagPAI positive strains is yet unclear. By comparing the transcriptional response of wild type and MyD88/Trif-/- bone marrow macrophages to infection with H.pylori, we found that the majority of regulated genes were dependent on toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling. To determine the role of TLR-independent responses, we analysed the transcriptome of MyD88/Trif-/- bone marrow macrophages at different time points after infection with cagPAI positive versus negative strains. We identified a group of genes that exhibited different kinetic behaviour depending on whether cagPAI was present. Analysis of their gene expression kinetics demonstrated that this responsiveness to cagPAI was observed only in MyD88/Trif-/- macrophages. This group of cagPAI-sensing genes was enriched for AU-rich element containing early response genes involved in immune regulation, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Recognition of cagPAI positive strains was found to be mediated by the type IV secretion system (cagT4SS), rather than its effector protein CagA.

"Small bowel fibrosis and systemic inflammatory response after ileocolonic anastomosis in IL-10 null mice","Borowiec AM, Sydora BC, Doyle J, Guan LL, Churchill TA, Madsen K, Fedorak RN",2012,"Article","10.1016/j.jss.2012.01.048","Background: Crohn's disease recurrence after an ileocecal resection is common; yet, its pathophysiology is poorly understood and available treatment is suboptimal. The purpose of this study was to examine the bacterial, local, and systemic immune changes that follow ileocolonic anastomosis in a rodent model of Crohn's disease, the interleukin-10 gene-deficient (IL-10 null) mice. Materials and methods: We divided wild-type and IL-10 null mice into three treatment groups: ileocolonic anastomosis, sham operation (ileo-ileal anastomosis), and control group without an operation. We sacrificed mice at 6 and 15 wks after the operation. At 6 wks, we assessed bacterial changes using the denaturing gel electrophoresis and similarity coefficient calculation. At both time points, we examined the small bowel for inflammation and fibrosis with histology. We measured the interferon gamma secretion by splenocytes stimulated with gastrointestinal bacterial antigens and splenocyte composition as a marker of systemic response. Results: At 6 wks, ileocolonic anastomosis resulted in increased similarity in bacterial species between the ileum and colon. The ileocolonic anastomosis did not lead to significant inflammation in the small intestine, but it resulted in an increased collagen deposition in all animals undergoing surgery, the most pronounced fibrosis of which was present in IL-10 null mice 15 wks after ileocolonic anastomosis. Furthermore, this was associated with significantly increased interferon gamma secretion by bacterial antigen-stimulated splenocytes and a decreased number of CD11+ cells in the same experimental group. Conclusions: Ileocolonic anastomosis leads to bacterial changes in the terminal ileum. In the genetically susceptible host, it is associated with small bowel fibrosis and systemic immune alterations. The composition of immune cells in the spleen is altered and splenocytes hypersecrete proinflammatory cytokine (interferon gamma) when challenged with gastrointestinal bacterial antigens. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"Associations between hepatic miRNA expression, liver triacylglycerols and gut microbiota during metabolic adaptation to high-fat diet in mice","Blasco-Baque V, Coupé B, Fabre A, Handgraaf S, Gourdy P, Arnal J-F, Courtney M, Schuster-Klein C, Guardiola B, Tercé F, Burcelin R, Serino M",2017,"Article","10.1007/s00125-017-4209-3","Aims/hypothesis: Despite the current pandemic of metabolic diseases, our understanding of the diverse nature of the development of metabolic alterations in people who eat a high-fat diet (HFD) is still poor. We recently demonstrated a cardio-metabolic adaptation in mice fed an HFD, which was characterised by a specific gut and periodontal microbiota profile. Since the severity of hepatic disease is characterised by specific microRNA (miRNA) signatures and the gut microbiota is a key driver of both hepatic disease and miRNA expression, we analysed the expression of three hepatic miRNA and studied their correlation with hepatic triacylglycerol content and gut microbiota. Methods: Two cohorts of C57BL/6 4-week-old wild-type (WT) male mice (n = 62 and n = 96) were fed an HFD for 3 months to provide a model of metabolic adaptation. Additionally 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice, either WT or of different genotypes, with diverse gut microbiota (ob/ob, Nod1, Cd14 knockout [Cd14KO] and Nod2) or without gut microbiota (axenic mice) were fed a normal chow diet. Following which, glycaemic index, body weight, blood glucose levels and hepatic triacylglycerol levels were measured. Gut (caecum) microbiota taxa were analysed by pyrosequencing. To analyse hepatic miRNA expression, real-time PCR was performed on total extracted miRNA samples. Data were analysed using two-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett’s post hoc test, or by the unpaired Student’s t test. A cluster analysis and multivariate analyses were also performed. Results: Our results demonstrated that the expression of miR-181a, miR-666 and miR-21 in primary murine hepatocytes is controlled by lipopolysaccharide in a dose-dependent manner. Of the gut microbiota, Firmicutes were positively correlated and Proteobacteria and Bacteroides acidifaciens were negatively correlated with liver triacylglycerol levels.

In contrast, the relative abundance of B. acidifaciens was positively correlated with miR-21.

"Intestinotrophic glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) activates intestinal gene expression and growth factor-dependent pathways independent of the vasoactive intestinal peptide gene in mice","Yusta B, Holland D, Waschek JA, Drucker DJ",2012,"Article","10.1210/en.2012-1069","The enteroendocrine and enteric nervous systems convey signals through an overlapping network of regulatory peptides that act either as circulating hormones or as localized neurotransmitters within the gastrointestinal tract. Because recent studies invoke an important role for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as a downstream mediator of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) action in the gut, we examined the importance of the VIP-GLP-2 interaction through analysis of Vip -/- mice. Unexpectedly, we detected abnormal villous architecture, expansion of the crypt compartment, increased crypt cell proliferation, enhanced Igf1 and Kgf gene expression, and reduced expression of Paneth cell products in the Vip -/- small bowel. These abnormalities were not reproduced by antagonizing VIP action in wild-type mice, and VIP administration did not reverse the intestinal phenotype of Vip -/- mice. Exogenous administration of GLP-2 induced the expression of ErbB ligands and immediate-early genes to similar levels in Vip +/+ vs. Vip -/- mice. Moreover, GLP-2 significantly increased crypt cell proliferation and small bowel growth to comparable levels in Vip +/+ vs. Vip -/- mice. Unexpectedly, exogenous GLP-2 administration had no therapeutic effect in mice with dextran sulfate-induced colitis; the severity of colonic injury and weight loss was modestly reduced in female but not male Vip -/- mice. Taken together, these findings extend our understanding of the complex intestinal phenotype arising from loss of the Vip gene. Furthermore, although VIP action may be important for the antiinflammatory actions of GLP-2, the Vip gene is not required for induction of a gene expression program linked to small bowel growth after enhancement of GLP-2 receptor signaling.

"Wild black bears harbor simple gut microbial communities with little difference between the jejunum and colon","Gillman SJ, McKenney EA, Lafferty DJR",2020,"Article","10.1038/s41598-020-77282-w","The gut microbiome (GMB), comprising the commensal microbial communities located in the gastrointestinal tract, has co-evolved in mammals to perform countless micro-ecosystem services to facilitate physiological functions. Because of the complex inter-relationship between mammals and their gut microbes, the number of studies addressing the role of the GMB on mammalian health is almost exclusively limited to human studies and model organisms. Furthermore, much of our knowledge of wildlife–GMB relationships is based on studies of colonic GMB communities derived from the feces of captive specimens, leaving our understanding of the GMB in wildlife limited. To better understand wildlife–GMB relationships, we engaged hunters as citizen scientists to collect biological samples from legally harvested black bears (Ursus americanus) and used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize wild black bear GMB communities in the colon and jejunum, two functionally distinct regions of the gastrointestinal tract. We determined that the jejunum and colon of black bears do not harbor significantly different GMB communities: both gastrointestinal sites were dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. However, a number of bacteria were differentially enriched in each site, with the colon harboring twice as many enriched taxa, primarily from closely related lineages. © 2020, The Author(s).","; rna 16s; animal; bear; biodiversity; classification; colon; female; firmicutes; genetics; intestine flora; isolation and purification; jejunum; male; microbiology; phylogeny; proteobacteria; wild animal; animals; animals, wild; biodiversity; colon; female; firmicutes; gastrointestinal microbiome; jejunum; male; phylogeny; proteobacteria; rna, ribosomal, 16s; ursidae"
"Cyclosporine biosynthesis in Tolypocladium inflatum benefits fungal adaptation to the environment","Yang X, Feng P, Yin Y, Bushley K, Spatafora JW, Wang C",2018,"Article","10.1128/mBio.01211-18","The cycloundecapeptide cyclosporin A (CsA) was first isolated from the insect-pathogenic fungus Tolypocladium inflatum for its antifungal activity and later developed as an immunosuppressant drug. However, the full biosynthetic mechanism of CsA remains unknown and has puzzled researchers for decades. In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster is suggested to include 12 genes encoding enzymes, including the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) (SimA) responsible for assembling the 11 amino acid substrates of cyclosporine and a polyketide synthase (PKS) (SimG) to mediate the production of the unusual amino acid (4R)-4-[(E)-2-butenyl]-4-methyl-L-threonine (Bmt). Individual deletion of 10 genes, isolation of intermediates, and substrate feeding experiments show that Bmt is biosynthesized by three enzymes, including SimG, SimI, and SimJ. The substrateD-alanine is catalyzed fromL-alanine by alanine racemase SimB. Gene cluster transcription is regulated by a putative basic leucine zipper (bZIP)-type protein encoded by the cluster gene SimL. We also found that the cluster cyclophilin (SimC) and transporter (SimD) genes contribute to the tolerance of CsA in the CsA-producing fungus. We also found that cyclosporine production could enable the fungus to outcompete other fungi during cocultivation tests. Deletion of the CsA biosynthetic genes also impaired fungal virulence against insect hosts. Taking all the data together, in addition to proposing a biosynthetic pathway of cyclosporines, the results of this study suggest that CsA produced by this fungus might play important ecological roles in fungal environment interactions. IMPORTANCE The cyclopeptide cyclosporin A was first isolated from the filamentous fungus Tolypocladium inflatum showing antifungal activity and was later developed as an immunosuppressant drug. We report the biosynthetic mechanism of cyclosporines that are mediated by a cluster of genes encoding NRPS and PKS controlled by a bZIP-type transcriptional regulator. The two unusual amino acids Bmt andD-Ala are produced by the PKS pathway and alanine racemase, respectively. The cyclophilin and transporter genes jointly contribute to fungal self-protection against cyclosporines. Cyclosporine confers on T. inflatum the abilities to outcompete other fungi in competitive interactions and to facilitate fungal infection of insect hosts, which therefore benefits fungal adaptations to different environments. © 2018 Yang et al.","antifungal activity; biosynthetic pathway; cyclosporine; tolypocladium inflatum; virulence; abc transporter; alanine; alanine racemase; aminotransferase; cyclophilin; cyclosporin b; cyclosporin c; cyclosporine; cytochrome p450; nonribosomal peptide synthetase; polyketide synthase; transcription factor; antifungal agent; cyclosporine; enzyme; fungal protein; article; aspergillus flavus; catalysis; controlled study; drug synthesis; evolutionary adaptation; filamentous fungus; fungal gene; fungal genome; fungal virulence; gene cluster; gene deletion; gene location; homologous recombination; insect; mutant; nonhuman; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rna extraction; rna sequence; sequence homology; sima gene; simb gene; simc gene; simd gene; simg gene; simi gene; simj gene; siml gene; tinf06009 gene; tolypocladium inflatum; transcription regulation; wild type; adaptation; animal; antibiosis; biosynthesis; drug tolerance; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; hypocreales; metabolism; microbiology; multigene family; physiology; adaptation, physiological; animals; antibiosis; antifungal agents; biosynthetic pathways; cyclosporine; drug tolerance; enzymes; fungal proteins; gene deletion; gene expression regulation, fungal; hypocreales; insecta; multigene family; transcription, genetic"

To understand the response mechanisms of the structure and function of small intestinal mucosa to environmental temperature, we investigated the effects of cold acclimation on small intestinal mucosal structure and mucosal immunity-associated cells in Brandt's voles(Lasiopodomys brandtii). We found that: (1)The villus length and the ratio of villus length to crypt depth(V/C) in the cold group were higher than that in the control group. (2)Cold acclimation increased the number of endothelial lymphocytes in the small intestine. (3)Cold acclimation significantly increased the number of goblet cells in the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum.

"Toll-like receptor 9 plays a key role in the autonomic cardiac and baroreflex control of arterial pressure","Rodrigues FL, Silva LEV, Hott SC, Bomfim GF, Da Silva CAA, Fazan R, Jr, Resstel LBM, Tostes RC, Carneiro FS",2015,"Article","10.1152/ajpregu.00150.2014","The crosstalk between the immune and the autonomic nervous system may impact the cardiovascular function. Toll-like receptors are components of the innate immune system and play developmental and physiological roles. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart failure. Since such diseases are commonly accompanied by autonomic imbalance and lower baroreflex sensitivity, we hypothesized that TLR9 modulates cardiac autonomic and baroreflex control of arterial pressure (AP). Toll-like receptor 9 knockout (TLR9 KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were implanted with catheters into carotid artery and jugular vein and allowed to recover for 3 days. After basal recording of AP, mice received methyl-atropine or propranolol. AP and pulse interval (PI) variability were evaluated in the time and frequency domain (spectral analysis), as well as by multiscale entropy. Spontaneous baroreflex was studied by sequence technique. Behavioral and cardiovascular responses to fear-conditioning stress were also evaluated. AP was similar between groups, but TLR9 KO mice exhibited lower basal heart rate (HR). AP variability was not different, but PI variability was increased in TLR9 KO mice. The total entropy was higher in TLR9 KO mice. Moreover, baroreflex function was found higher in TLR9 KO mice. Atropine-induced tachycardia was increased in TLR9 KO mice, whereas the propranolol-induced bradycardia was similar to WT mice. TLR9 KO mice exhibit increased behavioral and decreased tachycardia responses to fear-conditioning stress. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TLR9 may negatively modulate cardiac vagal tone and baroreflex in mice. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.","parasympathetic nervous system; spontaneous baroreflex; tlr9; methylatropine; propranolol; toll like receptor 9; atropine derivative; tlr9 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 9; animal cell; animal experiment; arterial pressure; article; behavior; bradycardia; cardiovascular response; cholinergic system; controlled study; entropy; footshock; heart rate; male; mouse; nonhuman; pressoreceptor reflex; priority journal; stress; tachycardia; vagus tone; animal; animal behavior; c57bl mouse; cardiovascular system; chemically induced; conditioning; deficiency; disease model; fear; genetics; immunology; innate immunity; innervation; knockout mouse; metabolism; pathophysiology; signal transduction; time; vagus nerve; animals; arterial pressure; atropine derivatives; baroreflex; behavior, animal; bradycardia; cardiovascular system; conditioning (psychology); disease models, animal; fear; heart rate; immunity, innate; male; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; propranolol; signal transduction; tachycardia; time factors; toll-like receptor 9; vagus nerve"
"Toward an integrative molecular approach to wildlife disease","DeCandia AL, Dobson AP, vonHoldt BM",2018,"Article","10.1111/cobi.13083","Pathogens pose serious threats to human health, agricultural investment, and biodiversity conservation through the emergence of zoonoses, spillover to domestic livestock, and epizootic outbreaks. As such, wildlife managers are often tasked with mitigating the negative effects of disease. Yet, parasites form a major component of biodiversity that often persist. This is due to logistical challenges of implementing management strategies and to insufficient understanding of host–parasite dynamics. We advocate for an inclusive understanding of molecular diversity in driving parasite infection and variable host disease states in wildlife systems. More specifically, we examine the roles of genetic, epigenetic, and commensal microbial variation in disease pathogenesis. These include mechanisms underlying parasite virulence and host resistance and tolerance, and the development, regulation, and parasite subversion of immune pathways, among other processes. Case studies of devil facial tumor disease in Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and chytridiomycosis in globally distributed amphibians exemplify the broad range of questions that can be addressed by examining different facets of molecular diversity. For particularly complex systems, integrative molecular analyses present a promising frontier that can provide critical insights necessary to elucidate disease dynamics operating across scales. These insights enable more accurate risk assessment, reconstruction of transmission pathways, discernment of optimal intervention strategies, and development of more effective and ecologically sound treatments that minimize damage to the host population and environment.

"Perinatal antibiotic-induced shifts in gut microbiota have differential effects on inflammatory lung diseases","Russell SL, Gold MJ, Reynolds LA, Willing BP, Dimitriu P, Thorson L, Redpath SA, Perona-Wright G, Blanchet M-R, Mohn WW, Finlay BB, McNagny KM",2015,"Article","10.1016/j.jaci.2014.06.027","Background Resident gut microbiota are now recognized as potent modifiers of host immune responses in various scenarios. Recently, we demonstrated that perinatal exposure to vancomycin, but not streptomycin, profoundly alters gut microbiota and enhances susceptibility to a TH2 model of allergic asthma.Objective Here we sought to further clarify the etiology of these changes by determining whether perinatal antibiotic treatment has a similar effect on the TH1/TH17-mediated lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis.Methods Hypersensitivity pneumonitis was induced in C57BL/6 wild-type or recombination-activating gene 1-deficient mice treated perinatally with vancomycin or streptomycin by repeated intranasal administration of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula antigen. Disease severity was assessed by measuring lung inflammation, pathology, cytokine responses, and serum antibodies. Microbial community analyses were performed on stool samples via 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and correlations between disease severity and specific bacterial taxa were identified.Results Surprisingly, in contrast to our findings in an allergic asthma model, we found that the severity of hypersensitivity pneumonitis was unaffected by vancomycin, but increased dramatically after streptomycin treatment. This likely reflects an effect on the adaptive, rather than innate, immune response because the effects of streptomycin were not observed during the early phases of disease and were abrogated in recombination-activating gene 1-deficient mice. Interestingly, Bacteroidetes dominated the intestinal microbiota of streptomycin-treated animals, while vancomycin promoted the expansion of the Firmicutes.Conclusions Perinatal antibiotics exert highly selective effects on resident gut flora, which, in turn, lead to very specific alterations in susceptibility to TH2- or TH1/TH17-driven lung inflammatory disease. © 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.","antibiotics; asthma; bacteroidetes; firmicutes; gut microbiota; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; perinatal; rag1 protein; rna 16s; streptomycin; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; cytokine; immunoglobulin g; streptomycin; vancomycin; allergic asthma; allergic pneumonitis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibiotic therapy; article; bacteroidetes; c57bl 6 mouse; controlled study; correlational study; cytokine response; disease severity; feces analysis; firmicutes; innate immunity; intestine flora; microbial community; mouse; nonhuman; perinatal period; pyrosequencing; repeated drug dose; saccharopolyspora rectivirgula; th1 th2 balance; wild type; allergic pneumonitis; animal; blood; c57bl mouse; gastrointestinal tract; immunology; lung; microbiology; microflora; newborn; pathology; saccharopolyspora; severity of illness index; alveolitis, extrinsic allergic; animals; animals, newborn; anti-bacterial agents; cytokines; gastrointestinal tract; immunoglobulin g; lung; mice, inbred c57bl; microbiota; saccharopolyspora; severity of illness index; streptomycin; vancomycin"
"Comparable response of wild rodent gut microbiome to anthropogenic habitat contamination","Lavrinienko A, Hämäläinen A, Hindström R, Tukalenko E, Boratyński Z, Kivisaari K, Mousseau TA, Watts PC, Mappes T",2021,"Article","10.1111/mec.15945","Species identity is thought to dominate over environment in shaping wild rodent gut microbiota, but it remains unknown whether the responses of host gut microbiota to shared anthropogenic habitat impacts are species-specific or if the general gut microbiota response is similar across host species. Here, we compare the influence of exposure to radionuclide contamination on the gut microbiota of four wild mouse species: Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, A. speciosus and A. argenteus. Building on the evidence that radiation impacts bank vole (Myodes glareolus) gut microbiota, we hypothesized that radiation exposure has a general impact on rodent gut microbiota. Because we sampled (n = 288) two species pairs of Apodemus mice that occur in sympatry in habitats affected by the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents, these comparisons provide an opportunity for a general assessment of the effects of exposure to environmental contamination (radionuclides) on gut microbiota across host phylogeny and geographical areas. In general agreement with our hypothesis, analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that radiation exposure alters the gut microbiota composition and structure in three of the four species of Apodemus mice. The notable lack of an association between the gut microbiota and soil radionuclide contamination in one mouse species from Fukushima (A. argenteus) probably reflects host “radiation escape” through its unique tree-dwelling lifestyle. The finding that host ecology can modulate effects of radiation exposure offers an interesting counterpoint for future analyses into effects of radiation or any other toxic exposure on host and its associated microbiota. Our data show that exposure to radionuclide contamination is linked to comparable gut microbiota responses across multiple species of rodents. © 2021 The Authors.

"Gut Microbiomes of Endangered Przewalski’s Horse Populations in Short- and Long-Term Captivity: Implication for Species Reintroduction Based on the Soft-Release Strategy","Tang L, Li Y, Srivathsan A, Gao Y, Li K, Hu D, Zhang D",2020,"Article","10.3389/fmicb.2020.00363","Captivity maybe the only choice for survival of many endangered vertebrates, and understanding its broad effects is important for animal management and conservation, including breeding endangered species for subsequent release. Extreme environmental changes during captivity may influence survival ability in the wild. Captivity decreases gut bacterial diversity in a wide range of animals. However, most studies directly compare animals living in captivity with those in the wild, and there is a lack of understanding of effects of gradient shift in lifestyle during species reintroduction based on the soft-release strategy, which involves a confinement period in a field enclosure. Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to analyze gut microbiomes of 11 captive and 12 semi-wild Przewalski’s horses (PH; Equus ferus przewalskii) under the same captivity environment, using fecal samples. A subset of samples with abundant extracted DNA (including 3 captive and 3 semi-wild individuals) was selected for whole-genome shotgun sequencing. We found that community diversity did not differ between the semi-wild PH and captive PH, but the semi-wild PH had significantly higher bacterial richness than those in captivity. Relative abundances of all dominant phyla were similar across the semi-wild or captive horses, while those of the non-dominant phyla Tenericutes and Proteobacteria were significantly higher in semi-wild PH than in captive PH. Beta diversity results indicated that bacterial communities of captives and semi-wild horses were clearly separated distinct when considering only composition. Functional profiling of the microbiomes revealed that the semi-wild and captive gut microbiomes were largely similar. However, semi-wild horse microbiomes had higher abundance of bacterial genes related to core metabolic processes, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleic acid metabolism. The study revealed that semi-wild PH could retain specific non-dominant bacteria and harbor a more diverse microbiome than the captive counterpart, and thus have higher metabolic potential to utilize the complex plants efficiently. These results indicate that change in host lifestyle may play a role in microbiome differentiation in the process of reintroduction, suggesting that a short period of time in captivity is acceptable for PH from the perspective of maintaining the richness of intestinal bacterial flora to some extent. © Copyright © 2020 Tang, Li, Srivathsan, Gao, Li, Hu and Zhang.","captivity effects; comparative study; fecal samples; gut microbiome; przewalski’s horse; soft-release; antiinfective agent; polyketide; rna 16s; terpenoid; amino acid metabolism; amplicon; anaeroplasma; article; bacterial gene; bacteroidetes; carbohydrate metabolism; carbohydrate transport; catabolism; cell death; cell growth; comparative study; controlled study; cyanobacterium; dna extraction; dna repair; dna replication; drug resistance; endangered species; energy conversion; energy yield; feces analysis; fibrobacteres; firmicutes; intestine flora; lachnospiraceae; lipid metabolism; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; mollicutes; nonhuman; nucleic acid metabolism; population abundance; prevotella; proteobacteria; przewalski's horse; rna sequencing; rna translation; ruminococcus; secondary metabolism; shotgun sequencing; signal transduction; species composition; species reintroduction; species richness; verrucomicrobia; whole genome sequencing"
"Using movement ecology to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple human-wildlife conflict management practices","Pekarsky S, Schiffner I, Markin Y, Nathan R",2021,"Article","10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109306","Human-wildlife conflicts are universally growing, threatening sustainable coexistence and demanding increasing conservation efforts. While such conflicts are commonly tackled by combining different management practices, how each component contributes to management effectiveness usually remains unclear. This challenge can be addressed by integrating individual-based movement ecology with detailed information on the variety of management practices applied. Using a high-resolution movement dataset of common cranes (Grus grus) wintering at the agricultural landscape of the Hula Valley (Israel), we assessed their individual-level responses to three conflict management activities – intensive scaring, allocation of refuge areas and diversionary feeding – quantified in space and time throughout the wintering period. We found that diversionary feeding combined with active scaring reduced the cranes' core activity area and led to a significant shift in habitat preference. Low refuge area availability combined with low intensity diversionary feeding required compensation by higher scaring efforts. However, even intensive feeding was insufficient to prevent cranes from foraging on sensitive crops when refuge fields were highly limited. While most cranes heavily relied on the feeding station, a smaller group consistently avoided it and relied on refuge areas and sensitive crops despite scaring efforts. To achieve a more balanced management plan in our case study, provisioning of diversionary food should be much lower, and refuge areas should be designated based on crane habitat selection rather than solely on residual crops. Generally, we stress that quantitative behavioral analysis of target species that incorporates sub-populations with consistent behavioral variation, is important for effective combination of multiple management practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","common crane; disturbance; diversionary feeding; human-wildlife coexistence; refuge areas; scaring; agricultural land; bird; coexistence; compensation; conflict management; data set; foraging behavior; habitat selection; movement; refuge; wildlife management; hula valley; israel; northern district; gruidae; grus grus"

We have analyzed its production in human tissues using a comprehensive microarray database. Its highest expression is in the salivary gland, indicating that it is an important component of saliva. It is also expressed in the trachea, bronchus, and in the mammary gland upon onset of lactation. We have also characterized a Ccl28 -/- mouse that exhibits very low IgA levels in milk, and the IgA levels in feces are also reduced. These observations confirm a role for the CCL28/CCR10 chemokine axis in the recruitment of IgA plasmablasts to the lactating mammary gland. CCL28 is also expressed in the vomeronasal organ. We also detected olfactory defects (anosmia) in a Ccl28 -/- mouse suggesting that CCL28 is involved in the function/development of olfaction. Importantly, Ccl28 -/- mice are highly susceptible to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in an acute model of infection, indicating that CCL28 plays a major role in innate immunity against Salmonella in the gut. Finally, microbiome studies revealed modest differences in the gut microbiota between Ccl28 -/- mice and their cohoused wild-type littermates. The latter observation suggests that under homeostatic conditions, CCL28 plays a limited role in shaping the gut microbiome. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","chemokines; gut; innate immunity; salmonella; vomeronasal organ; ccl28 chemokine; chemokine; chemokine receptor ccr10; immunoglobulin a; unclassified drug; beta chemokine; ccl28 protein, mouse; immunoglobulin a; adaptive immunity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anosmia; article; colony forming unit; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; host resistance; human; human tissue; infection resistance; innate immunity; intestine flora; intestine infection; male; mammary gland; mouse; mucosal immunity; nasal tissue; nonhuman; plasmablast; priority journal; salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium; salmonellosis; smelling; vomeronasal organ; animal; animal salmonellosis; c57bl mouse; homeostasis; immunology; innate immunity; knockout mouse; microbiology; mucosal immunity; odor; physiology; salmonella enterica; adaptive immunity; animals; chemokines, cc; gastrointestinal microbiome; homeostasis; immunity, innate; immunity, mucosal; immunoglobulin a; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; salmonella enterica; salmonella infections, animal; smell"
"Diet Versus Phylogeny: a Comparison of Gut Microbiota in Captive Colobine Monkey Species","Hale VL, Tan CL, Niu K, Yang Y, Knight R, Zhang Q, Cui D, Amato KR",2018,"Article","10.1007/s00248-017-1041-8","Both diet and host phylogeny shape the gut microbial community, and separating out the effects of these variables can be challenging. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to evaluate the impact of diet and phylogeny on the gut microbiota of nine colobine monkey species (N = 64 individuals). Colobines are leaf-eating monkeys that fare poorly in captivity—often exhibiting gastrointestinal (GI) problems. This study included eight Asian colobines (Rhinopithecus brelichi, Rhinopithecus roxellana, Rhinopithecus bieti, Pygathrix nemaeus, Nasalis larvatus, Trachypithecus francoisi, Trachypithecus auratus, and Trachypithecus vetulus) and one African colobine (Colobus guereza). Monkeys were housed at five different captive institutes: Panxi Wildlife Rescue Center (Guizhou, China), Beijing Zoo, Beijing Zoo Breeding Center, Singapore Zoo, and Singapore Zoo Primate Conservation Breeding Center. Captive diets varied widely between institutions, but within an institution, all colobine monkey species were fed nearly identical or identical diets. In addition, four monkey species were present at multiple captive institutes. This allowed us to parse the effects of diet and phylogeny in these captive colobines. Gut microbial communities clustered weakly by host species and strongly by diet, and overall, colobine phylogenetic relationships were not reflected in gut microbiota analyses.

"Transcriptome profiling of immune tissues reveals habitat-specific gene expression between lake and river sticklebacks","Huang Y, Chain FJJ, Panchal M, Eizaguirre C, Kalbe M, Lenz TL, Samonte IE, Stoll M, Bornberg-Bauer E, Reusch TBH, Milinski M, Feulner PGD",2016,"Article","10.1111/mec.13520","The observation of habitat-specific phenotypes suggests the action of natural selection. The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has repeatedly colonized and adapted to diverse freshwater habitats across the northern hemisphere since the last glaciation, while giving rise to recurring phenotypes associated with specific habitats. Parapatric lake and river populations of sticklebacks harbour distinct parasite communities, a factor proposed to contribute to adaptive differentiation between these ecotypes. However, little is known about the transcriptional response to the distinct parasite pressure of those fish in a natural setting. Here, we sampled wild-caught sticklebacks across four geographical locations from lake and river habitats differing in their parasite load. We compared gene expression profiles between lake and river populations using 77 whole-transcriptome libraries from two immune-relevant tissues, the head kidney and the spleen. Differential expression analyses revealed 139 genes with habitat-specific expression patterns across the sampled population pairs. Among the 139 differentially expressed genes, eight are annotated with an immune function and 42 have been identified as differentially expressed in previous experimental studies in which fish have been immune challenged. Together, these findings reinforce the hypothesis that parasites contribute to adaptation of sticklebacks in lake and river habitats. © 2016 The Authors.

"Inhibition by antibiotics of the bacterial response to long‐term starvation of Salmonella typhimurium and the colon microbiota of mice","Stenström T‐A, Conway P, Kjelleberg S",1989,"Article","10.1111/j.1365-2672.1989.tb04954.x","The number of viable cells of two strains of Salmonella typhimurium and the number of viable cells and the cell size of the colon microbiota of mice were examined during non‐growing conditions after exposure to antibiotics with known modes of action. Salmonella typhimurium starved for 1, 2, 4, 5, 12 and 20 d in a phosphate buffer saline solution and subsequently exposed for 2 and 6 h showed the following characteristics. The protein synthesis inhibitors gentamicin and tetracycline, the RNA synthesis inhibitor rifampicin and the membrane potential inhibitor polymyxin all impaired survival of starved cells. The reduction in the number of viable cells caused by the addition of gentamicin, rifampicin and polymyxin was generally more pronounced with extended exposure to energy and nutrient deprivation. Both 2‐ and 6‐h exposure of tetracycline, however, had diminishing inhibitory effects after 20 d compared with 5 d of starvation. Control experiments to verify non‐growing conditions in the starvation regime showed that DNA and cell wall synthesis inhibitors had no inhibitory effect after 24‐h starvation. The rough mutant strain displayed a lower sensitivity to a hydrophobic rather than a hydrophilic inhibitor as compared to the smooth wild‐type strain. The cell size reduction but not viability was partly prevented by protein synthesis inhibitors as seen for both in vivo and in vitro colon microbiota studies. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

As such, we have studied the impact of HII exposure on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, pancreatic islet morphology, muscle GLUT4 and plasma insulin and corticosterone levels. Normal and glucose intolerant wild-type Wistar rats were randomly divided in two groups: one group not exposed to HII and the other continuously exposed to HII. Animals were sacrificed at three timepoints of exposure (1, 6 or 12 weeks). An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed, blood samples were collected and the pancreas and the quadriceps femoris muscle were excised. Circulating insulin and corticosterone levels were determined and pancreatic and muscular tissue were routinely processed for histochemistry and immunohistochemistry with an anti-GLUT4 antibody. Animals exposed to HII had higher corticosterone levels than animals not exposed. No differences were found on insulin concerning HII exposure or glucose intolerance. Glucose intolerant animals had pancreatic islet fibrosis and no differences were found in GLUT4 ratio concerning HII exposure. In conclusion, we found that continuous exposure to HII increases stress hormone levels without inducing glucose intolerance in rats. © 2021, The Author(s).","; "
"Carryover effects minimized the positive effects of treated wastewater on anuran development","Zeitler EF, Cecala KK, McGrath DA",2021,"Article","10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112571","Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a potential solution for wastewater treatment due to their capacity to support native species and provide tertiary wastewater treatment. However, CWs can expose wildlife communities to excess nutrients and harmful contaminants, affecting their development, morphology, and behavior. To examine how wastewater CWs may affect wildlife, we raised Southern leopard frogs, Lithobates sphenocephalus, in wastewater from conventional secondary lagoon and tertiary CW treatments for comparison with pondwater along with the presence and absence of a common plant invader to these systems – common duckweed (Lemna minor) - and monitored their juvenile development for potential carryover effects into the terrestrial environment. The tertiary CW treatment did not change demographic or morphological outcomes relative to conventional wastewater treatment in our study. Individuals emerging from both wastewater treatments demonstrated lower terrestrial survival rates than those emerging from pondwater throughout the experiment though experiment-wide survival rates were equivalent among treatments. Individuals from wastewater treatments transformed at larger sizes relative to those in pondwater, but this advantage was minimized in the terrestrial environment. Individuals that developed with duckweed had consistent but marginally better performance in both environments. Our results suggest a potential trade-off between short-term benefits of development in treated effluent and long-term consequences on overall fitness. Overall, we demonstrate that CWs for the purpose of wastewater treatment may not be suitable replicates for wildlife habitat and could have consequences for local population dynamics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","amphibian; common duckweed; constructed wetland; contaminants; effluent; pharmaceuticals; wetland; wildlife; biological development; comparative study; constructed wetland; experimental study; fitness; frog; juvenile; pollution effect; survival; wastewater treatment; adult; animal experiment; article; constructed wetland; controlled study; demography; effluent; female; habitat; juvenile; lagoon; lemna minor; male; nonhuman; population dynamics; rana sphenocephala; survival rate; waste water management; wildlife; animal; anura; ecosystem; human; sewage; wastewater; water management; wetland; amphibia; lemna minor; lithobates; panthera pardus; animals; anura; ecosystem; humans; waste disposal, fluid; waste water; water purification; wetlands"
"Bacterial Communities in Central European Bumblebees: Low Diversity and High Specificity","Koch H, Schmid-Hempel P",2011,"Article","10.1007/s00248-011-9854-3","Recent studies on the microbial flora of the honeybee gut have revealed an apparently highly specific community of resident bacteria that might play a role in immune defence and food preservation for their hosts. However, at present, very little is known about the diversity and ecology of bacteria occurring in non-domesticated bees like bumblebees, which are of similar importance as honeybees for the pollination of agricultural and wild flowers. To fill this gap in knowledge, we examined six of the most common bumblebee species in Central Europe from three locations in Germany and Switzerland for their bacterial communities. We used a culture-independent molecular approach based on sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from a selection of individuals and examining a larger number of samples by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles. The gut flora was dominated by very few and mostly undescribed groups of bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. This core set of bacteria was present in all of the examined bumblebee species. These bacteria are similar to, but distinct from, bacteria previously described from the honeybee gut. Significant differences were observed between the communities of bacteria in the different bumblebee species; the effect of sampling location was less strong. A novel group of Betaproteobacteria additionally shows evidence for host species-specific genotypes. The gut flora of bumblebees therefore is apparently composed of relatively few highly specialized bacteria, indicating a strong interaction and possibly important functions with their hosts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","; animal; article; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; bee; classification; genetic variability; genetics; germany; host range; isolation and purification; microbiology; molecular genetics; phylogeny; restriction fragment length polymorphism; switzerland; animals; bacteria; bacterial physiological phenomena; bees; genetic variation; germany; host specificity; molecular sequence data; phylogeny; polymorphism, restriction fragment length; switzerland; actinobacteria; apis mellifera; apoidea; bacteria (microorganisms); bacteroidetes; betaproteobacteria; firmicutes; proteobacteria"

Although T6SS gene loci have been discovered in Cronobacter species, one of the major opportunistic foodborne pathogens, its function has not been elucidated. In this study, the roles of two phylogenetically distinct T6SS gene clusters in Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC12868 were investigated. Analysis of 138 genome sequences of C. sakazakii strains, we found that one T6SS gene cluster (T6SS-1) was ubiquitous in all examined strains, whereas another (T6SS-2) was absent or degenerated in a large proportion of the strains (n = 97). In addition, we confirmed the T6SS-1 antibacterial function through an in-frame deletion in the vasK and hcp genes. Compared with the wild-type strain, the T6SS-2-deficient mutant presented a much stronger colonization of organs when infecting neonatal rats. Thus, we proposed that T6SS-2 plays a role in pathogenic processes. This is the first study to investigate the functions of T6SS in C. sakazakii, and the results will extend our understanding of the pathogenic and phylogenetic characteristics of C. sakazakii. © 2018 Departamento de Enfermagem/Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo.

"A Subset of Polysaccharide Capsules in the Human Symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Promote Increased Competitive Fitness in the Mouse Gut","Porter NT, Canales P, Peterson DA, Martens EC",2017,"Article","10.1016/j.chom.2017.08.020","Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) play multiple roles in protecting bacteria from host and environmental factors, and many commensal bacteria can produce multiple capsule types. To better understand the roles of different CPSs in competitive intestinal colonization, we individually expressed the eight different capsules of the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Certain CPSs were most advantageous in vivo, and increased anti-CPS immunoglobulin A correlated with increased fitness of a strain expressing one particular capsule, CPS5, suggesting that it promotes avoidance of adaptive immunity. A strain with the ability to switch between multiple capsules was more competitive than those expressing any single capsule except CPS5. After antibiotic perturbation, only the wild-type, capsule-switching strain remained in the gut, shifting to prominent expression of CPS5 only in mice with intact adaptive immunity. These data suggest that different capsules equip mutualistic gut bacteria with the ability to thrive in various niches, including those influenced by immune responses and antibiotic perturbations. Symbiotic Bacteroides species encode for multiple capsular polysaccharides, the roles of which have remained poorly defined. Porter et al. identify one capsule involved in competitive colonization of the mouse gut that assists in evading adaptive immune responses.

"Salmonella Typhimurium strain ATCC14028 requires H2-hydrogenases for growth in the gut, but not at systemic sites","Maier L, Barthel M, Stecher B, Maier RJ, Gunn JS, Hardt W-D",2014,"Article","10.1371/journal.pone.0110187","Salmonella enterica is a common cause of diarrhea. For eliciting disease, the pathogen has to colonize the gut lumen, a site colonized by the microbiota. This process/initial stage is incompletely understood. Recent work established that one particular strain, Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344, employs the hyb H2-hydrogenase for consuming microbiota-derived H2to support gut luminal pathogen growth: Protons from the H2-plitting reaction contribute to the proton gradient across the outer bacterial membrane which can be harvested for ATP production or for import of carbon sources. However, it remained unclear, if other Salmonella strains would use the same strategy. In particular, earlier work had left unanswered if strain ATCC14028 might use H2for growth at systemic sites. To clarify the role of the hydrogenases, it seems important to establish if H2is used at systemic sites or in the gut and if Salmonella strains may differ with respect to the host sites where they require H2in vivo. In order to resolve this, we constructed a strain lacking all three H2-hydrogenases of ATCC14028 (14028hyd3) and performed competitive infection experiments. Upon intragastric inoculation, 14028hyd3was present at 100-fold lower numbers than 14028WTin the stool and at systemic sites. In contrast, i.v. inoculation led to equivalent systemic loads of 14028hyd3and the wild type strain. However, the pathogen population spreading to the gut lumen featured again up to 100-fold attenuation of 14028hyd3. Therefore, ATCC14028 requires H2-hydrogenases for growth in the gut lumen and not at systemic sites. This extends previous work on ATCC14028 and supports the notion that H2-utilization might be a general feature of S.

Here, we controlled for these other confounding factors in our investigation of the magnitude of the effect of diet on the gut microbiome assemblies of nonpasserine birds. We collected fecal samples, at one point in time, from 35 species of birds in a single zoo as well as 6 species of domestic poultry from farms in Guangzhou city to minimize the influences from interfering factors. Specifically, we describe 16S rRNA amplicon data from 129 fecal samples obtained from 41 species of birds, with additional shotgun metagenomic sequencing data generated from 16 of these individuals. Our data show that diets containing native starch increase the abundance of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiome, while those containing plantderived fiber mainly enrich the level of Clostridium. Greater numbers of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria are detected in carnivorous birds, while in birds fed a commercial cornsoybean basal diet, a stronger inner-connected microbial community containing Clostridia and Bacteroidia was enriched. Furthermore, the metagenome functions of the microbes (such as lipid metabolism and amino acid synthesis) were adapted to the different food types to achieve a beneficial state for the host. In conclusion, the covariation of diet and gut microbiome identified in our study demonstrates a modulation of the gut microbiome by dietary diversity and helps us better understand how birds live based on dietmicrobiome-host interactions. Importance Our study identified food source, rather than host phylogeny, as the main factor modulating the gut microbiome diversity of nonpasserine birds, after minimizing the effects of other complex interfering factors such as weather, season, and geography. Adaptive evolution of microbes to food types formed a dietary-microbiomehost interaction reciprocal state. The covariation of diet and gut microbiome, including the response of microbiota assembly to diet in structure and function, is important for health and nutrition in animals. Our findings help resolve the major modulators of gut microbiome diversity in nonpasserine birds, which had not previously been well studied. The diet-microbe interactions and cooccurrence patterns identified in our study may be of special interest for future health assessment and conservation in birds. Copyright © 2021 Xiao et al.

An increasing number of studies show that captivity significantly affects the abundance and community structure of gut microbiota. The northern grass lizard (Takydromus septentrionalis) is an extensively studied lacertid lizard and has a distributional range covering the central and southeastern parts of China. Nonetheless, little is known about the gut microbiota of this species, which may play a certain role in nutrient and energy metabolism as well as immune homeostasis. Here, we examined the differences in the gut microbiota between two groups (wild and captive) of lizards through 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The results demonstrated that the dominant microbial components in both groups consisted of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes. The two groups did not differ in the abundance of these three phyla. Citrobacter was the most dominant genus in wild lizards, while Morganella was the most dominant genus in captive lizards. Moreover, gene function predictions showed that genes at the KEGG pathway levels2 were more abundant in wild lizards than in captive lizards but, at the KEGG pathway levels1, the differences in gene abundances between wild and captive lizards were not significant. In summary, captivity exerted a significant impact on the gut microbial community structure and diversity in T. septentrionalis, and future work could usefully investigate the causes of these changes using a comparative approach. © 2020 The Authors.

"Acquisition and structuring of midgut bacterial communities in gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) larvae","Mason CJ, Raffa KF",2014,"Article","10.1603/EN14031","Insects are associated with a diversity of bacteria that colonize their midguts. The extent to which these communities reflect maternal transmission, environmental acquisition, and subsequent structuring by the extreme conditions within the insect gut are poorly understood in many species. We used gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) as a model to investigate interactions between egg mass and environmental sources of bacteria on larval midgut communities. Egg masses were collected from several wild and laboratory populations, and the effects of diet, initial egg mass community, and internal host environment were evaluated using 454 16S-rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Wild populations were highly diverse, while laboratory-maintained egg masses were associated with few operational taxonomic units. As larvae developed, their midgut bacterial communities became more similar to each other and the consumed diet despite initial differences in egg mass-associated bacteria. Subsequent experiments revealed that while midgut membership was more similar to bacteria associated with diet than with egg mass-associated bacteria, we were unable to detect distinct, persistent differences attributable to specific host plants. The differences between foliar communities and midgut communities of larvae that ingested them were owing to relative changes in populations of several bacteria phylotypes. We conclude that gypsy moth has a relatively characteristic midgut bacterial community that is reflective of, but ultimately distinct from, its foliar diet. This work demonstrates that environmental acquisition of diverse microbes can lead to similar midgut bacterial assemblages, underscoring the importance of host physiological environment in structuring bacterial communities. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.","bacteria; community; midgut; plant-insect interaction; pyrosequencing; bacterium; biological control; colonization; community structure; host plant; larva; microbial community; moth; plant-insect interaction; species diversity; rna 16s; animal; bacteria; bacterial gene; bacterial phenomena and functions; diet; dna sequence; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; growth, development and aging; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; larva; microbiology; microflora; molecular genetics; moth; oocyte; polymerase chain reaction; animals; bacteria; bacterial physiological phenomena; diet; gastrointestinal tract; genes, bacterial; high-throughput nucleotide sequencing; larva; microbiota; molecular sequence data; moths; ovum; polymerase chain reaction; rna, ribosomal, 16s; sequence analysis, dna"
"Composition and energy harvesting capacity of the gut microbiota: Relationship to diet, obesity and time in mouse models","Murphy EF, Cotter PD, Healy S, Marques TM, O'Sullivan O, Fouhy F, Clarke SF, O'Toole PW, Quigley EM, Stanton C, Ross PR, O'Doherty RM, Shanahan F",2010,"Article","10.1136/gut.2010.215665","Background and Aims: Increased efficiency of energy harvest, due to alterations in the gut microbiota (increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes), has been implicated in obesity in mice and humans. However, a causal relationship is unproven and contributory variables include diet, genetics and age. Therefore, we explored the effect of a high-fat (HF) diet and genetically determined obesity (ob/ob) for changes in microbiota and energy harvesting capacity over time. Methods: Seven-week-old male ob/ob mice were fed a low-fat diet and wild-type mice were fed either a low-fat diet or a HF-diet for 8 weeks (n=8/group). They were assessed at 7, 11 and 15 weeks of age for: fat and lean body mass (by NMR); faecal and caecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA, by gas chromatography); faecal energy content (by bomb calorimetry) and microbial composition (by metagenomic pyrosequencing). Results: A progressive increase in Firmicutes was confirmed in both HF-fed and ob/ob mice reaching statistical significance in the former, but this phylum was unchanged over time in the lean controls. Reductions in Bacteroidetes were also found in ob/ob mice. However, changes in the microbiota were dissociated from markers of energy harvest. Thus, although the faecal energy in the ob/ob mice was significantly decreased at 7 weeks, and caecal SCFA increased, these did not persist and faecal acetate diminished over time in both ob/ob and HF-fed mice, but not in lean controls. Furthermore, the proportion of the major phyla did not correlate with energy harvest markers. Conclusion: The relationship between the microbial composition and energy harvesting capacity is more complex than previously considered. While compositional changes in the faecal microbiota were confirmed, this was primarily a feature of high-fat feeding rather than genetically induced obesity. In addition, changes in the proportions of the major phyla were unrelated to markers of energy harvest which changed over time.

"Inclusion of flagellin during vaccination against influenza enhances recall responses in nonhuman primate neonates","Kim JR, Holbrook BC, Hayward SL, Blevins LK, Jorgensen MJ, Kock ND, De Paris K, D'Agostino RB, Jr, Aycock ST, Mizel SB, Parks GD, Alexander-Miller MA",2015,"Article","10.1128/JVI.00549-15","Influenza virus can cause life-threatening infections in neonates and young infants. Although vaccination is a major countermeasure against influenza, current vaccines are not approved for use in infants less than 6 months of age, in part due to the weak immune response following vaccination. Thus, there is a strong need to develop new vaccines with improved efficacy for this vulnerable population. To address this issue, we established a neonatal African green monkey (AGM) nonhuman primate model that could be used to identify effective influenza vaccine approaches for use in young infants. We assessed the ability of flagellin, a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist, to serve as an effective adjuvant in this at-risk population. Four- to 6-day-old AGMs were primed and boosted with inactivated PR8 influenza virus (IPR8) adjuvanted with either wild-type flagellin or inactive flagellin with a mutation at position 229 (m229), the latter of which is incapable of signaling through TLR5. Increased IgG responses were observed following a boost, as well as at early times after challenge, in infants vaccinated with flagellin-adjuvanted IPR8. Inclusion of flagellin during vaccination also resulted in a significantly increased number of influenza virus-specific T cells following challenge compared to the number in infants vaccinated with the m229 adjuvant. Finally, following challenge infants vaccinated with IPR8 plus flagellin exhibited a reduced pathology in the lungs compared to that in infants that received IPR8 plus m229.

"Isolation and identification of culturable bacteria from wild Anopheles culicifacies, a first step in a paratransgenesis approach","Chavshin AR, Oshaghi MA, Vatandoost H, Pourmand MR, Raeisi A, Terenius O",2014,"Article","10.1186/1756-3305-7-419","Background: Due to the effect of midgut bacteria on proliferation of parasites and their potential as paratransgenesis tools, their identification in malaria vector mosquitoes is important. Anopheles culicifacies s.l. is one of the main malaria vectors in Asia; however, its midgut microbiota remains un-studied. This work was primarily designed to isolate potential candidates for use in a paratransgenesis approach, but also to give a picture of the midgut microbiota of wild-caught An. culicifacies larvae and adults from the southeast corner of Iran, which has the highest malaria endemicity in the country.Methods. A total of 68 larvae and 34 adult females (newly eclosed and older) from three different biotopes in Iran were analyzed for their midgut microflora. The mosquitoes had their midgut bacterial contents plated on three different culture media (brain heart agar, nutrient agar and blood agar) yielding 57 bacterial isolates. The 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were sequence analyzed for species designation, which then was confirmed by biochemical analysis.Results: A total of twelve bacterial genera were identified: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Chryseobacterium, Delftia, Exiguobacterium, Kurthia, Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Thorsellia and Variovorax. In older females, only Gram-negative bacteria were found, whereas larvae and newly-eclosed adults also harbored Gram-positive bacteria. The diversity of isolates also varied between sampling sites and mosquito stages, with the largest number of genera found in the Anguri district and in larvae, respectively. Pseudomonas was the most common genus retrieved from all sampling sites, and in both larvae and adults, suggesting a potential transstadial passage of these bacteria. Interestingly, identical 16S sequences of Pseudomonas were found in mosquitoes originating from different habitats at least 45 km apart, which could suggest that these bacteria have been adapted to the mosquitoes.Conclusions: The study of vector mosquito microbiota has recently gathered increased interest because of the potential influence on vector competence. By adding data from a hitherto uncharacterized malaria mosquito, a better picture of gut flora in vector mosquitoes was obtained. Furthermore, some species of the predominant genus Pseudomonas will be evaluated for the selection of a paratransgenesis candidate. © 2014 Chavshin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","16s rrna; anopheles culicifacies; malaria; midgut microbiota; paratransgenesis; agar; rna 16s; bacterial dna; acinetobacter; adult; aeromonas; anopheles culicifacies; arthropod larva; article; bacillus; bacterium; bacterium identification; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; biotope; blood; brain; chemical analysis; chryseobacterium; culture medium; delftia; endemic disease; exiguobacterium; female; gene sequence; habitat; heart; intestine flora; iran; kurthia; malaria; microbacterium; microbial diversity; midgut; nonhuman; nutrient; pseudomonas; sequence analysis; staphylococcus; thorsellia; transgenics; variovorax; animal; anopheles; bacterium; bacterium identification; biodiversity; classification; digestive system; disease carrier; genetics; isolation and purification; larva; microbiology; phylogeny; transmission; acinetobacter; aeromonas; anopheles culicifacies; anopheles culicifacies a; bacillus (bacterium); bacteria (microorganisms); chryseobacterium; delftia; exiguobacterium; kurthia; microbacterium; negibacteria; posibacteria; pseudomonas; staphylococcus; thorsellia; variovorax; animals; anopheles; bacteria; bacterial typing techniques; biodiversity; digestive system; dna, bacterial; female; insect vectors; larva; malaria; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal, 16s"

With Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) being a singlestranded RNA virus, and the recent evidence that the NOD2 target, NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) is of importance in the pathogenesis of CVB3-induced myocarditis, we aimed to unravel the role of NOD2 in CVB3-induced myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endomyocardial biopsy NOD2 mRNA expression was higher in CVB3-positive patients compared with patients with myocarditis but without evidence of persistent CVB3 infection. Left ventricular NOD2 mRNA expression was also induced in CVB3-induced myocarditis versus healthy control mice. NOD2 knockdown(./.) mice were rescued from the detrimental CVB3-mediated effects as shown by a reduced cardiac inflammation (less cardiac infiltrates and suppression of proinflammatory cytokines), cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, lower CAR (Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor) expression and CVB3 copy number, and an improved left ventricular function in NOD2-/- CVB3 mice compared with wild-type CVB3 mice. In agreement, NOD2-/- decreased the CVB3-induced inflammatory response, CVB3 copy number, and apoptosis in vitro. NOD2-/- was further associated with a reduction in CVB3-induced NLRP3 expression and activity as evidenced by lower ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) expression, caspase 1 activity, or IL-1β (interleukin-1β) protein expression under in vivo and in vitro CVB3 conditions.

"Reduced Nogo expression inhibits diet-induced metabolic disorders by regulating ChREBP and insulin activity","Zhang S, Guo F, Yu M, Yang X, Yao Z, Li Q, Wei Z, Feng K, Zeng P, Zhao D, Li X, Zhu Y, Miao QR, Iwakiri Y, Chen Y, Han J, Duan Y",2020,"Article","10.1016/j.jhep.2020.07.034","Background &amp; Aims: Chronic overconsumption of a high-carbohydrate diet leads to steatosis and its associated metabolic disorder and, eventually, to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and insulin regulate de novo lipogenesis from glucose. Herein, we studied the effect of reticulon-4 (Nogo) expression on diet-induced metabolic disorders in mice. Methods: Nogo-deficient (Nogo−/−) and littermate control [wild-type (WT)] mice were fed a high-glucose or high-fructose diet (HGD/HFrD) to induce metabolic disorders. The effects of Nogo small interfering (si) RNA (siRNA) on HFrD-induced metabolic disorders were investigated in C57BL/6J mice. Results: HGD/HFrD induced steatosis and its associated metabolic disorders in WT mice by activating ChREBP and impairing insulin sensitivity. They also activated Nogo-B expression, which in turn inhibited insulin activity. In response to HGD/HFrD feeding, Nogo deficiency enhanced insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism to reduce the expression of ChREBP and lipogenic molecules, activated AMP-activated catalytic subunit α, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α and fibroblast growth factor 21, and reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation, thereby blocking HGD/HFrD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders. Injection of Nogo siRNA protected C57BL/6J mice against HFrD-induced metabolic disorders by ameliorating insulin sensitivity, ChREBP activity, ER stress and inflammation. Conclusions: Our study identified Nogo as an important mediator of insulin sensitivity and ChREBP activity. Reduction of Nogo expression is a potential strategy for the treatment of high-carbohydrate diet-induced metabolic complications. Lay summary: Nogo deficiency blocks high-carbohydrate diet-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, while increasing glucose/lipid utilisation and energy expenditure. Thus, reduction of Nogo expression protects against high-carbohydrate diet-induced body-weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and the associated metabolic disorders, indicating that approaches inhibiting Nogo expression can be applied for the treatment of diseases associated with metabolic disorders. © 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver","chrebp; energy metabolism; insulin sensitivity; lipogenesis; nogo; carbohydrate responsive element binding protein; fibroblast growth factor 21; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase kinase; insulin; nucleic acid binding protein; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; protein nogo; small interfering rna; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; diet; endoplasmic reticulum stress; energy metabolism; fatty liver; feeding; high-fructose diet; high-glucose diet; inflammation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid liver level; male; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression level"

Lithocholic acid, a bile acid produced by intestinal bacteria, is an agonist of vitamin D receptor. However, its effects on phosphate/calcium homeostasis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that lithocholic acid increases intestinal phosphate/calcium absorption in an enterocyte vitamin D receptor-dependent manner. Lithocholic acid was found to increase serum phosphate/calcium levels and thus to exacerbate vascular calcification in animals with chronic kidney disease. Lithocholic acid did not affect levels of intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2b, Pi transporter-1, -2, or transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6. Everted gut sac analyses demonstrated that lithocholic acid increased phosphate/calcium absorption in a transcellular pathway-independent manner. Lithocholic acid suppressed intestinal mucosal claudin 3 and occludin in wild-type mice, but not in vitamin D receptor knockout mice. Everted gut sacs of claudin 3 knockout mice showed an increased permeability for phosphate, but not calcium. In patients with chronic kidney disease, serum 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D levels are decreased, probably as an intrinsic adjustment to reduce phosphate/calcium burden. In contrast, serum and fecal lithocholic acid levels and fecal levels of bile acid 7α-dehydratase, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in lithocholic acid production, were not downregulated. The effects of lithocholic acid were eliminated by bile acid adsorptive resin in mice.

"Mouse Paneth cell antimicrobial function is independent of Nod2","Shanahan MT, Carroll IM, Grossniklaus E, White A, Von Furstenberg RJ, Barner R, Fodor AA, Henning SJ, Sartor RB, Gulati AS",2014,"Article","10.1136/gutjnl-2012-304190","Objective: Although polymorphisms of the NOD2 gene predispose to the development of ileal Crohn's disease, the precise mechanisms of this increased susceptibility remain unclear. Previous work has shown that transcript expression of the Paneth cell (PC) antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) α-defensin 4 and α-defensin-related sequence 10 are selectively decreased in Nod2-/- mice. However, the specific mouse background used in this previous study is unclear. In light of recent evidence suggesting that mouse strain strongly influences PC antimicrobial activity, we sought to characterise PC AMP function in commercially available Nod2-/- mice on a C57BL/6 (B6) background. Specifically, we hypothesised that Nod2 -/- B6 mice would display reduced AMP expression and activity. Design: Wild-type (WT) and Nod2-/- B6 ileal AMP expression was assessed via real-time PCR, acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. PCs were enumerated using flow cytometry. Functionally, α-defensin bactericidal activity was evaluated using a gel-overlay antimicrobial assay. Faecal microbial composition was determined using 454-sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene in cohoused WT and Nod2-/- littermates. Results: WT and Nod2-/- B6 mice displayed similar PC AMP expression patterns, equivalent α-defensin profiles, and identical antimicrobial activity against commensal and pathogenic bacterial strains. Furthermore, minimal differences in gut microbial composition were detected between the two cohoused, littermate mouse groups. Conclusions: Our data reveal that Nod2 does not directly regulate PC antimicrobial activity in B6 mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that previously reported Nod2-dependent influences on gut microbial composition may be overcome by environmental factors, such as cohousing with WT littermates.","; alpha defensin; angiogenin 4; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; cryptidin related sequence peptide; polypeptide antibiotic agent; regenerating islet derived protein 3 gamma; unclassified drug; urea; 16s gene; ang4 gene; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antimicrobial activity; article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bactericidal activity; c57bl 6 mouse; cell count; controlled study; crohn disease; defa20 gene; defa3 gene; defa4 gene; defa5 gene; feces composition; flow cytometry; gene deletion; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic polymorphism; intestine flora; mass spectrometry; microbiology; mouse; nod2 gene; nonhuman; paneth cell; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; real time polymerase chain reaction; species composition; bacterial interactions; crohn's disease; ibd - genetics; inflammatory bowel disease; intestinal epithelium; alpha-defensins; animals; antigens, neoplasm; defensins; escherichia coli; feces; ileum; lectins, c-type; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; microbial sensitivity tests; muramidase; nod2 signaling adaptor protein; paneth cells; peptides; protein precursors; ribonuclease, pancreatic; rna, messenger; salmonella enterica; transcription, genetic; tumor markers, biological"

This research aimed to investigate the possibility of using Plasmodium parasite as a novel vaccine vector for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) immunotherapy. We constructed a Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL strain (P.y) expressing murine glypican-3 (GPC3) protein (P.y-GPC3), and examined its therapeutic potency in a murine Hepa1-6-induced hepatoma model that highly expressed GPC3 protein. The prerequisites for invoking a CD8+ T cell response were assessed after P.ybased immunization, which included obviously increased concentrations of T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-associated cytokines, such as IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α, in serum and preferential expansion of the CD8α+ dendritic cell (DC) subset with higher expression of CD80 and CD86 molecules. Compared with uninfected and wild-type P.y-infected mice, a significant GPC3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response was detected in P.y-GPC3 vaccinated mice. Furthermore, P.y-GPC3-based vaccination dramatically inhibited Hepa1-6-induced tumor growth in the implanted HCC and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. We concluded that a Plasmodium-based vector is highly efficient in inducing tumor antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity and protection against tumor cells. More broadly, this strategy supported our hypothesis that Plasmodium parasites, as novel therapeutic antigen vectors, may be applicable to tumor immunotherapy for patients with HCC.","gpc3; hepatocellular carcinoma; immunotherapy; plasmodium parasite; vector; b7 antigen; cancer vaccine; cd86 antigen; gamma interferon; glypican 3; interleukin 2; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cancer immunization; cancer immunotherapy; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; cd8+ t lymphocyte; cell expansion; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cytotoxic t lymphocyte; dendritic cell; drug potency; female; immune response; in vivo study; innate immunity; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; parasite vector; plasmodium; plasmodium yoelii; protein expression; th1 cell; wild type"
"Microbiome affects egg carotenoid investment, nestling development and adult oxidative costs of reproduction in Great tits","Jacob S, Parthuisot N, Vallat A, Ramon-Portugal F, Helfenstein F, Heeb P",2015,"Article","10.1111/1365-2435.12404","Parasites influence allocation trade-offs between reproduction and self-maintenance and consequently shape host life-history traits. The host microbiome includes pathogenic and commensal micro-organisms that are remarkable in their diversity and ubiquity. However, experimental studies investigating whether the microbiome shapes host reproduction are still lacking. In this study, we tested whether the microbiome affects three important components of bird reproduction, namely (i) the maternal transfer of anti-microbial compounds to the eggs, (ii) the development of nestlings and (iii) the trade-off between reproduction and self-maintenance, here measured by the oxidative costs of reproduction. We experimentally modified the microbiome of wild breeding Great tits (Parus major) by spraying nests with liquid solution that either favoured or inhibited bacterial growth compared to a control. These treatments modified the bacterial communities in the nests and on adult feathers. We found that females from the treatment that decreased bacterial densities in the nests laid eggs with less carotenoids than females from the control, while we found no significant effect of increasing bacterial densities and modifying community composition compared to the control. Nestlings exposed to decreased bacterial densities grew faster and had longer tarsus length at fledging. Moreover, our analyses revealed that the relationship between investment in reproduction and oxidative damage was affected by the treatments. Adults raising larger clutches suffered higher oxidative damage in control nests, whereas this oxidative cost of reproduction was not detected when we modified bird microbiome. Our study provides experimental evidence for an effect of the microbiome on egg carotenoid investment, nestling development and oxidative cost of reproduction and thus highlights the major effect that the microbiome may have on the evolution of host life-history strategies. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","life-history traits; maternal effects; microbial communities; nestling growth; oxidative stress; biological development; breeding population; carotenoid; community composition; growth response; life history trait; maternal effect; microbial community; nestling; oxidation; passerine; reproductive cost; aves; bacteria (microorganisms); parus major"

Here we use ancient DNA extraction methods, shotgun library preparation, and next generation Illumina sequencing to examine oral microbiota from 19 dental calculus samples recovered from wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) who died in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. The resulting sequences were trimmed for quality, analyzed using MALT, MEGAN, and alignment scripts, and integrated with previously published dental calculus microbiome data. We report significant differences in oral microbiome phyla between chimpanzees and anatomically modern humans (AMH), with chimpanzees possessing a greater abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, and AMH showing higher Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Our results suggest that by using an enterotype clustering method, results cluster largely based on host species. These clusters are driven by Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium genera in chimpanzees and Haemophilus and Streptococcus in AMH. Additionally, we compare a nearly complete Porphyromonas gingivalis genome to previously published genomes recovered from human gingiva to gain perspective on evolutionary relationships across host species. Finally, using shotgun sequence data we assessed indicators of diet from DNA in calculus and suggest exercising caution when making assertions related to host lifestyle.

"Gene discovery and differential expression analysis of humoral immune response elements in female Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)","Nayduch D, Lee MB, Saski CA",2014,"Article","10.1186/1756-3305-7-388","Background: Female Culicoides sonorensis midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are vectors of pathogens that impact livestock and wildlife in the United States. Little is known about their biology on a molecular-genetic level, including components of their immune system. Because the insect immune response is involved with important processes such as gut microbial homeostasis and vector competence, our aims were to identify components of the midge innate immune system and examine their expression profiles in response to diet across time. Methods: In our previous work, we de novo sequenced and analyzed the transcriptional landscape of female midges under several feeding states including teneral (unfed) and early and late time points after blood and sucrose. Here, those transcriptomes were further analyzed to identify insect innate immune orthologs, particularly humoral immune response elements. Additionally, we examined immune gene expression profiles in response to diet over time, on both a transcriptome-wide, whole-midge level and more specifically via qRTPCR analysis of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression in the alimentary canal. Results: We identified functional units comprising the immune deficiency (Imd), Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, including humoral factors, transmembrane receptors, signaling components, transcription factors/regulators and effectors such as AMPs. Feeding altered the expression of receptors, regulators, AMPs, prophenoloxidase and thioester-containing proteins, where blood had a greater effect than sucrose on the expression profiles of most innate immune components. qRTPCR of AMP genes showed that all five were significantly upregulated in the alimentary canal after blood feeding, possibly in response to proliferating populations of gut bacteria. Conclusions: Identification and functional insight of humoral/innate immune components in female C. sonorensis updates our knowledge of the molecular biology of this important vector. Because diet alone influenced the expression of immune pathway components, including their effectors, subsequent study of the role of innate immunity in biological processes such as gut homeostasis and life history are being pursued. Furthermore, since the humoral response is a key contributor in gut immunity, manipulating immune gene expression will help in uncovering genetic components of vector competence, including midgut barriers to infection. The results of such studies will serve as a platform for designing novel transmission-blocking strategies. © 2014 Nayduch et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","attacin; biting midge; cecropin; defensin; imd; innate immunity; jak/stat; rnaseq; toll; humoral antibody; janus kinase; membrane receptor; monophenol monooxygenase; polypeptide antibiotic agent; prophenoloxidase; stat protein; sucrose; thioester; toll like receptor; transcription factor; unclassified drug; insect protein; transcriptome; article; blood; culicoides; culicoides sonorensis; digestive system; feeding; gene expression; humoral immunity; immune deficiency; innate immunity; intestine flora; nonhuman; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; upregulation; amino acid sequence; animal; ceratopogonidae; female; gene expression regulation; genetic association; genetics; humoral immunity; immunology; metabolism; molecular genetics; amino acid sequence; animals; ceratopogonidae; female; gene expression regulation; genetic association studies; immunity, humoral; insect proteins; molecular sequence data; signal transduction; transcriptome"

In contrast to HCl-acidified water, H2SO4-acidified water only temporarily impaired the pole-descending ability of mice (at 3 months of age), and did not change the performance in an accelerating rotarod test. As compared to 129S6/SvEv mice receiving non-acidified or HCl-acidified drinking water, the gut microbiota of 129S6/SvEv mice on H2SO4-acidified water displayed significant alterations at every taxonomic level especially at 6 months of age. Our results demonstrate that the effects of acidified drinking water on the behavior and gut microbiota of 129S6/SvEv mice depends on the acid used for acidification.

We examined the diversity of wild-caught black blow fly endogenous (internal body) and exogenous (external body) microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, 27 phyla, 171 families and 533 genera were detected, and diversity was significantly higher (P < 0.05) on external body surfaces. At the genus level, Dysgonomonas, Ignatzschineria, Acinetobacter, Vagococcus, Myroides, and Wohlfahrtiimonas were predominant. Cloning and sequencing of nearly full-length fragments of the 16S rRNA gene showed that some of the species identified are known to be pathogenic to humans, animals, and plants. Myroides odoratimimus and Acinetobacter radioresistens are well-known, multi-drug resistant bacteria.

"Lack of statistical power as a major limitation in understanding MHC-mediated immunocompetence in wild vertebrate populations","Gaigher A, Burri R, San-Jose LM, Roulin A, Fumagalli L",2019,"Article","10.1111/mec.15276","Disentangling the sources of variation in developing an effective immune response against pathogens is of major interest to immunoecology and evolutionary biology. To date, the link between immunocompetence and genetic variation at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has received little attention in wild animals, despite the key role of MHC genes in activating the adaptive immune system. Although several studies point to a link between MHC and immunocompetence, negative findings have also been reported. Such disparate findings suggest that limited statistical power might be affecting studies on this topic, owing to insufficient sample sizes and/or a generally small effect of MHC on the immunocompetence of wild vertebrates. To clarify this issue, we investigated the link between MHC variation and seven immunocompetence proxies in a large sample of barn owls and estimated the effect sizes and statistical power of this and published studies on this topic. We found that MHC poorly explained variation in immunocompetence of barn owls, with small-to-moderate associations between MHC and immunocompetence in owls (effect size:.1 ≥ r ≤.3) similar to other vertebrates studied to date. Such small-to-moderate effects were largely associated with insufficient power, which was only sufficient (>0.8) to detect moderate-to-large effect sizes (r ≥.3). Thus, studies linking MHC variation with immunocompetence in wild populations are underpowered to detect MHC effects, which are likely to be of generally small magnitude. Larger sample sizes (>200) will be required to achieve sufficient power in future studies aiming to robustly test for a link between MHC variation and immunocompetence. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","birds; immunoecology; major histocompatibility complex; power analysis; adaptive immunity; allele; animal; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; immunocompetence; immunology; major histocompatibility complex; molecular evolution; owl; vertebrate; wild animal; adaptive immunity; alleles; animals; animals, wild; evolution, molecular; genetic variation; immunocompetence; major histocompatibility complex; selection, genetic; strigiformes; vertebrates"

C. jejuni is common in the gut of wild birds, and shows distinct strain-specific association to particular bird species. This contrasts with farm animals, in which several genotypes co-exist. It is unclear if the barriers restricting transmission between host species of such specialist strains are related to environmental factors such as contact between host species, bacterial survival in the environment, etc., or rather to strain specific adaptation to the intestinal environment of specific hosts. We compared colonization dynamics in vivo between two host-specific C. jejuni from a song thrush (ST-1304 complex) and a mallard (ST-995), and a generalist strain from chicken (ST-21 complex) in a wild host, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). In 18-days infection experiments, the song thrush strain showed only weak colonization and was cleared from all birds after 10 days, whereas both mallard and chicken strains remained stable. When the chicken strain was given 4 days prior to co-infection of the same birds with a mallard strain, it was rapidly outcompeted by the latter. In contrast, when the mallard strain was given 4 days prior to co-infection with the chicken strain, the mallard strain remained and expansion of the chicken strain was delayed. Our results suggest strain-specific differences in the ability of C. jejuni to colonize mallards, likely associated with host origin.

According to the natural selection theory, the contribution of non-genetic inheritance may be significant for the transmission of characters. If this theory is confirmed in livestock, not considering non-genetic means of transmission in selection schemes might prevent achieving maximum progress in the livestock populations being selected. The present discussion paper reviews the different mechanisms of genetic and non-genetic inheritance reported in the literature as occurring in livestock species. Non-genetic sources of inheritance comprise information transmitted via physical means, such as epigenetic and microbiota inheritance, and those transmitted via learning mechanisms: behavioral, cultural and ecological inheritance. In the first part of this paper we review the evidence that suggests that both genetic and non-genetic information contribute to inheritance in livestock (i.e. transmitted from one generation to the next and causing phenotypic differences between individuals) and discuss how the environment may influence non-genetic inherited factors. Then, in a second step, we consider methods for favoring the transmission of non-genetic inherited factors by estimating and selecting animals on their extended transmissible value and/or introducing favorable non-genetic factors via the animals’ environment. © 2019 David, Canario, Combes and Demars.","behavior; culture; epigenetic; genetic; livestock; microbiota; non-genetic inheritance; adult; article; epigenetics; inheritance; learning; livestock; microflora; nonhuman"
"Lord of the Diptera (and Moths and a Spider): Molecular Diet Analyses and Foraging Ecology of Indiana Bats in Illinois","O'Rourke DR, Mangan MT, Mangan KE, Bokulich NA, MacManes MD, Foster JT",2021,"Article","10.3389/fevo.2021.623655","Effective management of endangered or threatened wildlife requires an understanding of how foraging habitats are used by those populations. Molecular diet analysis of fecal samples offers a cost-effective and non-invasive method to investigate how diets of wild populations vary with respect to spatial and temporal factors. For the federally endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), documenting its preferred food sources can provide critical information to promote effective conservation of this federally endangered species. Using cytochrome oxidase I amplicon sequence data from Indiana bat guano samples collected at two roosting areas in Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge, we found that dipteran taxa (i.e., flies) associated with riparian habitats were the most frequently detected taxon and represented the majority of the sequence diversity among the arthropods sampled. A select few arthropods from other taxa—especially spiders—are also likely important to Indiana bat diets in this refuge. A supervised learning analysis of diet components suggest only a small fraction of the frequently detected taxa are important contributors to spatial and temporal variation. Overall, these data depict the Indiana bat as a generalist consumer whose diet includes some prey items associated with particular seasonal or spatial components, along with other taxa repeatedly consumed throughout the entire foraging season. These molecular diet analyses suggest that protecting foraging resources specifically associated with the riparian habitat of Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge is essential to promote effective Indiana bat conservation. © Copyright © 2021 O'Rourke, Mangan, Mangan, Bokulich, MacManes and Foster.","animal diets; bat diet; cytochrome oxidase; metabarcoding; myotis sodalis; "
"Determining Mhc-DRB profiles in wild populations of three congeneric true lemur species by noninvasive methods","de Winter II, Qurkhuli T, de Groot N, de Vos-Rouweler AJM, van Hooft P, Heitkönig IMA, Prins HHT, Bontrop RE, Doxiadis GGM",2019,"Article","10.1007/s00251-018-1085-z","The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic and polygenic genomic region that plays a crucial role in immune-related diseases. Given the need for comparative studies on the variability of immunologically important genes among wild populations and species, we investigated the allelic variation of MHC class II DRB among three congeneric true lemur species: the red-fronted lemur (Eulemur rufifrons), red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer), and black lemur (Eulemur macaco). We noninvasively collected hair and faecal samples from these species across different regions in Madagascar. We assessed DRB exon 2 polymorphism with a newly developed primer set, amplifying nearly all non-synonymous codons of the antigen-binding sites. We defined 26 DRB alleles from 45 individuals (17 alleles from E. rufifrons (N = 18); 5 from E. rubriventer (N = 7); and 4 from E. macaco (N = 20). All detected alleles are novel and show high levels of nucleotide (26.8%) and non-synonymous codon polymorphism (39.4%). In these lemur species, we found neither evidence of a duplication of DRB genes nor a sharing of alleles among sympatric groups or allopatric populations of the same species. The non-sharing of alleles may be the result of a geographical separation over a long time span and/or different pathogen selection pressures. We found dN/dS rates > 1 in the functionally important antigen recognition sites, providing evidence for balancing selection. Especially for small and isolated populations, quantifying and monitoring DRB variation are recommended to establish successful conservation plans that mitigate the possible loss of immunogenetic diversity in lemurs. © 2018, The Author(s).","balancing selection; eulemur; genetic diversity; major histocompatibility complex; polymorphism; nucleotide; hla dr antigen; allopatry; antibody combining site; antigen recognition; article; balancing selection; controlled study; eulemur macaco; eulemur rubriventer; eulemur rufifrons; feces analysis; gene duplication; gene sequence; genetic variability; hair analysis; lemuridae; madagascar; major histocompatibility complex; molecular cloning; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; seasonal variation; social structure; species difference; allele; animal; exon; female; genetics; immunology; lemuridae; male; alleles; animals; exons; female; hla-dr beta-chains; lemur; male; phylogeny"
"The endogenous bacteria alter gut epithelial apoptosis and decrease mortality following pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia","Fox AC, McConnell KW, Yoseph BP, Breed E, Liang Z, Clark AT, O'Donnell D, Zee-Cheng B, Jung E, Dominguez JA, Dunne WM, Burd EM, Coopersmith CM",2012,"Article","10.1097/SHK.0b013e31826e47e8","The endogenous bacteria have been hypothesized to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of critical illness, although their role in sepsis is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how commensal bacteria alter the host response to sepsis. Conventional and germ-free (GF) C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. All GF mice died within 2 days, whereas 44% of conventional mice survived for 7 days (P = 0.001). Diluting the dose of bacteria 10-fold in GF mice led to similar survival in GF and conventional mice. When animals with similar mortality were assayed for intestinal integrity, GF mice had lower levels of intestinal epithelial apoptosis but similar levels of proliferation and intestinal permeability. Germ-free mice had significantly lower levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with conventional mice without changes in systemic cytokine production. Under conventional conditions, sepsis unmasks lymphocyte control of intestinal epithelial apoptosis, because sepsis induces a greater increase in gut apoptosis in Rag-1-/- mice than in wild-type mice. However, in a separate set of experiments, gut apoptosis was similar between septic GF Rag-1-/- mice and septic GF wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that the endogenous bacteria play a protective role in mediating mortality from pneumonia-induced sepsis, potentially mediated through altered intestinal apoptosis and the local proinflammatory response. In addition, sepsis-induced lymphocyte-dependent increases in gut epithelial apoptosis appear to be mediated by the endogenous bacteria. © 2012 by the Shock Society.","apoptosis; commensal microflora; endogenous bacteria; germ-free; gut; intestine; pneumonia; sepsis; fas antigen; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; protein bax; protein bcl 2; protein bcl xl; protein bid; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; bacterial flora; bacterial immunity; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytokine production; dilution; intestine epithelium cell; intestine mucosa permeability; intestine villus; lung lavage; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; protein content; pseudomonas pneumonia; sepsis; survival time; wild type; animals; apoptosis; germ-free life; intestinal mucosa; mice; mice, knockout; pneumonia, bacterial; pseudomonas aeruginosa; pseudomonas infections; sepsis"

Using traditional coproscopic parasitological techniques, we compared the gastrointestinal protozoan and metazoan symbiont richness of two primates: the Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) and the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus). These species live sympatrically in both protected and unprotected forests within the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania with distinct ecological adaptations and diets. Our results showed that terrestrial and omnivorous yellow baboons had 2 (95% CI 1.47–2.73) and 3.78 (2.62–5.46) times higher gut symbiont richness (both including and excluding rare protozoans) compared to the arboreal and leaf-eating Udzungwa red colobus in unprotected and protected forest, respectively. We also found a consistent depletion of symbiont richness in red colobus living in the unprotected forest fragment compared to the continuous protected forests [the latter having 1.97 times (95% CI 1.33–2.92) higher richness], but not in yellow baboons. Richness reduction was particularly evident in the Udzungwa red colobus monkeys, confirming the pattern we reported previously for gut bacterial communities. This study demonstrates the impact of human activities even on the microbiodiversity of the intestinal tract of this species. Against the background of rapid global change and habitat degradation, and given the health benefits of intact gut communities, the decrease in natural gut symbionts reported here is worrying.

"Skin and gut microbiomes of a wild mammal respond to different environmental cues","Lavrinienko A, Tukalenko E, Mappes T, Watts PC",2018,"Article","10.1186/s40168-018-0595-0","Background: Animal skin and gut microbiomes are important components of host fitness. However, the processes that shape the microbiomes of wildlife are poorly understood, particularly with regard to exposure to environmental contaminants. We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to quantify how exposure to radionuclides impacts the skin and gut microbiota of a small mammal, the bank vole Myodes glareolus, inhabiting areas within and outside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), Ukraine. Results: Skin microbiomes of male bank voles were more diverse than females. However, the most pronounced differences in skin microbiomes occurred at a larger spatial scale, with higher alpha diversity in the skin microbiomes of bank voles from areas within the CEZ, whether contaminated by radionuclides or not, than in the skin microbiomes of animals from uncontaminated locations outside the CEZ, near Kyiv. Similarly, irrespective of the level of radionuclide contamination, skin microbiome communities (beta diversity) showed greater similarities within the CEZ, than to the areas near Kyiv. Hence, bank vole skin microbiome communities are structured more by geography than the level of soil radionuclides. This pattern presents a contrast with bank vole gut microbiota, where microbiomes could be strikingly similar among distant (~ 80 km of separation), uncontaminated locations, and where differences in microbiome community structure were associated with the level of radioactivity. We also found that the level of (dis)similarity between the skin and gut microbiome communities from the same individuals was contingent on the potential for exposure to radionuclides. Conclusions: Bank vole skin and gut microbiomes have distinct responses to similar environmental cues and thus are structured at different spatial scales. Our study shows how exposure to environmental pollution can affect the relationship between a mammalian host's skin and gut microbial communities, potentially homogenising the microbiomes in habitats affected by pollution. © 2018 The Author(s).","anthropogenic impact; biodiversity; ionising radiation; pollution; skin microbiome; wild mammal; cesium 137; radioisotope; rna 16s; radioisotope; rna 16s; actinobacteria; adult; article; association; bacteroidetes; body mass; community structure; controlled study; cyanobacterium; dna extraction; dosimetry; environmental exposure; female; firmicutes; gamma spectrometry; intestine flora; male; microbial community; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; myodes glareolus; nonhuman; priority journal; proteobacteria; radiation dose; skin flora; species richness; throat culture; animal; arvicolinae; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; genetics; geography; intestine flora; ionizing radiation; isolation and purification; microbiology; pollution; radiation response; skin; animals; arvicolinae; bacteria; biodiversity; environmental pollution; female; gastrointestinal microbiome; geography; male; radiation, ionizing; radioisotopes; rna, ribosomal, 16s; skin"
"Social influences on survival and reproduction: Insights from a long-term study of wild baboons","Alberts SC",2019,"Article","10.1111/1365-2656.12887","For social species, the environment has two components: physical and social. The social environment modifies the individual's interaction with the physical environment, and the physical environment may in turn impact individuals’ social relationships. This interplay can generate considerable variation among individuals in survival and reproduction. Here, I synthesize more than four decades of research on the baboons of the Amboseli basin in southern Kenya to illustrate how social and physical environments interact to affect reproduction and survival. For immature baboons, social behaviour can both mitigate and exacerbate the challenge of survival. Only c. 50% of live-born females and c. 44% of live-born males reach the median age of first reproduction. Variation in pre-adult survival, growth and development is associated with multiple aspects of the social environment. For instance, conspecifics provide direct care and are a major source of social knowledge about food and the environment, but conspecifics can also represent a direct threat to survival through infanticide. In adulthood, both competition (within and between social groups) and cooperative affiliation (i.e. collective action and/or the exchange of social resources such as grooming) are prominent features of baboon social life and have important consequences for reproduction and survival. For instance, adult females with higher social dominance ranks have accelerated reproduction, and adult females that engage in more frequent affiliative social interactions have higher survival throughout adulthood. The early life environment also has important consequences for adult reproduction and survival, as in a number of other bird and mammal species. In seasonal breeders, early life effects often apply to entire cohorts; in contrast, in nonseasonal and highly social species such as baboons, early life effects are more individual-specific, stemming from considerable variation not only in the early physical environment (even if they are born in the same year) but also in the particulars of their social environment. © 2018 The Authors.

"Effects of myeloid Hif-1β deletion on the intestinal microbiota in mice under environmental hypoxia","Han N, Pan Z, Huang Z, Chang Y, Hou F, Liu G, Yang R, Bi Y",2021,"Article","10.1128/IAI.00474-20","External environmental factors can cause an imbalance in intestinal flora. For people living in the extremes of a plateau climate, lack of oxygen is a primary health challenge that leads to a series of reactions. We wondered how intestinal microorganisms might change in a simulated plateau environment and what changes might occur in the host organism and intestinal microorganisms in the absence of hypoxia-related factors. In this study, mice carrying a knockout of hypoxia-inducible factor 1β (Hif-1β) in myeloid cells and wild-type mice were raised in a composite hypoxic chamber to simulate a plateau environment at 5,000 m of elevation for 14 days. The mice carrying the myeloid Hif-1β deletion displayed aggravated hypoxic phenotypes in comparison to and significantly greater weight loss and significantly higher cardiac index values than the wild-type group. The levels of some cytokines increased in the hypoxic environment. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that hypoxia had a significant effect on the gut microbiota in both wild-type and Hif-1β-deficient mice, especially on the first day. The levels of members of the Bacteroidaceae family increased continuously from day 1 to day 14 in Hif-1β deletion mice, and they represented an obviously different group of bacteria at day 14 compared with the wild-type mice. Butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Butyricicoccus, were found in wild-type mice only after 14 days in the hypoxic environment. In conclusion, hypoxia caused heart enlargement, greater weight loss, and obvious microbial imbalance in myeloid Hif-1β-deficient mice.

Pseudomonas fluorescens has also been associated with ileal Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of P. fluorescens on the paracellular permeability in ileum and Peyer's patches. Methods: To explore this question, in vivo and ex vivo experiments were performed in wild-type, Nod2-/-, Nod22939iC, and IL-1R-/- mice together with in vitro analyses using the Caco-2 (epithelial) and the THP-1 (monocyte) human cell lines. Results: Pseudomonas fluorescens increased the paracellular permeability of the intestinal mucosa through the secretion of IL-1β by the immune cell populations and the activation of myosin light chain kinase in the epithelial cells. Induction of the IL-1β pathway required the expression of Nod2 in the hematopoietic compartment, and muramyl dipeptide (a Nod2 ligand) had an inhibitory effect. Conclusions: Pseudomonas fluorescens thus alters the homeostasis of the epithelial barrier function by a mechanism similar to that previously observed for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.

The complexity of Hg in the environment can hinder accurate determination of ecological and human health risks, particularly within the context of the rapid global changes that are altering many ecological processes, socioeconomic patterns, and other factors like infectious disease incidence, which can affect Hg exposures and health outcomes. However, the success of global Hg-reduction efforts depends on accurate assessments of their effectiveness in reducing health risks. In this paper, we examine the role that key extrinsic and intrinsic drivers play on several aspects of Hg risk to humans and organisms in the environment. We do so within three key domains of ecological and human health risk. First, we examine how extrinsic global change drivers influence pathways of Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food webs. Next, we describe how extrinsic socioeconomic drivers at a global scale, and intrinsic individual-level drivers, influence human Hg exposure. Finally, we address how the adverse health effects of Hg in humans and wildlife are modulated by a range of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers within the context of rapid global change. Incorporating components of these three domains into research and monitoring will facilitate a more holistic understanding of how ecological and societal drivers interact to influence Hg health risks. © 2018, The Author(s).","asgm; biomagnification; fisheries; immunotoxicity; invasive species; microbiome; selenium; bioaccumulation; biomonitoring; complexity; disease incidence; global change; health risk; infectious disease; invasive species; mercury (element); pollution effect; pollution exposure; public health; selenite; selenium; toxicity; wild population; mercury; animal; environmental monitoring; food chain; human; pharmacokinetics; risk; toxicity; water pollutant; wild animal; animals; animals, wild; environmental monitoring; food chain; humans; mercury; risk; water pollutants, chemical"
"Characterization of acute pain-induced behavioral passivity in mice: Insights from statistical modeling","Yeung SC, Ganesan K, Wong SSC, Chung SK, Cheung CW",2021,"Article","10.1111/ejn.15174","Affective-motivational disturbances are highly inconsistent in animal pain models. The reproducibility of the open-field test in assessing anxiety, malaise or disability remains controversial despite its popularity. While traumatic, persistent or multiregional pain models are commonly considered more effective in inducing negative affect or functional impairment, the early psychobehavioral changes before pain chronification are often underexplored. Here, we aimed to clarify the fundamental relationship between hypernociception and passive distress-like behavior using a model of transient inflammatory pain. To minimize latent confounders and increase data consistency, male C57BL/6N mice were habituated to the open-field arena 6 times before receiving the unilateral intraplantar injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or vehicle. Open-field (40-min exploration) and nociceptive behavior were evaluated repeatedly along the course of hypernociception in both wild-type and transgenic mice with a known pronociceptive phenotype. To reduce subjectivity, multivariate open-field behavioral outcomes were analyzed by statistical modeling based on exploratory factor analyses, which yielded a 2-factor solution. Within 3 hr after PGE2 injection, mice developed significantly reduced center exploration (factor 1) and a marginally significant increase in their habituation tendency (factor 2), which were not apparent in vehicle-injected mice. The behavioral passivity generally improved as hypernociception subsided. Therefore, transient inflammatory irritation is sufficient to suppress mouse open-field exploratory activity. The apparent absence of late affective-motivational changes in some rodents with prolonged hypernociception may not imply a lack of preceding or underlying neuropsychological alterations. Procedural pain after invasive animal experiments, however small, should be assessed and adequately controlled as a potential research confounder. © 2021 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; anxiety; factor analysis; open field; stress; prostaglandin e2; adaptation; animal experiment; animal model; anxiety; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; distress syndrome; exploratory behavior; exploratory factor analysis; genotype; habituation; hargreaves test; inflammatory pain; male; motivation; mouse; neuropsychology; nociception; nociceptive stimulation; nonhuman; open field behavior; open field test; phenotype; physiological stress; priority journal; statistical model; time factor; transgenic mouse; von frey test; wild type mouse; animal; c57bl mouse; disease model; pain; pain measurement; reproducibility; acute pain; animals; dinoprostone; disease models, animal; male; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; pain measurement; reproducibility of results"

One interesting strategy is that of the giant panda, a member of the Carnivora that has evolved into a bamboo specialist. Giant pandas forage discriminately, but it remains unknown how nutritional hierarchical levels and landscape configuration heterogeneity affect foraging patch selection. Here, we used global positioning system collars to track wild giant pandas at high resolution (<10. m) and sampled foraging patches for nutritional hierarchical level analysis. We predicted that giant pandas select foraging patches with microhabitat characteristics that decrease energy expenditure during foraging according to optimal search theory. We introduce the concept of nutrient load as the product of local patch nutrient concentration and predicted that relatively efficient nutrients in fluctuating nutritional environments may determine foraging patch selection in giant pandas. This is the first time that microhabitat characteristics, key nutrients and foraging behavior have been studied in combination in giant pandas. We used random forest (RF) and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to infer habitat and nutritional factors that may influence foraging patch selection and utilization. Our results reveal that giant pandas select foraging patches with a topography that likely decreases energy expenditure. Giant pandas also favor protein-rich foraging patches, probably because protein can be digested and assimilated faster than cellulose and this maximizes net energy gains. These data provide a new perspective on foraging patch selection strategies in heterogeneous habitats of diet-specialized species under constant nutritional challenge.

"Seasonal variation in the gut microbiota of rhesus macaques inhabiting limestone forests of southwest Guangxi, China","Li Y, Chen T, Liang J, Li Y, Huang Z",2021,"Article","10.1007/s00203-020-02069-6","Data on the gut microbiota of animals can provide new insights into dietary ecology of hosts, consequently assisting in understanding their adaptation strategy and evolutionary potential. We studied the gut microbiota composition and function of the wild rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using 16S rRNA sequencing method. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota of the wild rhesus macaques was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes. Diversity and richness of gut microbiota were higher during the dry season than the rainy season. Specifically, higher proportions of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, and unclassified bacteria at the phylum level and more Coprococcus at the genus level were detected in the dry season. Predictive functional analysis showed that pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism and drug resistance (antimicrobial and antineoplastic) were richer in the dry season. These seasonal differences in microbiota could be due to their heavier dependence on leaf-based diet in the dry season. Additionally, macaques in limestone forests had a higher percentage of Spirochaetes, probably suggesting that the proportion of fruits in dietary composition also play an important role in the gut microbiota. We concluded that diet was strongly linked to the diversity, composition, and function of the gut microbiota in the wild groups of rhesus macaques living in the limestone forest, highlighting the importance of diet in the gut microbiota of macaques and the need to conduct further study on the adaptation strategy in response of environmental changes in the ground of gut microbiota. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","gut microbiota; limestone forest; macaca mulatta; rhesus macaques; seasonal variation; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; limestone; rna 16s; rna 16s; animal experiment; antibiotic resistance; article; bifidobacterium; blautia; carbohydrate metabolism; coprococcus; cyanobacterium; diet composition; dietary fiber; digestion; dry season; evolutionary adaptation; fruit; genus; guangxi; intestine flora; microbial diversity; mollicutes; nonhuman; oscillospira; phylum; plant leaf; population abundance; prediction; prevotella; priority journal; rainy season; rhesus monkey; rna sequencing; ruminococcus; seasonal rain forest; seasonal variation; species composition; species richness; treponema; wild animal; animal; bacterium; biodiversity; china; classification; diet; forest; genetics; intestine flora; microbiology; rhesus monkey; season; animals; bacteria; biodiversity; china; diet; forests; gastrointestinal microbiome; macaca mulatta; rna, ribosomal, 16s; seasons"
"Exposure to diesel exhaust particles results in altered lung microbial profiles, associated with increased reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species and inflammation, in C57Bl/6 wildtype mice on a high-fat diet","Daniel S, Phillippi D, Schneider LJ, Nguyen KN, Mirpuri J, Lund AK",2021,"Article","10.1186/s12989-020-00393-9","Background: Exposure to traffic-generated emissions is associated with the development and exacerbation of inflammatory lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Although many lung diseases show an expansion of Proteobacteria, the role of traffic-generated particulate matter pollutants on the lung microbiota has not been well-characterized. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) can alter commensal lung microbiota, thereby promoting alterations in the lung’s immune and inflammatory responses. We aimed to understand whether diet might also contribute to the alteration of the commensal lung microbiome, either alone or related to exposure. To do this, we used male C57Bl/6 mice (4–6-week-old) on either regular chow (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet (45% kcal fat), randomly assigned to be exposed via oropharyngeal aspiration to 35 μg DEP, suspended in 35 μl 0.9% sterile saline or sterile saline only (control) twice a week for 30 days. A separate group of study animals on the HF diet was concurrently treated with 0.3 g/day of Winclove Ecologic® Barrier probiotics in their drinking water throughout the study. Results: Our results show that DEP-exposure increases lung tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) histologically and by RT-qPCR, as well as Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), as quantified by ELISA. We also observed an increase in macrophage infiltration and peroxynitrite, a marker of reactive oxygen species (ROS) + reactive nitrogen species (RNS), immunofluorescence staining in the lungs of DEP-exposed and HF-diet animals, which was further exacerbated by concurrent DEP-exposure and HF-diet consumption. Histological examinations revealed enhanced inflammation and collagen deposition in the lungs DEP-exposed mice, regardless of diet. We observed an expansion of Proteobacteria, by qPCR of bacterial 16S rRNA, in the BALF of DEP-exposed mice on the HF diet, which was diminished with probiotic-treatment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that exposure to DEP causes persistent and sustained inflammation and bacterial alterations in a ROS-RNS mediated fashion, which is exacerbated by concurrent consumption of an HF diet. © 2021, The Author(s).","diesel particulate matter; inflammation; lung microbiome; probiotics; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen species; diesel exhaust particle; immunoglobulin a; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin g; interleukin 10; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; toxic substance; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; nitrogen; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; rna 16s; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; cell infiltration; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; environmental exposure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fibrosing alveolitis; immunoglobulin blood level; inflammation; lipid diet; lung microbiota; male; mouse; nonhuman; pneumonia; population abundance; priority journal; protein expression; proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; animal; c57bl mouse; exhaust gas; inflammation; lung; particulate matter; toxicity; animals; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; diet, high-fat; inflammation; lung; male; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; nitrogen; particulate matter; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen species; rna, ribosomal, 16s; vehicle emissions"

Some field studies have reported that host genotype frequencies in natural populations change over time according to parasite-driven negative frequency-dependent selection. However, the temporal patterns of parasite genotypes have rarely been investigated. Moreover, parasite-driven negative frequency-dependent selection is contingent on the existence of genetic specificity between hosts and parasites. In the present study, the population dynamics and host-genotype specificity of the ichthyosporean Caullerya mesnili, a common endoparasite of Daphnia water fleas, were analysed based on the observed sequence variation in the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA. The Daphnia population of lake Greifensee (Switzerland) was sampled and subjected to parasite screening and host genotyping during C. mesnili epidemics of four consecutive years. The ITS1 of wild-caught C. mesnili-infected Daphnia was sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing platform. The relative frequencies of C. mesnili ITS1 sequences differed significantly among years: the most abundant C. mesnili ITS1 sequence decreased and rare sequences increased over the course of the study, a pattern consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection. However, only a weak signal of host-genotype specificity between C. mesnili and Daphnia genotypes was detected. Use of cutting edge genomic techniques will allow further investigation of the underlying micro-evolutionary relationships within the Daphnia–C. mesnili system. © 2016 The Authors","caullerya mesnili; host-genotype specificity; negative frequency-dependent selection; parasite population dynamics; ribosomal spacer dna; animal; daphnia; genetic selection; genetics; genotype; host parasite interaction; host range; ichthyosporea; immunology; parasitology; physiology; time factor; animals; daphnia; dna, ribosomal spacer; genotype; host specificity; host-parasite interactions; mesomycetozoea; selection, genetic; time factors"
"TLR9 regulates adipose tissue inflammation and obesity-related metabolic disorders","Hong C-P, Yun CH, Lee G-W, Park A, Kim Y-M, Jang MH",2015,"Article","10.1002/oby.21215","Objective Recent studies have revealed a link between Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and the adipose tissue inflammation associated with obesity. Although TLR9 is known to play an important role in inflammation and innate immunity, its role in mediating adipose tissue inflammation has not yet been investigated. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the role of TLR9 in regulating immune cells in visceral adipose tissue and maintaining the metabolic homeostasis. Methods Wild-type and TLR9-deficient mice were fed with a high-fat diet, and the body weight gain, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and adipose tissue inflammation were examined. Results TLR9-deficient mice gained significantly more weight and body fat under a high-fat diet than wild-type mice and exhibited more severe glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We also found a dramatic increase of M1 macrophages as well as TH1 cells in the adipose tissue of TLR9-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, the levels of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were higher in TLR9-deficient mice.

"Faecal metabarcoding reveals pervasive long-distance impacts of garden bird feeding","Shutt JD, Trivedi UH, Nicholls JA",2021,"Article","10.1098/rspb.2021.0480","Supplementary feeding of wildlife is widespread, being undertaken by more than half of households in many countries. However, the impact that these supplemental resources have is unclear, with impacts largely considered to be restricted to urban ecosystems. We reveal the pervasiveness of supplementary foodstuffs in the diet of a wild bird using metabarcoding of blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) faeces collected in early spring from a 220 km transect in Scotland with a large urbanization gradient. Supplementary foodstuffs were present in the majority of samples, with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) the single commonest (either natural or supplementary) dietary item. Consumption rates exhibited a distance decay from human habitation but remained high at several hundred metres from the nearest household and continued to our study limit of 1.4 km distant. Supplementary food consumption was associated with a near quadrupling of blue tit breeding density and a 5-day advancement of breeding phenology. We show that woodland bird species using supplementary food have increasing UK population trends, while species that do not, and/or are outcompeted by blue tits, are likely to be declining. We suggest that the impacts of supplementary feeding are larger and more spatially extensive than currently appreciated and could be disrupting population and ecosystem dynamics. © 2021 The Authors.","breeding density; diet; human-wildlife interaction; phenology; population change; supplementary provisioning; bird; feeding ecology; genetic analysis; arachis hypogaea; cyanistes caeruleus; animal; ecosystem; feces; human; land use; passeriformes; plant breeding; scotland; animals; ecosystem; feces; gardens; humans; passeriformes; plant breeding; scotland"

The disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and consequent escape of microbial products may be one of these environmental triggers. However, the immune receptors that are activated in this context remain elusive. We show here that during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2), but not NOD1, participates in the pathogenesis of the disease by inducing T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells in the pancreatic LNs (PLNs) and pancreas. Additionally, STZ-injected wild-type (WT) diabetic mice displayed an altered gut microbiota compared with vehicle-injected WT mice, together with the translocation of bacteria to the PLNs. Interestingly, WT mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) were fully protected from STZ-induced T1D, which correlated with the abrogation of bacterial translocation to the PLNs. Notably, when Abx-treated STZ-injected WT mice received the NOD2 ligand muramyl dipeptide, both hyperglycemia and the proinflammatory immune response were restored. Our results demonstrate that the recognition of bacterial products by NOD2 inside the PLNs contributes to T1D development, establishing a new putative target for intervention during the early stages of the disease. © 2016 Costa et al.","; antibiotic agent; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; glucose; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 23; interleukin 6; messenger rna; card15 protein, mouse; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; animal experiment; animal model; antibiotic therapy; article; dendritic cell; flow cytometry; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; hyperglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; intestine flora; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; pancreatic lymph node; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; th1 cell; th17 cell; tunel assay; animal; bacterial translocation; experimental diabetes mellitus; genetics; immunology; knockout mouse; lymph node; microbiology; pancreas; pathology; animals; bacterial translocation; diabetes mellitus, experimental; diabetes mellitus, type 1; gastrointestinal microbiome; lymph nodes; male; mice; mice, knockout; nod2 signaling adaptor protein; pancreas"
"Short-term time-restricted feeding during the resting phase is sufficient to induce leptin resistance that contributes to development of obesity and metabolic disorders in mice","Oishi K, Hashimoto C",2018,"Article","10.1080/07420528.2018.1496927","Feeding at unusual times of the day is thought to be associated with obesity and metabolic disorders in both experimental animals and humans. We previously reported that time-imposed feeding during the sleep phase (daytime feeding, DF) induces obesity and metabolic disorders compared with mice fed only during the active phase (nighttime feeding, NF). The present study aimed to determine whether leptin resistance is caused by DF, and whether it is involved in the underlying mechanisms of DF-induced obesity in mice, since leptin plays an essential role in regulating energy expenditure and adiposity in addition to food intake. We compared leptin sensitivity by evaluating the effects of exogenous injected leptin on food intake and body weight in wild-type C57BL/6J mice under NF and DF. The mice were fed with a high-fat high-sucrose diet throughout the study. To determine whether leptin resistance is a cause or a result of DF-induced obesity with metabolic disorders, we restricted the feeding times of leptin resistant db/db mice. We also examined leptin sensitivity in leptin deficient ob/ob mice under NF and DF to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of DF-induced leptin resistance. C57BL/6J mice under DF gained more weight and adiposity compared with mice under NF, and developed hyperleptinemia and hypothermia. We found that six days of DF abolished exogenous leptin-induced hypophagia and reduction in body weight in mice. We also found that the leptin injection significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of NF, but not in DF mice, suggesting that short-term DF was sufficient to induce metabolic leptin resistance. The DF-induced increases in body weight gain, food efficiency, adipose tissue mass, lipogenic gene expression in metabolic tissues, and hepatic lipid accumulation were abolished in db/db mice, suggesting that the leptin resistance is a cause of DF-induced metabolic disorders. DF resulted in deep hypothermia in db/db, as well as in wild-type mice, suggesting that a decrease in energy expenditure was not the main cause of DF-induced obesity. Exogenous leptin reduced the body weight of ob/ob mice under both NF and DF, and the effect was significantly higher in DF- than in NF-ob/ob mice. Therefore, the development of DF-induced leptin resistance requires endogenous leptin, and central leptin sensitivity fluctuates in a circadian manner. The present findings suggest that leptin resistance is responsible for DF-induced obesity and metabolic disorders, and that the circadian fluctuation of central leptin sensitivity might be involved in leptin resistance induced by DF, although further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of metabolic disorders that depend on the time of feeding.

Interleukin(IL)-37 is an immunosuppressive cytokine belonging to the IL-1 superfamily with no mouse homologue yet identified, the effects of which have not been studied in stroke. Here we report: (1) the effect of ischemic stroke on circulating IL-37 in humans; and (2) the effect of IL-37 on stroke outcome measures in mice transgenic for human IL-37 (IL-37tg). We found that in the first 3 days after ischemic stroke in 55 patients, the plasma abundance of IL-37 was ~2-fold higher than in 24 controls. In IL-37tg mice, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion resulted in marked increases in plasma IL-37 (~9-fold) and brain IL-37 mRNA (~7,000-fold) at 24 h compared with sham-operated IL-37tg mice. Further, compared with wild-type (WT) mice subjected to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, IL-37tg mice exhibited less severe locomotor deficit, smaller cerebral infarcts and reduced bacterial lung infection. In the ischemic hemisphere, there were 60% fewer pro-inflammatory microglia-macrophages and up to 4-fold higher expression of anti-inflammatory markers in IL-37tg compared to WT mice.

The gut microbiota may buffer changes in energy demands, with shifts in community composition increasing the energy production potential of the gut during pregnancy and lactation. In this study, we examine changes in the gut microbiome of wild, female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) across different reproductive states. Fecal samples (n = 39) were collected from five adult females over the course of a year. Gut microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequences, and PICRUSt was used to make metagenomic functional predictions. We found a significant relationship between reproductive state and both the structure and predicted function of the gut microbiome, neither of which were associated with host diet. For example, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower in lactating females compared with cycling females; the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly higher in pregnant females compared with lactating females, and there was a trend toward higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria in pregnant females compared with cycling females. The results of this study suggest that, in addition to behavioral and dietary adaptions, the gut microbiota may play a role in allowing female primates to meet their changing energetic needs during reproduction.

A general notion is that p53 is necessary for efficient oxidative metabolism. The importance of UCP1-dependent uncoupled respi- ration and increased oxidation of glucose and fatty acids in brown or brown-like adipocytes, termed brite or beige, in relation to energy balance and homeostasis has been highlighted recently. UCP1-dependent uncoupled respiration in classic interscapular brown adipose tissue is central to cold-induced thermogenesis, whereas brite/beige adipocytes are of special importance in rela- tion to diet-induced thermogenesis, where the importance of UCP1 is only clearly manifested in mice kept at thermoneutrality. We challenged wild-type and TRP53-deficient mice by high-fat feed- ing under thermoneutral conditions. Interestingly, mice lacking TRP53 gained less weight compared with their wild-type counter- parts. This was related to an increased expression of Ucp1 and other PPARGC1a and PPARGC1b target genes but not Ppargc1a or Ppargc1b in inguinal white adipose tissue of mice lacking TRP53. We show that TRP53, independently of its ability to bind DNA, inhibits the activity of PPARGC1a and PPARGC1b.

To better understand how the progression of inflammation impacts the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, we used culture independent taxonomic profiling to identify temporal changes in the cecal microbiota of C3Bir IL-10-/- mice concomitantly with the onset and progression of colitis. This analysis revealed that IL-10-/- mice displayed a biphasic progression in disease severity, as evidenced by histopathological scores and cytokine production. Beginning at 4 weeks of age, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-1α as well as chemokines including RANTES and MIP-1α were elevated in the serum of IL-10-/- mice. By 19 weeks of age, the mice developed clinical signs of disease as evidenced by weight loss, which was accompanied by a significant increase in serum levels of KC and IL-17. While the overall diversity of the microbiota of both wild type and IL-10-/- were similar in young mice, the latter failed to increase in complexity as the mice matured and experienced changes in abundance of specific bacterial taxa that are associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans. Collectively, these results reveal that there is a critical time in young mice between four to six weeks of age when inflammation and the associated immune responses adversely affect maturation of the microbiota. © Copyright © 2021 Overstreet, Ramer-Tait, Suchodolski, Hostetter, Wang, Jergens, Phillips and Wannemuehler.","colitis; cytokine response; dysbiosis; enterobacteriaceae; ibd; il-10; microbiome; temporal dynamic changes; cxcl1 chemokine; gamma interferon; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 6; rna 16s; serum amyloid a; tumor necrosis factor; xenobiotic agent; il10 protein, mouse; interleukin 10; age; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial flora; bacterial metabolism; biosynthesis; butyrivibrio; chlamydia muridarum; chronic inflammation; colitis; controlled study; cytokine production; disease exacerbation; disease severity; dna repair; dorea; enteritis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; escherichia; female; gene sequence; helicobacter hepaticus; histopathology; immune response; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; intestine injury; lactococcus; metabolite; microbial community; microbial diversity; mouse; nonhuman; oscillibacter; pseudomonas; rna sequence; roseburia; signal transduction; animal; cecum; immunology; inflammation; intestine flora; knockout mouse; microbiology; animals; cecum; colitis; female; gastrointestinal microbiome; inflammation; interleukin-10; mice; mice, knockout"

Mutations in nucleotide oligomeriation domain 2 [NOD2] are CD risk factors. Increase of intestinal permeability, CD4+ T cell infiltration, and bacterial dysbiosis are also seen in Nod2-knockout [Nod2KO] mice. However, the specificity and relationship between these Nod2-associated abnormalities remain largely unexplored. Methods: Wild-type [WT], Nod1-knockout [Nod1KO] and Nod2KO mice were analysed in parallel. Microbial composition was defined by 454-pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Mucin and antimicrobial peptide expression was assessed by RT-PCR. Cell populations from Peyer's patches were determined by flow cytometry. Ussing chambers were used to measure intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation. Finally, to explore the impact of colonisation with mother's microbiota at birth, analyses were also performed in Nod2KO and WT mice born from WT surrogate mothers after embryo transfer. Results: Nod2KO mice exhibited colonic bacterial dysbiosis different from WT and Nod1KO mice. Altered expression of antimicrobial peptides and mucins in ileum and colon was associated with the microbial composition. Bacterial composition of Nod2KO and WT mice obtained by embryo transfer was similar to that observed in Nod2KO mice, arguing for a dominant effect of Nod2KOassociated dysbiosis. In contrast, increased levels of CD4+ T cells and gut barrier defects across Peyer's patches were specific to Nod2 deficiency and independent of Microbial dysbiosis.

"Changing expression of vertebrate immunity genes in an anthropogenic environment: A controlled experiment","Hablützel PI, Brown M, Friberg IM, Jackson JA",2016,"Article","10.1186/s12862-016-0751-8","Background: The effect of anthropogenic environments on the function of the vertebrate immune system is a problem of general importance. For example, it relates to the increasing rates of immunologically-based disease in modern human populations and to the desirability of identifying optimal immune function in domesticated animals. Despite this importance, our present understanding is compromised by a deficit of experimental studies that make adequately matched comparisons between wild and captive vertebrates. Results: We transferred post-larval fishes (three-spined sticklebacks), collected in the wild, to an anthropogenic (captive) environment. We then monitored, over 11 months, how the systemic expression of immunity genes changed in comparison to cohort-matched wild individuals in the originator population (total n = 299). We found that a range of innate (lyz, defbl2, il1r-like, tbk1) and adaptive (cd8a, igmh) immunity genes were up-regulated in captivity, accompanied by an increase in expression of the antioxidant enzyme, gpx4a. For some genes previously known to show seasonality in the wild, this appeared to be reduced in captive fishes. Captive fishes tended to express immunity genes, including igzh, foxp3b, lyz, defbl2, and il1r-like, more variably. Furthermore, although gene co-expression patterns (analyzed through gene-by-gene correlations and mutual information theory based networks) shared common structure in wild and captive fishes, there was also significant divergence. For one gene in particular, defbl2, high expression was associated with adverse health outcomes in captive fishes. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate widespread regulatory changes in the immune system in captive populations, and that the expression of immunity genes is more constrained in the wild. An increase in constitutive systemic immune activity, such as we observed here, may alter the risk of immunopathology and contribute to variance in health in vertebrate populations exposed to anthropogenic environments. © 2016 The Author(s).","anthropogenic habitats; gene expression; immunity; immunoregulation; seasonality; vertebrate; adaptation; animal; anthropogenic effect; antioxidant; divergence; environmental conditions; enzyme activity; experimental study; finfish; gene expression; immune system; immunity; innate behavior; seasonality; animalia; gasterosteus aculeatus; pisces; vertebrata; adaptive immunity; animal; ecosystem; environment; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; immunity; immunology; innate immunity; larva; real time polymerase chain reaction; season; smegmamorpha; upregulation; vertebrate; adaptive immunity; animals; ecosystem; environment; gene expression regulation; humans; immunity; immunity, innate; larva; real-time polymerase chain reaction; seasons; smegmamorpha; up-regulation; vertebrates"

As an ancient reptile, the crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus) is facing extreme danger of extinction, resulting in great significance to species conservation in the reserve. Thus, it is critical to understand the differences in gut microbiota composition between captive and wild populations, as it could provide fundamental information for conservative management of crocodile lizards. Here, fecal samples of crocodile lizards were collected from two wild and one captive populations with different ages (i.e., juveniles and adults) and were analyzed for microbiota composition by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing. This study showed that the lizard gut microbiota was mainly composed of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The gut microbiota composition of crocodile lizard did not differ between juveniles and adults, as well as between two wild populations. Interestingly, captivity increased community richness and influenced community structures of gut microbiota in crocodile lizards, compared with wild congeners. This was indicated by higher abundances of the genera Epulopiscium and Glutamicibacter. These increases might be induced by complex integration of simple food resources or human contact in captivity. The gut microbiota functions of crocodile lizards are primarily enriched in metabolism, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, and cellular processes based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. This study provides fundamental information about the gut microbiota of crocodile lizards in wild and captive populations. In the future, exploring the relationship among diet, gut microbiota, and host health is necessary for providing animal conservation strategies. © Copyright © 2020 Tang, Liang, Yang, Wang, Chen, Du, Li and Sun.","age; captive population; gut microbiota; shinisaurus crocodilurus; wild animal conservation; wild population; abc transporter; rna 16s; acinetobacter; actinobacteria; adult; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; article; bacteroidetes; biogeography; bioinformatics; carbohydrate metabolism; clostridium; cyanobacterium; dna denaturation; dna extraction; dna purification; dna template; energy metabolism; enterobacteriaceae; environmental factor; firmicutes; food composition; fusobacteria; gene amplification; intestine flora; juvenile; lachnospiraceae; lizard; microbial community; microbial diversity; micrococcaceae; nonhuman; peptostreptococcaceae; planctomycetes; polymerase chain reaction; proteobacteria"
"Eosinophil activities modulate the immune/inflammatory character of allergic respiratory responses in mice","Jacobsen EA, LeSuer WE, Willetts L, Zellner KR, Mazzolini K, Antonios N, Beck B, Protheroe C, Ochkur SI, Colbert D, Lacy P, Moqbel R, Appleton J, Lee NA, Lee JJ",2014,"Article","10.1111/all.12321","Background: The importance and specific role(s) of eosinophils in modulating the immune/inflammatory phenotype of allergic pulmonary disease remain to be defined. Established animal models assessing the role(s) of eosinophils as contributors and/or causative agents of disease have relied on congenitally deficient mice where the developmental consequences of eosinophil depletion are unknown. Methods: We developed a novel conditional eosinophil-deficient strain of mice (iPHIL) through a gene knock-in strategy inserting the human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (DTR) into the endogenous eosinophil peroxidase genomic locus. Results: Expression of DTR rendered resistant mouse eosinophil progenitors sensitive to DT without affecting any other cell types. The presence of eosinophils was shown to be unnecessary during the sensitization phase of either ovalbumin (OVA) or house dust mite (HDM) acute asthma models. However, eosinophil ablation during airway challenge led to a predominantly neutrophilic phenotype (>15% neutrophils) accompanied by allergen-induced histopathologies and airway hyper-responsiveness in response to methacholine indistinguishable from eosinophilic wild-type mice. Moreover, the iPHIL neutrophilic airway phenotype was shown to be a steroid-resistant allergic respiratory variant that was reversible upon the restoration of peripheral eosinophils. Conclusions: Eosinophil contributions to allergic immune/inflammatory responses appear to be limited to the airway challenge and not to the sensitization phase of allergen provocation models. The reversible steroid-resistant character of the iPHIL neutrophilic airway variant suggests underappreciated mechanisms by which eosinophils shape the character of allergic respiratory responses. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"The Composition of Gut Microbiota Community Structure of Jankowski's Bunting (Emberiza jankowskii)","Shang WP, Li S, Zhang LS, Wu H, Jiang YL",2020,"Article","10.1007/s00284-020-02048-6","Gut microbiota play a central role in the health of animals. The bacteria that individuals acquire as they age may therefore have a profound effect on their future fitness. Since most birds are capable of flight, they can be widely distributed in and adapted to various ecosystems. Moreover, birds are also challenged by the need to digest a wide range of food resources in their guts. However, little is known regarding how the microbial community structure in birds, especially wild birds, changes with host age. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region to depict the microbial composition and structure in the adults and nestlings of Jankowski's bunting (Emberiza jankowskii), an endangered species of bird, during the breeding season. The results showed that the phyla Proteobacteria (52.45%), Firmicutes (13.87%), Bacteroidetes (5.76%), Actinobacteria (4.95%), Planctomycetes (4.36%), Euryarchaeota (3.20%), Acidobacteria (2.59%), Fusobacteria (2.24%), and Chloroflexi (1.8%) dominated the gut microbial communities in Jankowski's bunting. There was no significant difference in the alpha diversity and richness among different age groups. There was also no significant difference in species richness and diversity between the nestlings and adults. However, we observed different bacterial compositions at the genus level. The generaPhotobacteriumandBrochothrixwere detected only in the nestling groups (at days 3, 6, and 9), whileDiplorickettsiawas detected only in the adult group. In summary, this study can provide additional information regarding the intestinal microorganisms of wild passerine and grassland birds and provide theoretical evidence for methods to protect Jankowski's bunting.","; ribosomal-rna gene; bacterial communities; diversity; bird; age"
"Fish skin and gut microbiomes show contrasting signatures of host species and habitat","Sylvain F-E, Holland A, Bouslama S, Audet-Gilbert E, Lavoie C, Luis Val A, Derome N",2020,"Article","10.1128/AEM.00789-20","Teleost fish represent an invaluable repertoire of host species to study the factors shaping animal-associated microbiomes. Several studies have shown that the phylogenetic structure of the fish gut microbiome is driven by species-specific (e.g., host ancestry, genotype, or diet) and habitat-specific (e.g., hydrochemical parameters and bacterioplankton composition) factors. However, our understanding of other host-associated microbial niches, such as the skin mucus microbiome, remains limited. The goal of our study was to explore simultaneously the phylogenetic structure of the fish skin mucus and gut microbiome and compare the effect of speciesand habitat-specific drivers on the structure of microbial communities in both tissues. We sampled 114 wild fish from 6 populations of 3 ecologically and phylogenetically contrasting Amazonian teleost species. Water samples were collected at each site, and 10 physicochemical parameters were characterized. The skin mucus, gut, and water microbial communities were characterized using a metabarcoding approach targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA. Our results showed a significant distinction between the phylogenetic profile and diversity of the microbiome from each microbial niche. Skin mucus and bacterioplankton communities were significantly closer in composition than gut and free-living communities. Species-specific factors mostly modulated gut bacterial communities, while the skin mucus microbiome was predominantly associated with environmental physicochemistry and bacterioplankton community structure. These results suggest that the variable skin mucus community is a relevant target for the development of microbial biomarkers of environmental status, while the more conserved gut microbiome is better suited to study long-term host-microbe interactions over evolutionary time scales. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.","amazon; fish; gut; habitat; host; microbiome; phylosymbiosis; skin; species; teleost; bacteria; ecosystems; rna; bacterial community; community structures; hydrochemical parameters; microbial communities; phylogenetic profile; phylogenetic structures; physicochemical parameters; species specifics; fish; bacterioplankton; biomarker; community structure; genotype; hydrochemistry; phylogenetics; skin; teleost; timescale; animalia; bacteria (microorganisms); teleostei; bacterial rna; rna 16s; animal; bacterium; brazil; characiformes; cichlid; classification; ecosystem; intestine flora; isolation and purification; microbiology; mucosa; phylogeny; skin; species difference; animals; bacteria; brazil; characiformes; cichlids; ecosystem; gastrointestinal microbiome; host microbial interactions; mucous membrane; phylogeny; rna, bacterial; rna, ribosomal, 16s; skin; species specificity"
"Genetic manipulation of wild human gut bacteroides","Bencivenga-Barry NA, Lim B, Herrera CM, Stephen Trent M, Goodman AL",2020,"Article","10.1128/JB.00544-19","Bacteroides is one of the most prominent genera in the human gut microbiome, and study of this bacterial group provides insights into gut microbial ecology and pathogenesis. In this report, we introduce a negative selection system for rapid and efficient allelic exchange in wild Bacteroides species that does not require any alterations to the genetic background or a nutritionally defined culture medium. In this approach, dual antibacterial effectors normally delivered via type VI secretion are targeted to the bacterial periplasm under the control of tightly regulated anhydrotetracycline (aTC)-inducible promoters. Introduction of aTC selects for recombination events producing the desired genetic modification, and the dual effector design allows for broad applicability across strains that may have immunity to one counterselection effector. We demonstrate the utility of this approach across 21 human gut Bacteroides isolates representing diverse species, including strains isolated directly from human donors. We use this system to establish that antimicrobial peptide resistance in Bacteroides vulgatus is determined by the product of a gene that is not included in the genomes of previously genetically tractable members of the human gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE Human gut Bacteroides species exhibit strain-level differences in their physiology, ecology, and impact on human health and disease. However, existing approaches for genetic manipulation generally require construction of genetically modified parental strains for each microbe of interest or defined medium formulations. In this report, we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for targeted genetic manipulation of diverse wild-type Bacteroides species from the human gut.

Eurasian perch larvae from wild and domesticated spawners were reared in the same conditions and at different development stages, growth performance variables, the expression of genes encoding digestive enzymes and specific enzymatic activity were analysed. No significant differences in hatching rate, deformity rate or swim bladder inflation effectiveness between wild and domesticated larvae were found. Specific growth rate, final total length and wet body weight were significantly lower in wild larvae, whereas higher mortality in wild larvae was observed compared to domesticated larvae. The data obtained in this study clearly indicate that during domestication, significant modification of digestion ability occurs at the very beginning of ontogeny, where domesticated fish are characterised by lower enzymatic activity and lower expression of genes encoding digestive enzymes. This probably results from the low diversity of the food offered in culture conditions, which significantly modified digestion capability.

Although this variant does not appear to affect risk for colorectal cancer, we questioned whether it would affect growth of colorectal tumors. We induced tumor formation in a mouse model for MTHFD1-synthetase deficiency (Mthfd1S+/−) using combined administration of azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in male and female wild-type and Mthfd1S+/− mice. Tumor size was significantly smaller in MthfdS+/− mice, particularly in males. A reduction in the proliferation of MthfdS+/− mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines, compared with wild-type lines, was also observed. Tumor number was not influenced by genotype. The amount of inflammation observed within tumors from male Mthfd1S+/− mice was lower than that in wild-type mice. Gene expression analysis in tumor adjacent normal (pre-neoplastic) tissue identified several genes involved in proliferation (Fosb, Fos, Ptk6, Esr2, Atf3) and inflammation (Atf3, Saa1, TNF-α) that were downregulated in MthfdS+/− males. In females, MthfdS+/− genotype was not associated with these gene expression changes, or with differences in tumor inflammation. These findings suggest that the mechanisms directing tumor growth differ significantly between males and females. We suggest that restriction of purine synthesis, reduced expression of genes involved in proliferation, and/or reduced inflammation lead to slower tumor growth in MTHFD1-synthetase deficiency. These findings may have implications for CRC tumor growth and prognosis in individuals with the R653Q variant. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","aom-dss; carcinogenesis; colorectal cancer; folate metabolism; mthfd1; azoxymethane; dextran sulfate; methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase; synthetase; unclassified drug; azoxymethane; dextran sulfate; formate tetrahydrofolate ligase; formyl-methenyl-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase; hydrolase; methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase; methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; minor histocompatibility antigen; mthfd1 protein, human; mthfd1 protein, mouse; multienzyme complex; multifunctional enzyme; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; colorectal tumor; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme deficiency; female; fibroblast; gene expression; genetic association; genotype; male; methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase deficiency; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; tumor volume; wild type; animal; cell culture; chemically induced; colorectal tumor; deficiency; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; pathology; aminohydrolases; animals; azoxymethane; cell proliferation; cells, cultured; colorectal neoplasms; dextran sulfate; female; formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase; gene expression regulation, neoplastic; humans; male; methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase; methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (nadp); mice; minor histocompatibility antigens; multienzyme complexes; multifunctional enzymes; polymorphism, single nucleotide"
"Geographical separation and physiology drive differentiation of microbial communities of two discrete populations of the bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae","Gaona O, Cerqueda-García D, Moya A, Neri-Barrios X, Falcón LI",2020,"Article","10.1002/mbo3.1022","In this paper, we explore how two discrete and geographically separated populations of the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae)—one in central and the other in the Pacific region of Mexico—differ in their fecal microbiota composition. Considering the microbiota–host as a unity, in which extrinsic (as food availability and geography) or intrinsic factors (as physiology) play an important role in the microbiota composition, we would expect differentiation in the microbiota of two geographically separated populations. The Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASVs) of the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene from 68 individuals were analyzed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We obtained a total of 11 566 (ASVs). The bacterial communities in the Central and Pacific populations had a diversity of 6,939 and 4,088 ASVs, respectively, sharing a core microbiota of 539 ASVs accounting for 75% of the relative abundance, suggesting stability over evolutionary time. The Weighted UniFrac metrics tested by a PERMANOVA showed that lactating and pregnant females had significant beta diversity differences in the two populations compared with other reproductive stages. This could be a consequence of the increased energy requirements of these physiological stages, more than the variation due to geographical separation. In contrast, a positive correlation of the observed ASVs of fecal microbiota with the observed ASVs of plastids related to the diet was observed in the juveniles and adults, suggesting that in these physiological stages an extrinsic factor as the diet shapes the microbiota composition. The results provide a baseline for future studies of the microbiome in these two wild populations of the lesser long-nosed bat, the main pollinator of the Agaves from which the beverages tequila and mezcal are made. © 2020 The Authors.

"Interleukin-21 (IL-21) downregulates dendritic cell cytokine responses to helicobacter pylori and modulates T lymphocyte IL-17A expression in peyer's patches during infection","Yasmin S, Dixon BREA, Olivares-Villagómez D, Scott Algood HM",2019,"Article","10.1128/IAI.00237-19","Interleukin-21 (IL-21), a cytokine produced by many subsets of activated immune cells, is critical for driving inflammation in several models. Using Helicobacter pylori infection as a model for chronic mucosal infection, we previously published that IL-21 is required for the development of gastritis in response to infection. Concomitant with protection from chronic inflammation, H. pylori-infected IL-21-/- mice exhibited limited Th1 and Th17 responses in their gastric mucosa. Here we report that H. pylori-infected IL-21-/- mice express significantly higher levels of IL-17A than H. pylori-infected wild-type (WT) mice in the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. This led us to hypothesize that IL-21 may indirectly regulate H. pylori-specific T cell responses by controlling dendritic cell (DC) functions in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. It was found that IL-21 treatment reduced the ability of dendritic cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to H. pylori. While H. pylori increased the expression of costimulatory proteins on DCs, IL-21 reduced the expression of CD40 in the presence of H. pylori. Also, Th17 recall responses were intact when DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells in the presence of IL-21, but IL-21 did impact the ability of DCs to induce antigen-specific proliferation. These data suggest that IL-21, while proinflammatory in most settings, downregulates the proinflammatory cytokine microenvironment through modulating the cytokine expression of DCs, indirectly modifying IL-17A expression. Understanding how these proinflammatory cytokines are regulated will advance our understanding of how and why H. pylori infection may be tolerated in some individuals while it causes gastritis, ulcers, or cancer in others.

Since dopamine transporter (DAT) is involved in several brain disorders by mod-ulating extracellular dopamine in the central nervous system, this study evaluated the impact of DAT genetic reduction on the morpho-functional integrity of mouse small intestine enteric nervous system (ENS). In DAT heterozygous (DAT+/−) and wild-type (DAT+/+) mice (14 ± 2 weeks) alterations in small intestinal contractility were evaluated by isometrical assessment of neuromuscular responses to receptor and non-receptor-mediated stimuli. Changes in ENS integrity were studied by real-time PCR and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus whole-mount preparations (). DAT genetic reduction resulted in a significant increase in dopamine-mediated effects, primarily via D1 receptor activation, as well as in reduced cholinergic response, sustained by tachykininergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission via NMDA receptors. These functional anomalies were associated to architectural changes in the neurochemical coding and S100β immunoreactivity in small intestine myenteric plexus. Our study provides evidence that genetic-driven DAT defective activity determines anomalies in ENS architecture and neurochemical coding together with ileal dysmotility, highlighting the involvement of dopaminergic system in gut disorders, often associated to neurological conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

"An oral inoculation infant rabbit model for shigella infection","Kuehl CJ, D’gama JD, Warr AR, Waldor MK",2020,"Article","10.1128/mBio.03105-19","Shigella species cause diarrheal disease globally. Shigellosis is typically characterized by bloody stools and colitis with mucosal damage and is the leading bacterial cause of diarrheal death worldwide. After the pathogen is orally ingested, it invades and replicates within the colonic epithelium through mechanisms that rely on its type III secretion system (T3SS). Currently, oral infection-based small animal models to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis are lacking. Here, we found that orogastric inoculation of infant rabbits with Shigella flexneri resulted in diarrhea and colonic pathology resembling that found in human shigellosis. Fasting animals prior to S. flexneri inoculation increased the frequency of disease. The pathogen colonized the colon, where both luminal and intraepithelial foci were observed. The intraepithelial foci likely arise through S. flexneri spreading from cell to cell. Robust S. flexneri intestinal colonization, invasion of the colonic epithelium, and epithelial sloughing all required the T3SS as well as IcsA, a factor required for bacterial spreading and adhesion in vitro. Expression of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), detected with in situ mRNA labeling, was higher in animals infected with wild-type S. flexneri versus mutant strains deficient in icsA or T3SS, suggesting that epithelial invasion promotes expression of this chemokine. Collectively, our findings suggest that oral infection of infant rabbits offers a useful experimental model for studies of the pathogenesis of shigellosis and for testing of new therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Shigella species are the leading bacterial cause of diarrheal death globally. The pathogen causes bacillary dysentery, a bloody diarrheal disease characterized by damage to the colonic mucosa and is usually spread through the fecal-oral route. Small animal models of shigellosis that rely on the oral route of infection are lacking. Here, we found that orogastric inoculation of infant rabbits with S. flexneri led to a diarrheal disease and colonic pathology reminiscent of human shigellosis. Diarrhea, intestinal colonization, and pathology in this model were dependent on the S. flexneri type III secretion system and IcsA, canonical Shigella virulence factors. Thus, oral infection of infant rabbits offers a feasible model to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis and to develop and test new therapeutics. © 2020 Kuehl et al.","animal models; bacillary dysentery; host-pathogen interactions; infant rabbit; pathogenesis; shigella; shigellosis; bacterial protein; interleukin 8; protein icsa; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial colonization; bacterium adherence; bacterium mutant; cell invasion; colon epithelium; controlled study; diarrhea; fasting; female; in vitro study; infant; inoculation; intestine epithelium cell; new zealand white (rabbit); nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; shigella flexneri; shigellosis; strain difference; type iii secretion system; wild type; animal; biopsy; disease model; enterobacteriaceae infection; host pathogen interaction; immunohistochemistry; intestine mucosa; leporidae; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; physiology; shigella; animals; biopsy; diarrhea; disease models, animal; enterobacteriaceae infections; host-pathogen interactions; immunohistochemistry; intestinal mucosa; rabbits; shigella"
"Prescription opioids induce gut dysbiosis and exacerbate colitis in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease","Sharma U, Olson RK, Erhart FN, Zhang L, Meng J, Segura B, Banerjee S, Sharma M, Saluja AK, Ramakrishnan S, Abreu MT, Roy S",2020,"Article","10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjz188","Background and Aims: Opioids are the most prescribed analgesics for pain in inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD]; however, the consequences of opioid use on IBD severity are not well defined. This is the first study investigating consequences of hydromorphone in both dextran sodium sulphate [DSS]-induced colitis and spontaneous colitis (IL-10 knockout [IL-10-/-]) mouse models of IBD. Methods: To determine the consequences of opioids on IBD pathogenesis, wild-type [WT] mice were treated with clinically relevant doses of hydromorphone and colitis was induced via 3% DSS in drinking water for 5 days. In parallel we also determined the consequences of opioids in a spontaneous colitis model. Results: Hydromorphone and DSS independently induced barrier dysfunction, bacterial translocation, disruption of tight junction organisation and increased intestinal and systemic inflammation, which were exacerbated in mice receiving hydromorphone in combination with DSS. Hydromorphone + DSS-treated mice exhibited significant microbial dysbiosis. Predictive metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota revealed high abundance in the bacterial communities associated with virulence, antibiotic resistance, toxin production, and inflammatory properties. Hydromorphone modulates tight junction organisation in a myosin light chain kinase [MLCK]-dependent manner. Treatment with MLCK inhibitor ML-7 ameliorates the detrimental effects of hydromorphone on DSS-induced colitis and thus decreases severity of IBD. Similarly, we demonstrated that hydromorphone treatment in IL-10-/- mice resulted in accelerated clinical manifestations of colitis compared with control mice. Conclusions: Opioids used for pain management in IBD accelerate IBD progression by dysregulation of the gut microbiota, leading to expansion of pathogenic bacteria, translocation of bacteria, immune deregulation and sustained inflammation. © 2019 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).","ibd; microbiome; prescription opioid; 1 (5 iodo 1 naphthalenesulfonyl)hexahydro 1h 1,4 diazepine; antibiotic agent; dextran sulfate; drinking water; hydromorphone; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; myosin light chain kinase; azepine derivative; enzyme inhibitor; hydromorphone; il10 protein, mouse; interleukin 10; myosin light chain kinase; naphthalene derivative; narcotic analgesic agent; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibiotic resistance; article; bacterial translocation; bacterial virulence; colitis; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease severity; dysbiosis; infant; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; male; metagenomics; microbial community; mouse; nonhuman; population abundance; prediction; prescription; priority journal; tight junction; adverse event; analgesia; animal; disease model; drug effect; dysbiosis; genetics; immunology; inflammatory bowel disease; knockout mouse; microbiology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; analgesics, opioid; animals; azepines; disease models, animal; dysbiosis; enzyme inhibitors; gastrointestinal microbiome; hydromorphone; inflammatory bowel diseases; interleukin-10; mice; mice, knockout; myosin-light-chain kinase; naphthalenes; pain management"

During successive generations SPF animals acquire a complex biota, but it is not known how similar it is to natural mouse biota. Therefore, fecal pellets of two feral mice and three SPF mice were studied by small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. After amplification of 16S rDNA by Bacterial Kingdom-specific primers, 132 rDNA clones from feral mice and 219 clones from SPF mice were placed phylogenetically. Forty-four percent of recovered rDNAs from feral mice were from organisms belonging to the Ribosomal Database Project's Bacteroides Group with significant proportions also coming from lactobacilli, the Clostridium coccoides Group and the Clostridium leptum Group. Although the SPF biota appeared equally complex at lower phylogenetic levels, the major phylogenetic groups represented were less diverse in that 92% of rDNA's from SPF mice mapped to groups of clostridia with 79% to the C. coccoides Group alone.

However, the role of the olfactory system has insufficiently been explored in the pathogeneses of PD and Alzheimer disease (AD) in laboratory models. Here, we demonstrate applications of a new method to process mouse heads for microscopy by sectioning, mounting, and staining whole skulls (‘holocranohistochemistry’). This technique permits the visualization of the olfactory system from the nasal cavity to mitral cells and dopamine-producing interneurons of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. We applied this method to two specific goals: first, to visualize PD- and AD-linked gene expression in the olfactory system, where we detected abundant, endogenous α-synuclein and tau expression in the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, we observed amyloid-β plaques and proteinase-K-resistant α-synuclein species, respectively, in cranial nerve-I of APP- and human SNCA-over-expressing mice. The second application of the technique was to the modeling of gene–environment interactions in the nasal cavity of mice. We tracked the infection of a neurotropic respiratory-enteric-orphan virus from the nose pad into cranial nerves-I (and -V) and monitored the ensuing brain infection. Given its abundance in the olfactory epithelia, we questioned whether α-synuclein played a role in innate host defenses to modify the outcome of infections. Indeed, Snca-null mice were more likely to succumb to viral encephalitis versus their wild-type littermates. Moreover, using a bacterial sepsis model, Snca-null mice were less able to control infection after intravenous inoculation with Salmonella typhimurium. Together, holocranohistochemistry enabled new discoveries related to α-synuclein expression and its function in mice. Future studies will address: the role of Mapt and mutant SNCA alleles in infection paradigms; the contribution of xenobiotics in the initiation of idiopathic PD; and the safety to the host when systemically targeting α-synuclein by immunotherapy. © 2017, The Author(s).","alzheimer disease; app/aβ; exposome; genome; histology; infection; inoculation; mapt/tau; neuropathology; parkinson disease; snca/α-synuclein; susceptibility; synucleinopathy; alpha synuclein; amyloid beta protein; dopamine; leucine rich repeat kinase 2; microtubule associated protein; proteinase k; tau protein; alpha synuclein; amyloid precursor protein; app protein, human; snca protein, human; snca protein, mouse; adult; allele; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell inclusion; controlled study; dendrite; gene expression; genotype environment interaction; histochemistry; holocranohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; infection control; innate immunity; interneuron; mesencephalon; mitral cell; mouse; neostriatum; nonhuman; nose cavity; nose infection; olfactory bulb; olfactory epithelium; olfactory nerve; olfactory receptor neuron; priority journal; protein expression; reoviridae; reovirus infection; salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium; salmonellosis; substantia nigra; trigeminal nerve; 129 mouse; anatomy and histology; animal; brain; c57bl mouse; diagnostic imaging; disease model; female; genetics; head; human; immunohistochemistry; immunology; male; mammalian orthoreovirus 3; metabolism; mortality; nerve tract; olfactory mucosa; pathology; procedures; tissue preservation; transgenic mouse; virology; virus encephalitis; alpha-synuclein; amyloid beta-protein precursor; animals; brain; disease models, animal; encephalitis, viral; female; head; humans; immunohistochemistry; male; mammalian orthoreovirus 3; mice; mice, 129 strain; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, transgenic; neural pathways; olfactory mucosa; olfactory receptor neurons; reoviridae infections; salmonella infections; salmonella typhimurium; tissue preservation"
"Disruption of tumour-associated macrophage trafficking by the osteopontin-induced colony-stimulating factor-1 signalling sensitises hepatocellular carcinoma to anti-PD-L1 blockade","Zhu Y, Yang J, Xu D, Gao X-M, Zhang Z, Hsu JL, Li C-W, Lim S-O, Sheng Y-Y, Zhang Y, Li J-H, Luo Q, Zheng Y, Zhao Y, Lu L, Jia H-L, Hung M-C, Dong Q-Z, Qin L-X",2019,"Article","10.1136/gutjnl-2019-318419","Objective: In the tumour microenvironment, critical drivers of immune escape include the oncogenic activity of the tumour cell-intrinsic osteopontin (OPN), the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the expansion of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). We investigated the feasibility of targeting these pathways as a therapeutic option in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models. Design: We analysed the number of tumour-infiltrating immune cells and the inflammatory immune profiles in chemically induced liver tumour isolated from wild-type and OPNknockout (KO) mice. In vitro cell cocultures were further conducted to investigate the crosstalk between TAMs and HCC cells mediated by OPN, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) and CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). The in vivo efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and CSF1/CSF1R inhibition was evaluated in OPN overexpressing subcutaneous or orthotopic mouse model of HCC. Results: The numbers of TAMs, as well as the expression levels of M2 macrophage markers and PD-L1 were significantly decreased, but the levels of cytokines produced by T-helper 1 (Th1) cells were upregulated in tumour tissues from OPN KO mice compared with that from the controls. In addition, we observed a positive association between the OPN and PD-L1 expression, and OPN expression and TAM infiltration in tumour tissues from patients with HCC. We further demonstrated that OPN facilitates chemotactic migration, and alternative activation of macrophages, and promotes the PD-L1 expression in HCC via activation of the CSF1-CSF1R pathway in macrophages. Combining anti-PD-L1 and CSF1R inhibition elicited potent antitumour activity and prolonged survival of OPNhigh tumour-bearing mice. Histological, flow cytometric and ELISA revealed increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, reduced TAMs and enhanced Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in multiple mouse models of HCC. Conclusions: OPN/CSF1/CSF1R axis plays a critical role in the immunosuppressive nature of the HCC microenvironment. Blocking CSF1/CSF1R prevents TAM trafficking and thereby enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of HCC. © 2019 Author(s).","anti-pd-l1; hepatocellular carcinoma; immune checkpoint blockade; tumor microenvironment; osteopontin; pexidartinib; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 ligand 1 antibody; unclassified drug; aminopyridine derivative; antineoplastic agent; cd274 protein, mouse; colony stimulating factor 1; cytokine; osteopontin; pexidartinib; programmed death 1 ligand 1; pyrrole derivative; spp1 protein, mouse; tumor marker; adjuvant therapy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; article; cancer infiltration; cancer inhibition; cancer tissue; cell activation; cell disruption; cell infiltration; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; th1 cell; tumor associated leukocyte; upregulation; animal; biosynthesis; chemotaxis; gene deletion; genetics; immunology; knockout mouse; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; macrophage; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; procedures; prognosis; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor cell culture; tumor escape; tumor microenvironment; aminopyridines; animals; antineoplastic combined chemotherapy protocols; b7-h1 antigen; biomarkers, tumor; carcinoma, hepatocellular; chemotaxis; cytokines; gene deletion; humans; liver neoplasms; lymphocytes, tumor-infiltrating; macrophage colony-stimulating factor; macrophages; male; mice, knockout; molecular targeted therapy; osteopontin; prognosis; pyrroles; tumor cells, cultured; tumor escape; tumor microenvironment"

This variation may ultimately impact host ecology by altering nutritional status and health. Wild animal populations provide an excellent opportunity for understanding these interactions. However, compared to clinical studies, microbial research targeting wild animals is currently limited, and many published studies focus only on a single population of a single host species. In this study we utilize fecal samples from two species of howler monkey (Alouatta pigra and A. palliata) collected at four sites to investigate factors influencing the gut microbiota at three scales: taxonomic (host species), ecosystemic (forest type), and local (habitat disturbance/season). The results demonstrate that the effect of host species on the gut microbiota is stronger than the effect of host forest type, which is stronger than the effect of habitat disturbance or seasonality. Nevertheless, within host species, gut microbiota composition differs in response to forest type, habitat disturbance, and season. Variations in the effect size of these factors are associated both with host species and environment. This information may be beneficial for understanding ecological and evolutionary questions associated with Mesoamerican howler monkeys, as well as determining conservation challenges facing each species. These mechanisms may also provide insight into the ecology of other species of howler monkeys, non-human primates, and mammals. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","alouatta; disturbance; habitat; microbiome; season; diet; digestive system; environmental disturbance; environmental effect; environmental factor; feces; forest; host; microbial community; nutritional status; phylogenetics; primate; seasonality; alouatta; alouatta palliata; alouatta pigra; animalia; mammalia; primates; alouatta; animal; diet; ecosystem; feces; forest; intestine flora; microbiology; phylogeny; season; alouatta; animals; diet; ecosystem; feces; forests; gastrointestinal microbiome; phylogeny; seasons"

Therefore, efforts have been made to understand how wildlife can rebound from anthropogenic disturbances. An essential mechanism to adapt to environmental and social changes is the fluctuations in the host gut microbiome. Here we give a comprehensive description of anthropogenically induced microbiome alterations in Asian elephants (n = 30). We detected gut microbial changes due to overseas translocation, captivity and deworming. We found that microbes belonging to Planococcaceae had the highest contribution in the microbiome alterations after translocation, while Clostridiaceae, Spirochaetaceae and Bacteroidia were the most affected after captivity. However, deworming significantly changed the abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Weeksellaceae and Burkholderiaceae. These findings may provide fundamental ideas to help guide the preservation tactics and probiotic replacement therapies of a dysbiosed gut microbiome in Asian elephants. More generally, these results show the severity of anthropogenic activities at the level of gut microbiome, altering the adaptation processes to new environments and the subsequent capability to maintain normal physiological processes in animals. © 2021, The Author(s).","; adaptation; animal; asia; dysbiosis; ecosystem; elephant; environmental monitoring; female; intestine flora; male; microbiology; pathophysiology; procedures; adaptation, physiological; animals; asia; dysbiosis; ecosystem; elephants; environmental monitoring; female; gastrointestinal microbiome; male"

Among a variety of different feeding patterns, breastfeeding represents the best modality. In fact, the capacity of breast milk to modulate the composition of infants' gut microbiota leads to beneficial effects on their health. In this study, we used newborn mice as a model to evaluate the effect of parental genetic background (i.e., IgAproducing mice and IgA-deficient mice) and feeding modulation (i.e., maternal feeding and cross-feeding) on the onset and shaping of gut microbiota after birth. To investigate these topics, we used either a culturomic approach that employed Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MS), or bottom-up Liquid Chromatography, with subsequent MSMS shotgun metaproteomic analysis that compared and assembled results of the two techniques. We found that the microbial community was enriched by lactic acid bacteria when pups were breastfed by wild-type (WT) mothers, while IgA-deficient milk led to an increase in the opportunistic bacterial pathogen (OBP) population. Cross-feeding results suggested that IgA supplementation promoted the exclusion of some OBPs and the temporary appearance of beneficial species in pups fed by WT foster mothers. Our results show that both techniques yield a picture of microbiota from different angles and with varying depths.

"Dietary purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) promotes the growth performance of broilers by modulation of gut microbiota","Wang C, Liu Q, Ye F, Tang H, Xiong Y, Wu Y, Wang L, Feng X, Zhang S, Wan Y, Huang J",2021,"Article","10.1186/s13568-021-01190-z","Purslane is a widespread wild vegetable with both medicinal and edible properties. It is highly appreciated for its high nutritional value and is also considered as a high-quality feed resource for livestock and poultry. In this study, Sanhuang broilers were used to investigate the effect of feeding purslane diets on the growth performance in broilers and their gut microbiota. A total of 48 birds with good growth and uniform weight were selected and randomly allocated to four treatment groups A (control), B, C and D. Dietary treatments were fed with basal diet without purslane and diets containing 1%, 2% and 3% purslane. The 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform to analyze the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in the four sets of samples. The results showed that dietary inclusion of 2% and 3% purslane could significantly improve the growth performance and reduce the feed conversion ratio. Microbial diversity analysis indicated that the composition of gut microbiota of Sanhuang broilers mainly included Gallibacterium, Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella, etc. As the content of purslane was increased, the abundance of Lactobacillus increased significantly, and Escherichia-Shigella decreased. LEfSe analysis revealed that Bacteroides_caecigallinarum, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillales and Firmicutes had significant differences compared with the control group. PICRUSt analysis revealed bacteria mainly enriched in carbohydrate metabolism pathway due to the additon of purslane in the diet. These results suggest that the addition of purslane to feed could increase the abundance of Lactobacillus in intestine, modulate the environment of gut microbiota and promote the metabolism of carbohydrates to improve its growth performance. This study indicates that the effect of purslane on the growth-promoting performance of broilers might depend on its modulation on gut microbiota, so as to provide a certain scientific basis for the application of purslane in the feed industry. © 2021, The Author(s).","carbohydrate metabolism; growth performance; gut microbiota; purslane; sanhuang broilers; dna 16s; growth promotor; portulaca oleracea extract; article; bacteroidaceae; bacteroides; bacteroides caecigallinarum; broiler; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; diet supplementation; discriminant analysis; dna extraction; effect size; feces microflora; feed conversion ratio; feeding; food intake; gallibacterium; gene expression; growth; growth performance; high throughput sequencing; histogram; illumina sequencing; intestine flora; lachnospiraceae; lactobacillales; livestock; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; nutritional value; operational taxonomic unit; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; portulaca oleracea; poultry; shigella; taxonomy"

Accumulating evidence suggests that this barrier is impaired in sepsis, aggravating systemic inflammation. Previous studies reported that cathelicidin is differentially expressed in various tissues in sepsis. However, its role in sepsis-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction has not been investigated. Design: To examine the role of cathelicidin in polymicrobial sepsis, cathelicidin wild-(Cnlp +/+) and knockout (Cnlp -/-) mice underwent cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) followed by the assessment of septic mortality and morbidity as well as histological, biochemical, immunological, and transcriptomic analyses in the ileal tissues. We also evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies of vitamin D3 (an inducer of endogenous cathelicidin) in the CLP-induced murine polymicrobial sepsis model. Results: The ileal expression of cathelicidin was increased by three-fold after CLP, peaking at 4 h. Knockout of Cnlp significantly increased 7-day mortality and was associated with a higher murine sepsis score. Alcian-blue staining revealed a reduced number of mucin-positive goblet cells, accompanied by reduced mucin expression. Increased number of apoptotic cells and cleavage of caspase-3 were observed. Cnlp deletion increased intestinal permeability to 4kD fluorescein-labeled dextran and reduced the expression of tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin. Notably, circulating bacterial DNA load increased more than two-fold. Transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of cytokine/inflammatory pathway. Depletion of Cnlp induced more M1 macrophages and neutrophils compared with the wild-type mice after CLP. Mice pre-treated with cholecalciferol (an inactive form of vitamin D3) or treated with 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (an active form of VD3) had decreased 7-day mortality and significantly less severe symptoms. Intriguingly, the administration of cholecalciferol after CLP led to worsened 7-day mortality and the associated symptoms. Conclusions: Endogenous cathelicidin promotes intestinal barrier integrity accompanied by modulating the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in polymicrobial sepsis. Our data suggested that 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 but not cholecalciferol is a potential therapeutic agent for treating sepsis. © 2020 The Author(s).","antimicrobial peptide; bacterial translocation; ll-37; sepsis; bacterial dna; calcitriol; caspase 3; cathelicidin; claudin 1; colecalciferol; mucin; occludin; tight junction protein; transcriptome; 25-hydroxyvitamin d; antimicrobial cationic peptide; cap18 lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; vitamin d; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis; controlled study; drug effect; ileum tissue; infection prevention; intestine epithelium; intestine epithelium cell; intestine mucosa permeability; macrophage; male; morbidity; mortality; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; transcriptomics; upregulation; animal; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; sepsis; animals; antimicrobial cationic peptides; intestinal mucosa; macrophages; male; mice; mice, knockout; neutrophils; sepsis; vitamin d"

Translocation of microbiota-derived products from an impaired gut barrier contributes to the development of obesity-associated tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the critical role of CRIg+ macrophages in clearing microbiota-derived products from the bloodstream in the context of obesity is largely unknown. Methods: We performed studies with CRIg–/–, C3–/–, cGAS–/–, and their wild-type littermate mice. The CRIg+ macrophage population and bacterial DNA abundance were examined in both mouse and human liver by either flow cytometric or immunohistochemistry analysis. Gut microbial DNA–containing extracellular vesicles (mEVs) were adoptively transferred into CRIg–/–, C3–/–, or wild-type mice, and tissue inflammation and insulin sensitivity were measured in these mice. After coculture with gut mEVs, cellular insulin responses and cGAS/STING-mediated inflammatory responses were evaluated. Results: Gut mEVs can reach metabolic tissues in obesity. Liver CRIg+ macrophages efficiently clear mEVs from the bloodstream through a C3-dependent opsonization mechanism, whereas obesity elicits a marked reduction in the CRIg+ macrophage population. Depletion of CRIg+ cells results in the spread of mEVs into distant metabolic tissues, subsequently exacerbating tissue inflammation and metabolic disorders. Additionally, in vitro treatment of obese mEVs directly triggers inflammation and insulin resistance of insulin target cells. Depletion of microbial DNA blunts the pathogenic effects of intestinal EVs. Furthermore, the cGAS/STING pathway is crucial for microbial DNA–mediated inflammatory responses. Conclusions: Deficiency of CRIg+ macrophages and leakage of intestinal EVs containing microbial DNA contribute to the development of obesity-associated tissue inflammation and metabolic diseases. © 2021 AGA Institute","extracellular vesicle; microbial dna; obesity; tissue inflammation; bacterial dna; complement component c3; complement receptor; complement receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily; insulin; rna 16s; unclassified drug; bacterial dna; cgas protein, mouse; complement component c3; complement receptor; membrane protein; nucleotidyltransferase; sting1 protein, mouse; vsig4 protein, mouse; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; circulation; coculture; controlled study; epididymis fat; exosome; flow cytometry; gluconeogenesis; glucose tolerance; glucose transport; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; insulin resistance; insulin response; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; liver; macrophage; metabolic disorder; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; opsonization; priority journal; target cell; adverse event; animal; blood; complication; cytology; disease model; exosome; genetics; hepatitis; immunology; insulin resistance; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; kupffer cell; lipid diet; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; signal transduction; animals; complement c3; diet, high-fat; disease models, animal; dna, bacterial; extracellular vesicles; gastrointestinal microbiome; hepatitis; humans; insulin resistance; intestinal mucosa; kupffer cells; liver; membrane proteins; mice; mice, knockout; nucleotidyltransferases; obesity; receptors, complement; signal transduction"

Wildlife populations, including deer, may serve as reservoirs of parasitic diseases for both humans and domestic animals, either through direct contact or through contamination of food or water resources. However, no studies of the occurrence and subtype distribution of Blastocystis in wildlife populations have been conducted in the United States. PCR and next generation amplicon sequencing were used to determine the occurrence and subtypes of Blastocystis in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Blastocystis was common, with 88.8% (71/80) of samples found to be positive. Twelve subtypes were identified, ten previously reported (ST1, ST3, ST4, ST10, ST14, ST21, and ST23–ST26) and two novel subtypes (ST30 and ST31). To confirm the validity of ST30 and ST31, MinION sequencing was used to obtain full‐length SSU rRNA gene sequences, and phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses were performed. ST10, ST14, and ST24 were the most commonly observed subtypes. Potentially zoonotic subtypes ST1, ST3, or ST4 were present in 8.5% of Blastocystis‐positives. Mixed subtype infections were common (90.1% of Blastocystis‐positives). This study is the first to subtype Blastocystis in white‐tailed deer. White‐tailed deer were found to be commonly infected/colonized with a wide diversity of subtypes, including two novel subtypes, zoonotic subtypes, and subtypes frequently reported in domestic animals.

"Microbiome assembly of avian eggshells and their potential as transgenerational carriers of maternal microbiota","Van Veelen HPJ, Salles JF, Tieleman BI",2018,"Article","10.1038/s41396-018-0067-3","The microbiome is essential for development, health and homeostasis throughout an animal's life. Yet, the origins and transmission processes governing animal microbiomes remain elusive for non-human vertebrates, oviparous vertebrates in particular. Eggs may function as transgenerational carriers of the maternal microbiome, warranting characterisation of egg microbiome assembly. Here, we investigated maternal and environmental contributions to avian eggshell microbiota in wild passerine birds: woodlark Lullula arborea and skylark Alauda arvensis. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we demonstrated in both lark species, at the population and within-nest levels, that bacterial communities of freshly laid eggs were distinct from the female cloacal microbiome. Instead, soil-borne bacteria appeared to thrive on freshly laid eggs, and eggshell microbiota composition strongly resembled maternal skin, body feather and nest material communities, sources in direct contact with laid eggs. Finally, phylogenetic structure analysis and microbial source tracking underscored species sorting from directly contacting sources rather than in vivo-transferred symbionts. The female-egg-nest system allowed an integrative assessment of avian egg microbiome assembly, revealing mixed modes of symbiont acquisition not previously documented for vertebrate eggs. Our findings illuminated egg microbiome origins, which suggested a limited potential of eggshells for transgenerational transmission, encouraging further investigation of eggshell microbiome functions in vertebrates. © 2018 International Society for Microbial Ecology.","; community composition; eggshell; gene; gene expression; homeostasis; microbial community; microorganism; passerine; phylogenetics; symbiont; vertebrate; alauda arvensis; animalia; aves; bacteria (microorganisms); lullula arborea; passeriformes; vertebrata; rna 16s; animal; bacterium; classification; egg shell; female; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; passeriformes; phylogeny; animals; bacteria; egg shell; female; microbiota; passeriformes; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal, 16s"
"Role of TH17 responses in increasing herpetic keratitis in the eyes of mice infected with HSV-1","Hirose S, Jaggi U, Wang S, Tormanen K, Nagaoka Y, Katsumata M, Ghiasi H",2020,"Article","10.1167/IOVS.61.6.20","PURPOSE. TH17 cells play an important role in host defense and autoimmunity yet very little is known about the role of IL17 in herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infectivity. To better understand the relationship between IL17 and HSV-1 infection, we assessed the relative impact of IL17A-deficiency and deficiency of its receptors on HSV-1 responses in vivo. METHODS. We generated IL17RA−/− and IL17RA−/−RC−/− mice in-house and infected them along with IL17A−/− and IL17RC−/− mice in the eyes with 2 × 105 PFU/eye of wild type (WT) HSV-1 strain McKrae. WT C57BL/6 mice were used as control. Virus replication in the eye, survival, corneal scarring (CS), angiogenesis, levels of latency-reactivation, and levels of CD8 and exhaustion markers (PD1, TIM3, LAG3, CTLA4, CD244, and CD39) in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) of infected mice were determined on day 28 postinfection. RESULTS. No significant differences in virus replication in the eye, survival, latency, reactivation, and exhaustion markers were detected among IL17A−/−, IL17RA−/−, IL17RC−/−, IL17RA−/−RC−/−, and WT mice. However, mice lacking IL17 had significantly less CS and angiogenesis than WT mice. In addition, angiogenesis levels in the absence of IL17RC and irrespective of the absence of IL17RA were significantly less than in IL17A- or IL17RAdeficient mice. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that the absence of IL17 protects against HSV-1-induced eye disease, but has no role in protecting against virus replication, latency, or reactivation. In addition, our data provide rationale for blocking IL17RC function rather than IL17A or IL17RA function as a key driver of HSV-1-induced eye disease.

"Inflammation-induced acid tolerance genes gadab in luminal commensal escherichia coli attenuate experimental colitis","Tchaptchet S, Fan T-J, Goeser L, Schoenborn A, Gulati AS, R Sartor B, Hansena JJ",2013,"Article","10.1128/IAI.00355-13","Dysregulated immune responses to commensal intestinal bacteria, including Escherichia coli, contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and experimental colitis. Reciprocally, E. coli responds to chronic intestinal inflammation by upregulating expression of stress response genes, including gadA and gadB. GadAB encode glutamate decarboxylase and protect E. coli from the toxic effects of low pH and fermentation acids, factors present in the intestinal lumen in patients with active IBDs. We hypothesized that E. coli upregulates gadAB during inflammation to enhance its survival and virulence. Using realtime PCR, we determined gadAB expression in luminal E. coli from ex-germfree wild-type (WT) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) knockout (KO) (IL-10-/-) mice selectively colonized with a commensal E. coli isolate (NC101) that causes colitis in KO mice in isolation or in combination with 7 other commensal intestinal bacterial strains. E. coli survival and host inflammatory responses were measured in WT and KO mice colonized with NC101 or a mutant lacking the gadAB genes (NC101δgadAB). The susceptibility of NC101 and NC101δgadAB to killing by host antimicrobial peptides and their translocation across intestinal epithelial cells were evaluated using bacterial killing assays and transwell experiments, respectively. We show that expression of gadAB in luminal E. coli increases proportionately with intestinal inflammation in KO mice and enhances the susceptibility of NC101 to killing by the host antimicrobial peptide cryptdin-4 but decreases bacterial transmigration across intestinal epithelial cells, colonic inflammation, and mucosal immune responses.

"The oral bacterial community in melanophryniscus admirabilis (Admirable red-belly toads): Implications for conservation","Mann MB, Prichula J, de Castro ÍMS, Severo JM, Abadie M, Lima TMDF, Caorsi V, Borges-Martins M, Frazzon J, Frazzon APG",2021,"Article","10.3390/microorganisms9020220","Melanophryniscus admirabilis (admirable red-belly toad) is a microendemic and critically endangered species found exclusively along 700 m of the Forqueta River, in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. One of the greatest concerns regarding the conservation of this species is the extensive use of pesticides in areas surrounding their natural habitat. In recent years, the adaptation and persistence of animal species in human-impacted environments have been associated with microbiota. Therefore, the present study aimed to characterize the oral bacterial community of wild M. admirabilis and to address the question of how this community might contribute to this toad’s adaptation in the anthropogenic environment as well as its general metabolic capabilities. A total of 11 oral samples collected from wild M. admirabilis were characterized and analyzed via high-throughput sequencing. Fragments of the 16S rRNA variable region 4 (V4) were amplified, and sequencing was conducted using an Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) System with 316 chips. A total of 181,350 sequences were obtained, resulting in 16 phyla, 34 classes, 39 orders, and 77 families. Proteobacteria dominated (53%) the oral microbiota of toads, followed by Firmicutes (18%), Bac-teroidetes (17%), and Actinobacteria (5%). No significant differences in microbial community profile from among the samples were reported, which suggests that the low dietary diversity observed in this population may directly influence the bacterial composition. Inferences of microbiome function were performed using PICRUSt2 software. Important pathways (e.g., xenobiotic degradation pathways for pesticides and aromatic phenolic compounds) were detected, which suggests that the bacterial communities may serve important roles in M. admirabilis health and survival in the anthropogenic environment. Overall, our results have important implications for the conservation and management of this microendemic and critically endangered species. © 2021 by the authors.

"Small to modest impact of social group on the gut microbiome of wild Costa Rican capuchins in a seasonal forest","Orkin JD, Webb SE, Melin AD",2019,"Article","10.1002/ajp.22985","The horizontal transmission of pathogenic and beneficial microbes has implications for health and development of socially living animals. Social group is repeatedly implicated as an important predictor of gut microbiome structure among primates, with individuals in neighboring social groups exhibiting distinct microbiomes. Here we examine whether group membership is a predictor of gut microbiome structure and diversity across three groups of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) inhabiting a seasonal Costa Rican forest. We collected 62 fecal samples from 18 adult females during four sampling bouts. Sampling bouts spanned the dry-to-wet-to-dry seasonal transitions. To investigate gut microbial composition, we sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We used the DADA2 pipeline to assign amplicon sequence variants and the RDP database to classify taxa. Our findings are: 1) gut microbiomes of capuchins clustered by social group in the late dry season, but this pattern was less evident in other sampling bouts; 2) social group was a significant variable in a PERMANOVA test of beta diversity, but it accounted for less variation than season; 3) social group was not an important predictor of abundance for the ten most abundant microbial taxa in capuchins; 4) when examining log2-fold abundances of microbes between social groups, there were significant differences in some pairwise comparisons. While this is suggestive of group-wide differences, individual variation may have a strong impact and should be assessed in future studies. Overall, we found a minor impact of social group membership on the gut microbiota of wild white-faced capuchins. Future research including home range overlap and resource use, as well as fine-scale investigation of individual variation, will further elucidate patterns of socially structured microbes. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","16s sequencing; cebus; dry forest; seasonality; sociality; database; digestive system; dry forest; forest ecosystem; genetic analysis; microorganism; parasite transmission; primate; seasonality; wild population; costa rica; animalia; cebus; cebus capucinus; primates; rna 16s; animal; biodiversity; cebus; costa rica; dna sequence; feces; female; forest; homing behavior; intestine flora; microbiology; season; social environment; animals; biodiversity; cebus; costa rica; feces; female; forests; gastrointestinal microbiome; homing behavior; rna, ribosomal, 16s; seasons; sequence analysis, dna; social environment"
"Colonization of the tsetse fly midgut with commensal Kosakonia cowanii Zambiae inhibits trypanosome infection establishment","Weiss BL, Maltz MA, Vigneron A, Wu Y, Walter KS, O’Neill MB, Wang J, Aksoy S",2019,"Article","10.1371/journal.ppat.1007470","Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) vector pathogenic trypanosomes (Trypanosoma spp.) in sub-Saharan Africa. These parasites cause human and animal African trypanosomiases, which are debilitating diseases that inflict an enormous socio-economic burden on inhabitants of endemic regions. Current disease control strategies rely primarily on treating infected animals and reducing tsetse population densities. However, relevant programs are costly, labor intensive and difficult to sustain. As such, novel strategies aimed at reducing tsetse vector competence require development. Herein we investigated whether Kosakonia cowanii Zambiae (Kco_Z), which confers Anopheles gambiae with resistance to Plasmodium, is able to colonize tsetse and induce a trypanosome refractory phenotype in the fly. Kco_Z established stable infections in tsetse’s gut and exhibited no adverse effect on the fly’s survival. Flies with established Kco_Z infections in their gut were significantly more refractory to infection with two distinct trypanosome species (T. congolense, 6% infection; T. brucei, 32% infection) than were age-matched flies that did not house the exogenous bacterium (T. congolense, 36% infected; T. brucei, 70% infected). Additionally, 52% of Kco_Z colonized tsetse survived infection with entomopathogenic Serratia marcescens, compared with only 9% of their wild-type counterparts. These parasite and pathogen refractory phenotypes result from the fact that Kco_Z acidifies tsetse’s midgut environment, which inhibits trypanosome and Serratia growth and thus infection establishment. Finally, we determined that Kco_Z infection does not impact the fecundity of male or female tsetse, nor the ability of male flies to compete with their wild-type counterparts for mates. We propose that Kco_Z could be used as one component of an integrated strategy aimed at reducing the ability of tsetse to transmit pathogenic trypanosomes. © 2019 Weiss et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.","; ascorbic acid; cysteine; peptidoglycan recognition protein; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anopheles gambiae; antibacterial activity; article; bacterial load; blood flow; cell proliferation assay; clinical effectiveness; colony forming unit; controlled study; disease predisposition; drosophila; economics; female; fitness; fluorescence; genotype phenotype correlation; glossinidae; health program; immune system; male; microbial colonization; microscopy; nonhuman; ph; plasmodium; population; probability; semen analysis; serratia infection; survival analysis; trypanosomiasis; africa south of the sahara; african trypanosomiasis; animal; anopheles; enterobacteriaceae; glossinidae; human; metabolism; microbiology; mosquito vector; parasitology; pathogenicity; symbiosis; trypanosoma brucei brucei; trypanosoma congolense; adult; africa south of the sahara; animals; anopheles; enterobacteriaceae; female; humans; male; mosquito vectors; symbiosis; trypanosoma brucei brucei; trypanosoma congolense; trypanosomiasis, african; tsetse flies"
"Early life stress in mice is a suitable model for Irritable Bowel Syndrome but does not predispose to colitis nor increase susceptibility to enteric infections","Riba A, Olier M, Lacroix-Lamandé S, Lencina C, Bacquié V, Harkat C, Van Langendonck N, Gillet M, Cartier C, Baron M, Sommer C, Mallet V, Zill M, Robert H, Laurent F, Ellero-Simatos S, Théodorou V, Ménard S",2018,"Article","10.1016/j.bbi.2018.05.024","Neonatal period is characterized by an immature intestinal barrier. Scattered evidence suggests that early life stressful events induce long lasting alterations of intestinal homeostasis mimicking Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Those observations highlighting defect of intestinal barrier by early life stress questioned its potential role as a risk factor for gastrointestinal disorders such as colitis and infections. In this study, we aimed to analyze if maternal separation (MS) in mice mimicks IBS main features. We next addressed whether MS could trigger or exacerbate colitis in genetically predisposed mice and/or enhance susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections in wild type mice. MS induced main features of IBS in adult wild type male mice i.e. intestinal hyperpermeability, visceral hypersensitivity, microbiota dysbiosis, bile acid malabsorption and low grade inflammation in intestine associated with a defect of Paneth cells and the ILC3 population. This breach in mucosal barrier functions in adults was associated with a systemic IgG response against commensal E. coli and increased IFNγ secretion by splenocytes. However, in IL10 −/− mice, MS did not trigger nor worsen colitis. Furthermore, wild type mice submitted to MS did not show increase susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections (S. Typhimurium, L. monocytogenes or T. gondii) compared to controls. Altogether, our results identify MS in mice as a good experimental model for IBS mimicking all the main features. In addition, early life stress, even though it has long lasting consequences on intestinal homeostasis, does not constitute a facilitating factor to colitis in predisposed individuals nor to gastrointestinal infections in wild type mice. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","humoral and cellular response toward microbiota; innate and adaptive immune responses; maternal separation; pro-inflammatory t cell response; bile acid; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin a; immunoglobulin g; interleukin 10; lysozyme; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; c3h/he mouse; c57bl 6 mouse; cell population; clinical feature; colitis; controlled study; disease predisposition; dysbiosis; early life stress; escherichia coli; feces microflora; female; ilc3 cell; immune response; in vivo study; intestine cell; intestine infection; intestine mucosa permeability; irritable colon; lymphocyte function; malabsorption; male; maternal deprivation; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; paneth cell; priority journal; protein expression; protein secretion; risk assessment; risk factor; spleen cell; t lymphocyte; wild type mouse; animal; c3h mouse; c57bl mouse; colitis; disease model; gastrointestinal disease; genetic predisposition; genetics; inflammation; intestine; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; irritable colon; mental stress; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; pathogenicity; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; animals; colitis; disease models, animal; dysbiosis; escherichia coli; gastrointestinal diseases; gastrointestinal microbiome; genetic predisposition to disease; inflammation; intestinal mucosa; intestines; irritable bowel syndrome; male; maternal deprivation; mice; mice, inbred c3h; mice, inbred c57bl; microbiota; stress, psychological"
"The Gut Microbiota Appears to Compensate for Seasonal Diet Variation in the Wild Black Howler Monkey (Alouatta pigra)","Amato KR, Leigh SR, Kent A, Mackie RI, Yeoman CJ, Stumpf RM, Wilson BA, Nelson KE, White BA, Garber PA",2015,"Article","10.1007/s00248-014-0554-7","For most mammals, including nonhuman primates, diet composition varies temporally in response to differences in food availability. Because diet influences gut microbiota composition, it is likely that the gut microbiota of wild mammals varies in response to seasonal changes in feeding patterns. Such variation may affect host digestive efficiency and, ultimately, host nutrition. In this study, we investigate the temporal variation in diet and gut microbiota composition and function in two groups (N = 13 individuals) of wild Mexican black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) over a 10-month period in Palenque National Park, Mexico. Temporal changes in the relative abundances of individual bacterial taxa were strongly correlated with changes in host diet. For example, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was highest during periods when energy intake was lowest, and the relative abundance of Butyricicoccus was highest when young leaves and unripe fruit accounted for 68 % of the diet. Additionally, the howlers exhibited increased microbial production of energy during periods of reduced energy intake from food sources. Because we observed few changes in howler activity and ranging patterns during the course of our study, we propose that shifts in the composition and activity of the gut microbiota provided additional energy and nutrients to compensate for changes in diet. Energy and nutrient production by the gut microbiota appears to provide an effective buffer against seasonal fluctuations in energy and nutrient intake for these primates and is likely to have a similar function in other mammal species. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","alouatta; gut microbiome; nutrition; seasonality; alouatta; animal; diet; feeding behavior; female; fruit; gastrointestinal tract; male; mexico; microbiology; microflora; plant leaf; season; veterinary; alouatta; animals; diet; feeding behavior; female; fruit; gastrointestinal tract; male; mexico; microbiota; plant leaves; seasons"

"Evaluating the maintenance of disease-associated variation at the blood group-related gene B4galnt2 in house mice","Vallier M, Abou Chakra M, Hindersin L, Linnenbrink M, Traulsen A, Baines JF",2017,"Article","10.1186/s12862-017-1035-7","Background: B4galnt2 is a blood group-related glycosyltransferase that displays cis-regulatory variation for its tissue-specific expression patterns in house mice. The wild type allele, found e.g. in the C57BL/6 J strain, directs intestinal expression of B4galnt2, which is the pattern observed among vertebrates, including humans. An alternative allele class found in the RIIIS/J strain and other mice instead drives expression in blood vessels, which leads to a phenotype similar to type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD), a common human bleeding disorder. We previously showed that alternative B4galnt2 alleles are subject to long-term balancing selection in mice and that variation in B4galnt2 expression influences host-microbe interactions in the intestine. This suggests that the costs of prolonged bleeding in RIIIS/J allele-bearing mice might be outweighed by benefits associated with resistance against gastrointestinal pathogens. However, the conditions under which such trade-offs could lead to the long-term maintenance of disease-associated variation at B4galnt2 are unclear. Results: To explore the persistence of B4galnt2 alleles in wild populations of house mice, we combined B4galnt2 haplotype frequency data together with a mathematical model based on an evolutionary game framework with a modified Wright-Fisher process. In particular, given the potential for a heterozygote advantage as a possible explanation for balancing selection, we focused on heterozygous mice, which express B4galnt2 in both blood vessels and the gastrointestinal tract. We show that B4galnt2 displays an interesting spatial allelic distribution in Western Europe, likely due to the recent action of natural selection. Moreover, we found that the genotype frequencies observed in nature can be produced by pathogen-driven selection when both heterozygotes and RIIIS/J homozygotes are protected against infection and the fitness cost of bleeding is roughly half that of infection. Conclusion: By comparing the results of our models to the patterns of polymorphism at B4galnt2 in natural populations, we are able to recognize the long-term maintenance of the RIIIS/J allele through host-pathogen interactions as a viable hypothesis. Further, our models identify that a putative dominant-, yet unknown protective function of the RIIIS/J allele appears to be more likely than a protective loss of intestinal B4galnt2 expression in RIIIS/J homozygotes. © 2017 The Author(s).","b4galnt2; balancing selection; blood group; evolutionary game theory; host-pathogen interaction; trade-off; wright-fisher process; allele; blood; evolutionary theory; gene; gene expression; genotype; host-pathogen interaction; natural selection; pathogen; phenotype; rodent; wild population; western europe; mus; mus musculus; vertebrata; beta-1,4-n-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 2; blood group antigen; n acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; allele; animal; biological model; c57bl mouse; computer simulation; diseases; europe; gene frequency; genetics; heterozygote; human; mutation; alleles; animals; blood group antigens; computer simulation; disease; europe; gene frequency; heterozygote; humans; mice, inbred c57bl; models, genetic; mutation; n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases"
"Helicobacter pylori VacA targets myeloid cells in the gastric lamina propria to promote peripherally induced regulatory T-cell differentiation and persistent infection","Altobelli A, Bauer M, Velez K, Cover TL, Müller A",2019,"Article","10.1128/mBio.00261-19","The gastric bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes a persistent infection that is directly responsible for gastric ulcers and gastric cancer in some patients and protective against allergic and other immunological disorders in others. The two outcomes of the Helicobacter-host interaction can be modeled in mice that are infected as immunocompetent adults and as neonates, respectively. Here, we have investigated the contribution of the Helicobacter immunomodulator VacA to H. pylorispecific local and systemic immune responses in both models. We found that neonatally infected mice are colonized at higher levels than mice infected as adults and fail to generate effector T-cell responses to the bacteria; rather, T-cell responses in neonatally infected mice are skewed toward Foxp3-positive (Foxp3+) regulatory T cells that are neuropilin negative and express RORγt. We found these peripherally induced regulatory T cells (pTregs) to be enriched, in a VacA-dependent manner, not only in the gastric mucosa but also in the lungs of infected mice. Pulmonary pTreg accumulation was observed in mice that have been infected neonatally with wildtype H. pylori but not in mice that have been infected as adults or mice infected with a VacA null mutant. Finally, we traced VacA to gastric lamina propria myeloid cells and show that it suppressed interleukin-23 (IL-23) expression by dendritic cells and induced IL-10 and TGF-β expression in macrophages. Taken together, the results are consistent with the idea that H. pylori creates a tolerogenic environment through its immunomodulator VacA, which skews T-cell responses toward Tregs, favors H. pylori persistence, and affects immunity at distant sites. IMPORTANCE Helicobacter pylori has coexisted with humans for at least 60.000 years and has evolved persistence strategies that allow it to evade host immunity and colonize its host for life. The VacA protein is expressed by all H. pylori strains and is required for high-level persistent infection in experimental mouse models. Here, we show that VacA targets myeloid cells in the gastric mucosa to create a tolerogenic environment that facilitates regulatory T-cell differentiation, while suppressing effector T-cell priming and functionality. Tregs that are induced in the periphery during H. pylori infection can be found not only in the stomach but also in the lungs of infected mice, where they are likely to affect immune responses to allergens. © 2019 Altobelli et al.","dendritic cells; host-cell interactions; immunomodulation; macrophages; mucosal infection; regulatory t cells; t cells; t-cell immunity; interleukin 10; interleukin 23; neuropilin; retinoid related orphan receptor gamma; transcription factor foxp3; transforming growth factor beta; vacuolating toxin; bacterial protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 23; transforming growth factor beta; vaca protein, helicobacter pylori; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; bacterial colonization; bone marrow cell; c57bl 6 mouse; cellular immunity; controlled study; dendritic cell; effector cell; helicobacter pylori; immune response; immunological tolerance; lamina propria; lung; lymphocyte differentiation; lymphocyte function; macrophage; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; persistent infection; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory t lymphocyte; stomach mucosa; wild type; animal; bone marrow cell; cell differentiation; disease model; drug effect; helicobacter infection; helicobacter pylori; immune evasion; immunology; metabolism; mucosa; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; regulatory t lymphocyte; animals; bacterial proteins; cell differentiation; dendritic cells; disease models, animal; gastric mucosa; helicobacter infections; helicobacter pylori; immune evasion; interleukin-10; interleukin-23; lung; macrophages; mice; mucous membrane; myeloid cells; t-lymphocytes, regulatory; transforming growth factor beta"

However, the means by which microbiota promotes intestinal IgA responses remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that the host can sense gut bacterial metabolites in addition to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and that recognition of these small molecules influences host immune response in the intestines and beyond. We reported here that microbiota metabolite short-chain fatty acid acetate promoted intestinal IgA responses, which was mediated by ""metabolite-sensing"" GPR43. GPR43 -/- mice demonstrated lower levels of intestinal IgA and IgA + gut bacteria compared with those in wild type (WT) mice. Feeding WT but not GPR43 -/- mice acetate but not butyrate promoted intestinal IgA response independent of T cells. Acetate promoted B-cell IgA class switching and IgA production in vitro in the presence of WT but not GPR43 -/- dendritic cells (DCs). Mechanistically, acetate-induced DC expression of Aldh1a2, which converts Vitamin A into its metabolite retinoic acid (RA).

"The mucin muc2 limits pathogen burdens and epithelial barrier dysfunction during salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium colitis","Zarepour M, Bhullar K, Montero M, Ma C, Huang T, Velcich A, Xia L, Vallance BA",2013,"Article","10.1128/IAI.00854-13","Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a model organism used to explore the virulence strategies underlying Salmonella pathogenesis. Although intestinal mucus is the first line of defense in the intestine, its role in protection against Salmonella is still unclear. The intestinal mucus layer is composed primarily of the Muc2 mucin, a heavily O-glycosylated glycoprotein. The core 3-derived O-glycans of Muc2 are synthesized by core 3 β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C3GnT). Mice lacking these glycans still produce Muc2 but display a thinner intestinal mucus barrier. We began our investigations by comparing Salmonella- induced colitis and mucus dynamics in Muc2-deficient (Muc2-/-) mice, C3GnT-/- mice, and wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice. Salmonella infection led to increases in luminal Muc2 secretion in WT and C3GnT-/- mice. When Muc2-/- mice were infected with Salmonella, they showed dramatic susceptibility to infection, carrying significantly higher cecal and liver pathogen burdens, and developing significantly higher barrier disruption and higher mortality rates, than WT mice. We found that the exaggerated barrier disruption in infected Muc2-/- mice was invA dependent. We also tested the susceptibility of C3GnT-/- mice and found that they carried pathogen burdens similar to those of WT mice but developed exaggerated barrier disruption. Moreover, we found that Muc2-/- mice were impaired in intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) expression and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) detoxification activity in their ceca, potentially explaining their high mortality rates during infection. Our data suggest that the intestinal mucus layer (Muc2) and core 3 O-glycosylation play critical roles in controlling Salmonella intestinal burdens and intestinal epithelial barrier function, respectively. ©2013, American Society for Microbiology.","; alkaline phosphatase; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; mucin 2; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial load; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; colitis; controlled study; cytokine production; enzyme activity; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; infection sensitivity; intestine epithelium; intestine mucosa permeability; mortality; mouse; mucus secretion; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; rna extraction; salmonella typhimurium; salmonellosis; animals; colitis; gene expression regulation; intestinal mucosa; lipopolysaccharides; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; mucin-2; polysaccharides; salmonella infections, animal; salmonella typhimurium"

"The Gut Microbial Community Structure of the North American River Otter (Lontra canadensis) in the Alberta Oil Sands Region in Canada: Relationship with Local Environmental Variables and Metal Body Burden","Guo G, Eccles KM, McMillan M, Thomas PJ, Chan HM, Poulain AJ",2020,"Article","10.1002/etc.4876","The Alberta Oil Sands Region in Canada is home to one of the largest oil bitumen deposits in the world. The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is a top predator with a small home range and is sensitive to disturbances; it has been designated as a sentinel species for the potential impacts of the natural resource exploitation on freshwater ecosystems in the Alberta Oil Sands Region. With an increasing interest in noninvasive biomarkers, recent studies suggest that gut microbiota can be used as a potential biomarker of early biological effects on aquatic wildlife. The goal of the present study was to determine the river otter gut microbial structure related to environmental variables characterizing mining activities and metal body burden. We obtained 18 trapped animals from and surrounding the surface mineable area of the Alberta Oil Sands Region. The gut microbial community structure was characterized using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses. Trace metal concentrations in the liver were measured by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. Our study revealed that the gut bacteria of river otters in the Alberta Oil Sands Region clustered in 4 groups dominated by Peptostreptococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Nostocaceae. We show that arsenic, barium, rubidium, liver-body weight ratio, and δ15N were associated with each cluster. When comparing affected versus less affected sites, we show that river otter gut bacterial community and structure are significantly related to trophic level of the river otter but not to Alberta Oil Sands Region mining activities. Our study reveals that the gut bacterial dynamics can provide insights into the diet and habitat use of river otters but that more work is needed to use it as a pollution biomarker.

"The waaL gene mutation compromised the inhabitation of Enterobacter sp. Ag1 in the mosquito gut environment","Pei D, Jiang J, Yu W, Kukutla P, Uentillie A, Xu J",2015,"Article","10.1186/s13071-015-1049-1","Background: The mosquito gut harbors a variety of bacteria that are dynamically associated with mosquitoes in various contexts. However, little is known about bacterial factors that affect bacterial inhabitation in the gut microbial community. Enterobacter sp. Ag1 is a predominant Gram negative bacterium in the mosquito midgut. Methods: In a mutant library that was generated using transposon Tn5-mediated mutagenesis, a mutant was identified, in which the gene waaL was disrupted by the Tn5 insertion. The waaL encodes O antigen ligase, which is required for the attachment of O antigen to the outer core oligosaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: The waaL- mutation caused the O antigen repeat missing in the LPS. The normal LPS structure was restored when the mutant was complemented with a plasmid containing waaL gene. The waaL- mutation did not affect bacterial proliferation in LB culture, the mutant cells grew at a rate the same as the wildtype (wt) cells. However, when waaL- strain were co-cultured with the wt strain or complemented strain, the mutant cells proliferated with a slower rate, indicating that the mutants were less competitive than wt cells in a community setting. Similarly, in a co-feeding assay, when fluorescently tagged wt strain and waaL- strain were orally co-introduced into the gut of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, the mutant cells were less prevalent in both sugar-fed and blood-fed guts. The data suggest that the mutation compromised the bacterial inhabitation in the gut community. Besides, the mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress, demonstrated by lower survival rate upon exposure to 20 mM H2O2. Conclusion: Lack of the O antigen structure in LPS of Enterobacter compromised the effective growth in co-culture and co-feeding assays. In addition, O-antigen was involved in protection against oxidative stress. The findings suggest that intact LPS is crucial for the bacteria to steadily stay in the gut microbial community. © 2015 Pei et al.","enterobacter sp. ag1; inhabitation; lipopolysaccharide; malaria mosquito; mosquito gut; o antigen ligase; oxidative stress; waal gene; bacterium lipopolysaccharide; fluorescent dye; hydrogen peroxide; o antigen; oligosaccharide; bacterial protein; hydrogen peroxide; transposon; animal cell; anopheles stephensi; antigen binding; antigen structure; article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial survival; bacterium culture; carbohydrate analysis; cell growth; cell mutant; cell proliferation; coculture; controlled study; enterobacter; gene disruption; gene mutation; genetic complementation; growth rate; intestine flora; mosquito; nonhuman; oxidative stress; plasmid; strain difference; survival rate; transposon; waal gene; wild type; animal; anopheles; drug effects; enterobacter; gastrointestinal tract; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; mutagenesis; mutation; physiology; anopheles stephensi; bacteria (microorganisms); enterobacter; enterobacter sp.; negibacteria; animals; anopheles; bacterial proteins; dna transposable elements; enterobacter; gastrointestinal tract; gene expression regulation, bacterial; hydrogen peroxide; mutagenesis; mutation; oxidative stress"
"Metagenomic sequencing for surveillance of food- and waterborne viral diseases","Nieuwenhuijse DF, Koopmans MPG",2017,"Article","10.3389/fmicb.2017.00230","A plethora of viruses can be transmitted by the food- and waterborne route. However, their recognition is challenging because of the variety of viruses, heterogeneity of symptoms, the lack of awareness of clinicians, and limited surveillance efforts. Classical food- and waterborne viral disease outbreaks are mainly caused by caliciviruses, but the source of the virus is often not known and the foodborne mode of transmission is difficult to discriminate from human-to-human transmission. Atypical food- and waterborne viral disease can be caused by viruses such as hepatitis A and hepatitis E. In addition, a source of novel emerging viruses with a potential to spread via the food- and waterborne route is the repeated interaction of humans with wildlife. Wildlife-to-human adaptation may give rise to self- limiting outbreaks in some cases, but when fully adjusted to the human host can be devastating. Metagenomic sequencing has been investigated as a promising solution for surveillance purposes as it detects all viruses in a single protocol, delivers additional genomic information for outbreak tracing, and detects novel unknown viruses. Nevertheless, several issues must be addressed to apply metagenomic sequencing in surveillance. First, sample preparation is difficult since the genomic material of viruses is generally overshadowed by host- and bacterial genomes. Second, several data analysis issues hamper the efficient, robust, and automated processing of metagenomic data. Third, interpretation of metagenomic data is hard, because of the lack of general knowledge of the virome in the food chain and the environment. Further developments in virus-specific nucleic acid extraction methods, bioinformatic data processing applications, and unifying data visualization tools are needed to gain insightful surveillance knowledge from suspect food samples. © 2017 Nieuwenhuijse and Koopmans.","foodborne; high-throughput sequencing; metagenomics; surveillance; viral pathogens; article; bacteriophage; decision making; diarrhea; disease surveillance; disease transmission; dna barcoding; food poisoning; genomic fragment; hepatitis e; high throughput sequencing; human; human parainfluenza virus 1; metagenomics; molecular genetics; nonhuman; phylogeny; quality control; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus detection; virus infection; virus transmission; vomiting; water borne disease; whole genome sequencing"
"The HOG pathway is critical for the colonization of the mouse gastrointestinal tract by Candida albicans","Prieto D, Román E, Correia I, Pla J",2014,"Article","10.1371/journal.pone.0087128","The opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans is a frequent inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract where it usually behaves as a harmless commensal. In this particular niche, it needs to adapt to the different micro environments that challenge its survival within the host. In order to determine those factors involved in gut adaptation, we have used a gastrointestinal model of colonization in mouse to trace the behaviour of fungal cells. We have developed a genetic labelling system based on the complementary spectral properties of the fluorescent proteins GFP and a new C. albicans codon-adapted RFP (dTOM2) that allow a precise quantification of the fungal population in the gut via standard in vitro cultures or flow cytometry. This methodology has allowed us to determine the role of the three MAP kinase pathways of C. albicans (mediated by the MAPK Mkc1, Cek1 or Hog1) in mouse gut colonization via competitive assays with MAPK pathway mutants and their isogenic wild type strain. This approach reveals the signalling through HOG pathway as a critical factor influencing the establishment of C. albicans in the mouse gut. Less pronounced effects for mkc1 or cek1 mutants were found, only evident after 2-3 weeks of colonization. We have also seen that hog1 mutants is defective in adhesion to the gut mucosa and sensitive to bile salts. Finally, we have developed a genetic strategy for the in vivo excision (tetracycline-dependent) of any specific gene during the course of colonization in this particular niche, allowing the analysis of its role during gut colonization. © 2014 Prieto et al.","; green fluorescent protein; triacylglycerol lipase; yellow fluorescent protein; animal experiment; animal model; article; candida albicans; cek1 gene; colony forming unit; controlled study; enzyme activity; female; fungal colonization; fungal gene; fungus identification; gastrointestinal tract; gene expression; hog1 gene; microbial adhesion; mkc1 gene; mouse; nonhuman; pathogen load; signal transduction; stomach ph; adaptation, biological; animals; candida albicans; dna primers; flow cytometry; gastrointestinal tract; green fluorescent proteins; luminescent proteins; mice; mitogen-activated protein kinases; signal transduction"
"Reactive Oxygen Species Production and Brugia pahangi Survivorship in Aedes polynesiensis with Artificial Wolbachia Infection Types","Andrews ES, Crain PR, Fu Y, Howe DK, Dobson SL",2012,"Article","10.1371/journal.ppat.1003075","Heterologous transinfection with the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia has been shown previously to induce pathogen interference phenotypes in mosquito hosts. Here we examine an artificially infected strain of Aedes polynesiensis, the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti, which is the causative agent of Lymphatic filariasis (LF) throughout much of the South Pacific. Embryonic microinjection was used to transfer the wAlbB infection from Aedes albopictus into an aposymbiotic strain of Ae. polynesiensis. The resulting strain (designated ""MTB"") experiences a stable artificial infection with high maternal inheritance. Reciprocal crosses of MTB with naturally infected wild-type Ae. polynesiensis demonstrate strong bidirectional incompatibility. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the MTB strain differ significantly relative to that of the wild-type, indicating an impaired ability to regulate oxidative stress. Following a challenge with Brugia pahangi, the number of filarial worms achieving the infective stage is significantly reduced in MTB as compared to the naturally infected and aposymbiotic strains. Survivorship of MTB differed significantly from that of the wild-type, with an interactive effect between survivorship and blood feeding. The results demonstrate a direct correlation between decreased ROS levels and decreased survival of adult female Aedes polynesiensis. The results are discussed in relation to the interaction of Wolbachia with ROS production and antioxidant expression, iron homeostasis and the insect immune system. We discuss the potential applied use of the MTB strain for impacting Ae. polynesiensis populations and strategies for reducing LF incidence in the South Pacific. © 2012 Andrews et al.","; reactive oxygen metabolite; sucrose; aedes; aedes albopictus; aedes polynesiensis; article; bacterial infection; blood; brugia pahangi; controlled study; disease predisposition; egg laying; embryo; female; lymphatic filariasis; male; microinjection; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; survival; wolbachia; aedes; animals; brugia pahangi; elephantiasis, filarial; female; oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species; wolbachia; aedes albopictus; aedes polynesiensis; bacteria (microorganisms); brugia pahangi; hexapoda; wolbachia; wuchereria bancrofti"

However, growing evidence demonstrates that KRIT1 is implicated in the modulation of major redox-sensitive signaling pathways and mechanisms involved in adaptive responses to oxidative stress and inflammation, suggesting that its loss-of-function mutations may have pathological effects not limited to CCM disease. The aim of this study was to address whether KRIT1 loss-of-function predisposes to the development of pathological conditions associated with enhanced endothelial cell susceptibility to oxidative stress and inflammation, such as arterial endothelial dysfunction (ED) and atherosclerosis. Silencing of KRIT1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) resulted in increased expression of endothelial proinflammatory adhesion molecules vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and in enhanced susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis. These effects were associated with a downregulation of Notch1 activation that could be rescued by antioxidant treatment, suggesting that they are consequent to altered intracellular redox homeostasis induced by KRIT1 loss-of-function. Furthermore, analysis of the aorta of heterozygous KRIT1+/- mice fed a high-fructose diet to induce systemic oxidative stress and inflammation demonstrated a 1.6-fold increased expression of VCAM-1 and an approximately 2-fold enhanced fat accumulation (7.5% vs 3.6%) in atherosclerosis-prone regions, including the aortic arch and aortic root, as compared to corresponding wild-type littermates. In conclusion, we found that KRIT1 deficiency promotes ED, suggesting that, besides CCM, KRIT1 may be implicated in genetic susceptibility to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. © 2019 by the authors.","atherosclerosis; cerebral cavernous malformation (ccm); endothelial dysfunction (ed); icam-1; krit1; notch signaling; notch1; oxidative stress; ros; vcam-1; apolipoprotein e; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; krev interaction trapped protein 1; low density lipoprotein; notch1 receptor; reactive oxygen metabolite; rhoa guanine nucleotide binding protein; small interfering rna; tiron; tumor necrosis factor; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; krev interaction trapped protein 1; krit1 protein, mouse; notch1 receptor; tumor necrosis factor; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; animal experiment; animal model; aortic arch; aortic atherosclerosis; aortic root; apoptosis; article; cavernous hemangioma; controlled study; down regulation; endothelial dysfunction; gene expression; gene mutation; gene silencing; genetic susceptibility; genetic transfection; high-fructose diet; human; human cell; inflammation; lipid storage; loss of function mutation; mouse; mrna expression level; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; protein expression; radioimmunoprecipitation; real time polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; western blotting; animal; aorta; atherosclerosis; c57bl mouse; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; pathology; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascular endothelium; animals; aorta; apoptosis; atherosclerosis; endothelium, vascular; human umbilical vein endothelial cells; humans; intercellular adhesion molecule-1; krit1 protein; lipid metabolism; loss of function mutation; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; oxidative stress; receptor, notch1; tumor necrosis factor-alpha; vascular cell adhesion molecule-1"

To investigate this question, we transferred caecal microbiota from either obese or lean mice to antibiotic-free, conventional wild-type mice. We found that transferring obese-mouse gut microbiota to mice on normal chow (NC) acutely reduces markers of hepatic gluconeogenesis with decreased hepatic PEPCK activity, compared to non-inoculated mice, a phenotypic trait blunted in conventional NOD2 KO mice. Furthermore, transferring of obese-mouse microbiota changes both the gut microbiota and the microbiome of recipient mice. We also found that transferring obese gut microbiota to NC-fed mice then fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) acutely impacts hepatic metabolism and prevents HFD-increased hepatic gluconeogenesis compared to non-inoculated mice. Moreover, the recipient mice exhibit reduced hepatic PEPCK and G6Pase activity, fed glycaemia and adiposity. Conversely, transfer of lean-mouse microbiota does not affect markers of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

There has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in both wild and artificially reared Bar-headed geese, even though the importance of gut microbiome in vertebrate nutrient and energy metabolism, immune homeostasis and reproduction is widely acknowledged. In this study, metagenomic methods have been used to describe the microbial community structure and composition of functional genes associated with both wild and artificially reared Bar-headed goose. Taxonomic analyses revealed that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the four most abundant phyla in the gut of Bar-headed geese. Bacteroidetes were significantly abundant in the artificially reared group compared to wild group. Through functional profiling, we found that artificially reared Bar-headed geese had higher bacterial gene content related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy metabolism and coenzyme transport, and metabolism. A comprehensive gene catalog of Bar-headed geese metagenome was built, and the metabolism of carbohydrate, amino acid, nucleotide, and energy were found to be the four most abundant categories.

"The evolutionary consequences of human–wildlife conflict in cities","Schell CJ, Stanton LA, Young JK, Angeloni LM, Lambert JE, Breck SW, Murray MH",2021,"Article","10.1111/eva.13131","Human–wildlife interactions, including human–wildlife conflict, are increasingly common as expanding urbanization worldwide creates more opportunities for people to encounter wildlife. Wildlife–vehicle collisions, zoonotic disease transmission, property damage, and physical attacks to people or their pets have negative consequences for both people and wildlife, underscoring the need for comprehensive strategies that mitigate and prevent conflict altogether. Management techniques often aim to deter, relocate, or remove individual organisms, all of which may present a significant selective force in both urban and nonurban systems. Management-induced selection may significantly affect the adaptive or nonadaptive evolutionary processes of urban populations, yet few studies explicate the links among conflict, wildlife management, and urban evolution. Moreover, the intensity of conflict management can vary considerably by taxon, public perception, policy, religious and cultural beliefs, and geographic region, which underscores the complexity of developing flexible tools to reduce conflict. Here, we present a cross-disciplinary perspective that integrates human–wildlife conflict, wildlife management, and urban evolution to address how social–ecological processes drive wildlife adaptation in cities. We emphasize that variance in implemented management actions shapes the strength and rate of phenotypic and evolutionary change. We also consider how specific management strategies either promote genetic or plastic changes, and how leveraging those biological inferences could help optimize management actions while minimizing conflict. Investigating human–wildlife conflict as an evolutionary phenomenon may provide insights into how conflict arises and how management plays a critical role in shaping urban wildlife phenotypes. © 2020 The Authors.

Quantitative RT-PCR detected in normal mouse eyes considerable levels of DAP12 and multiple DAP12-coupled receptors, in particular TREM-1, Clec5a and SIRPb1. The role of DAP12 and its receptors in experimental autoimmune diseases has been controversial. Here, we analysed the effect of DAP12 deficiency on the capacity of mice to mount immunopathogenic cellular responses to the uveitogenic ocular antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), and to develop experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Surprisingly, sequential analysis of EAU in mice deficient in DAP12 in two different animal facilities at first revealed enhanced disease as compared with wild-type mice, but when these mice were re-derived into a second, cleaner, animal facility, the response of control mice was essentially unchanged, whereas the DAP12 null mice were markedly hyporesponsive relative to controls in the new facility. Accordingly, when stimulated in vitro with IRBP, lymphocytes from the DAP12-deficient mice housed in the two facilities proliferated and produced opposite profiles of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, compared with their controls. These findings therefore demonstrate that the effects of DAP12 deficiency on development of autoimmune disease are dramatically affected by environmental factors. Published 2013.

"Milk osteopontin, a nutritional approach to prevent alcohol-induced liver injury","Ge X, Lu Y, Leung T-M, Sørensen ES, Nieto N",2013,"Article","10.1152/ajpgi.00014.2013","Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide; thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions. Key events for the onset and progression of alcoholic liver disease result in part from the gut-to-liver interaction. Osteopontin is a cytokine present at high concentration in human milk, umbilical cord, and infants' plasma with beneficial potential. We hypothesized that dietary administration of milk osteopontin could prevent alcohol-induced liver injury perhaps by maintaining gut integrity and averting hepatic inflammation and steatosis. Wild-type mice were fed either the control or the ethanol Lieber-DeCarli diets alone or in combination with milk osteopontin for 3 wk, and parameters of gut and liver damage were measured. Milk osteopontin protected the stomach and the gut by increasing gland height, crypt cell plus enterocyte proliferation, and mucin content in addition to lowering macrophages, plasmacytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the mucosa and submucosa in alcohol-fed mice. Milk osteopontin targeted the gut-liver axis, preserving the expression of tight-junction proteins in alcohol-fed mice thus maintaining intestinal integrity and permeability. There was protection from liver injury since transaminases, the activity scores, triglyceride levels, neutrophil infiltration, 3-nitrotyrosine residues, lipid peroxidation end products, translocation of gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide levels, and tumor necrosis factor-α were lower in cotreated than in ethanol-fed mice. Furthermore, milk osteopontin diminished ethanol-mediated liver injury in OPN knockout mice. Milk osteopontin could be a simple effective nutritional therapeutic strategy to prevent alcohol hepatotoxicity due, among others, to gut protective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-steatotic actions. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.","gut; inflammation; osteopontin; steatosis; alanine aminotransferase; alcohol dehydrogenase; aspartate aminotransferase; calnexin; claudin 5; cytokeratin 19; inducible nitric oxide synthase; occludin; osteopontin; protein zo1; tight junction protein; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; uvomorulin; actin filament; alcohol consumption; alcohol liver disease; animal experiment; animal model; article; bacterial growth; cell proliferation; controlled study; crypt cell; cytokine production; diet supplementation; duodenum; enzyme activity; female; gluconeogenesis; immunohistochemistry; intestine cell; lipid peroxidation; liver protection; liver toxicity; lymphocyte; macrophage; milk; mouse; neutrophil; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; nutritional assessment; plasma cell; priority journal; protein expression; scoring system; steatosis; stomach; stomach mucosa; submucosa; treatment duration; triacylglycerol blood level; gut; inflammation; osteopontin; steatosis; animals; cattle; central nervous system depressants; chromatography, ion exchange; dietary supplements; ethanol; female; gastrointestinal tract; hepatitis, alcoholic; immunohistochemistry; liver; liver function tests; liver glycogen; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; milk proteins; mucins; neutrophil infiltration; nitric oxide synthase type ii; osteopontin; stomach; tight junctions"
"Correlates of maternal glucocorticoid levels in a socially flexible rodent","Pinho GM, Ortiz-Ross X, Reese AN, Blumstein DT",2019,"Article","10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104577","While it is generally accepted that social isolation has detrimental effects on social species, little is known about the importance of social interactions in less social species–particularly for wild reproductive females. We studied socially-flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked whether features of the social environment are associated with maternal fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations. Since changes in maternal baseline glucocorticoids may have positive or negative consequences for offspring fitness, we were also interested in estimating their relationship with measures of reproductive success. We fitted generalized linear mixed effects models to a dataset including maternal FGM measurements, social network metrics, maternal/alloparental care, and pup FGM and survival. Agonistic interactions were positively associated with maternal FGM levels, while mothers that engaged in relatively more affiliative interactions had reduced FGM levels when living in environments with low predator pressure. Pups associated with mothers exhibiting high FGM levels had low annual survival rates, received less maternal/alloparental care and had higher FGM levels. Interestingly, offspring from mothers with high FGM levels were more likely to survive the summer when born in small litters. In sum, social interactions likely influence and are influenced by glucocorticoid levels of facultatively social females. Potential benefits of social bonds may be context-specific, and agonistic interactions may be tightly correlated with fitness. Female marmots exhibiting high FGM levels had overall low reproductive success, which is predicted by the cort-fitness hypothesis. However, under adverse conditions, offspring summer survival can be maximized if pups are born in small litters. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","cort-fitness hypothesis; glucocorticoid hormones; marmot; network metrics; reproductive success; social behavior; social stress; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid; animal experiment; article; correlation analysis; feces level; female; litter size; marmota; marmota flaviventer; maternal care; mother; nonhuman; parental behavior; predator stress; priority journal; reproductive success; rodent; social behavior; social bonding; social environment; social interaction; social network; summer; survival rate; aggression; animal; chemistry; feces; male; maternal behavior; metabolism; mother; newborn; physiology; reproduction; rodent; aggression; animals; animals, newborn; feces; female; glucocorticoids; litter size; male; marmota; maternal behavior; mothers; reproduction; rodentia; social behavior"
"Food supplementation affects gut microbiota and immunological resistance to parasites in a wild bird species","Knutie SA",2020,"Article","10.1111/1365-2664.13567","Supplemental feeding can increase the overall health of animals but also can have varying consequences for animals dealing with parasites. Furthermore, the mechanism mediating the effect of food supplementation on host–parasite interactions remains poorly understood. The goal of the study was to determine the effect of food supplementation on host defences against parasitic nest flies and whether host gut microbiota, which can affect immunity, potentially mediates these relationships. In a fully crossed design, I experimentally manipulated the abundance of parasitic nest flies Protocalliphora sialia and food availability then characterized the gut microbiota, immune responses and nest parasite abundance of nestling eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis. Food supplemented birds had 75% fewer parasites than unsupplemented birds. Parasite abundance decreased throughout the breeding season for unsupplemented birds, but abundance did not change throughout the season for supplemented birds. Food supplementation increased overall fledging success. Parasitism had a sublethal effect on blood loss, but food supplementation mitigated these effects by increasing parasite resistance via the nestling IgY antibody response. Food supplementation increased the gut bacterial diversity in nestlings, which was negatively related to parasite abundance. Food supplementation also increased the relative abundance of Clostridium spp. in nestlings, which was positively related to their antibody response and negatively related to parasite abundance.

Overall, the results of this study suggest that food supplementation, especially early in the breeding season, increases resistance to parasitism during the early life stage of the host, which might be mediated by the gut microbiota. Wildlife food supplementation is a common pastime for humans worldwide and therefore it is important to understand the consequences of this activity on animal health. Furthermore, supplemental feeding could induce resistance to detrimental parasites (e.g. invasive parasites) in hosts when management of the parasite is not immediately possible. © 2020 British Ecological Society","bird feeding; blowfly; diet; food supplementation; host defences; microbiome; resistance; tolerance; bird; breeding season; defense mechanism; digestive system; feeding behavior; fly; food availability; food supplementation; microorganism; parasite resistance; relative abundance; sublethal effect; wild population; animalia; aves; bacteria (microorganisms); clostridium; protocalliphora sialia; sialia sialis"
"High-throughput screening of mouse gene knockouts identifies established and novel high body fat phenotypes","Powell DR, Revelli J-P, Doree DD, Dacosta CM, Desai U, Shadoan MK, Rodriguez L, Mullens M, Yang QM, Ding Z-M, Kirkpatrick LL, Vogel P, Zambrowicz B, Sands AT, Platt KA, Hansen GM, Brommage R",2021,"Article","10.2147/DMSO.S322083","Purpose: Obesity is a major public health problem. Understanding which genes contribute to obesity may better predict individual risk and allow development of new therapies. Because obesity of a mouse gene knockout (KO) line predicts an association of the orthologous human gene with obesity, we reviewed data from the Lexicon Genome5000™ high throughput phenotypic screen (HTS) of mouse gene KOs to identify KO lines with high body fat. Materials and Methods: KO lines were generated using homologous recombination or gene trapping technologies. HTS body composition analyses were performed on adult wild-type and homozygous KO littermate mice from 3758 druggable mouse genes having a human ortholog. Body composition was measured by either DXA or QMR on chow-fed cohorts from all 3758 KO lines and was measured by QMR on independent high fat diet-fed cohorts from 2488 of these KO lines. Where possible, comparisons were made to HTS data from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Results: Body fat data are presented for 75 KO lines. Of 46 KO lines where independent external published and/or IMPC KO lines are reported as obese, 43 had increased body fat. For the remaining 29 novel high body fat KO lines, Ksr2 and G2e3 are supported by data from additional independent KO cohorts, 6 (Asnsd1, Srpk2, Dpp8, Cxxc4, Tenm3 and Kiss1) are supported by data from additional internal cohorts, and the remaining 21 including Tle4, Ak5, Ntm, Tusc3, Ankk1, Mfap3l, Prok2 and Prokr2 were studied with HTS cohorts only. Conclusion: These data support the finding of high body fat in 43 independent external published and/or IMPC KO lines. A novel obese phenotype was identified in 29 additional KO lines, with 27 still lacking the external confirmation now provided for Ksr2 and G2e3 KO mice. Undoubtedly, many mammalian obesity genes remain to be identified and characterized. © 2021 Powell et al.","druggable; gene trapping; homologous recombination; obesity; ak5 gene; animal tissue; ankk1 gene; article; asnsd1 gene; body composition; body fat; controlled study; cxxc4 gene; dpp8 gene; dual energy x ray absorptiometry; g2e3 gene; gene; gene knockout; genetic analysis; high throughput screening; homologous recombination; kiss1 gene; ksr2 gene; mfap3l gene; mouse; nonhuman; ntm gene; obesity; phenotype; prok2 gene; prokr2 gene; srpk2 gene; tenm3 gene; tle4 gene; tusc3 gene"
"Marked Seasonal Variation in Structure and Function of Gut Microbiota in Forest and Alpine Musk Deer","Jiang F, Gao H, Qin W, Song P, Wang H, Zhang J, Liu D, Wang D, Zhang T",2021,"Article","10.3389/fmicb.2021.699797","Musk deer (Moschus spp.) is a globally endangered species due to excessive hunting and habitat fragmentation. Captive breeding of musk deer can efficiently relieve the hunting pressure and contribute to the conservation of the wild population and musk supply. However, its effect on the gut microbiota of musk deer is unclear. Recent studies have indicated that gut microbiota is associated with host health and its environmental adaption, influenced by many factors. Herein, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used based on 262 fecal samples from forest musk deer (M. berezovskii) (FMD) and 90 samples from alpine musk deer (M. chrysogaster) (AMD). We sought to determine whether seasonal variation can affect the structure and function of gut microbiota in musk deer. The results demonstrated that FMD and AMD had higher α-diversity of gut microbiota in the cold season than in the warm season, suggesting that season change can affect gut microbiota diversity in musk deer. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) also revealed significant seasonal differences in the structure and function of gut microbiota in AMD and FMD. Particularly, phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes significantly dominated the 352 fecal samples from captive FMD and AMD. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes were significantly decreased in summer than in spring and substantially increased in winter than in summer. In contrast, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes showed opposite results. Furthermore, dominant bacterial genera and main metabolic functions of gut microbiota in musk deer showed significant seasonal differences. Overall, the abundance of main gut microbiota metabolic functions in FMD was significantly higher in the cold season. WGCNA analysis indicated that OTU6606, OTU5027, OTU7522, and OTU3787 were at the core of the network and significantly related with the seasonal variation. These results indicated that the structure and function in the gut microbiota of captive musk deer vary with seasons, which is beneficial to the environmental adaptation and the digestion and metabolism of food. This study provides valuable insights into the healthy captive breeding of musk deer and future reintroduction programs to recover wild populations. © Copyright © 2021 Jiang, Gao, Qin, Song, Wang, Zhang, Liu, Wang and Zhang.","16s rrna gene sequencing; core microbiome; metabolic functions; musk deer; seasonal variation; "

"Toll-like receptors 2 and 7 mediate coagulation activation and coagulopathy in murine sepsis","Williams B, Neder J, Cui P, Suen A, Tanaka K, Zou L, Chao W",2019,"Article","10.1111/jth.14543","Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition often manifested as marked inflammation and severe coagulopathy. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in inflammation, organ dysfunction and mortality in animal sepsis. Objectives: To investigate the role of TLR signaling in mediating sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) in a mouse model. Methods: Polymicrobial sepsis was created by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or fecal slurry peritoneal injection. To quantify global clotting function, two viscoelastic assays were performed with rotational thromboelastometry, and the results were presented as maximum clot firmness (MCF): (a) EXTEM to test tissue factor (TF)-initiated clot formation; and (b) FIBTEM to test EXTEM in the presence of a platelet inhibitor, cytochalasin D. Plasma coagulation factors were quantified with ELISA. TF gene expression and protein expression were determined with real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Between 4 and 24 hours after CLP surgery, wild-type mice showed significant MCF reduction in both EXTEM and FIBTEM tests. This was accompanied by marked thrombocytopenia and a significant increase in the levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plasma TF, and D-dimer. In comparison, TLR2−/− and TLR7−/− CLP mice showed preserved MCF and platelet counts, and near-normal plasma TF levels. Bone marrow–derived macrophages treated with a TLR2 agonist Pam3cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam3cys) or a TLR7 agonist (R837) showed marked increases in TF gene expression and protein expression. MicroRNA-146a, a newly identified proinflammatory mediator that is upregulated during sepsis, induced TF production via a TLR7-dependent mechanism. Conclusions: Murine sepsis leads to an increased procoagulant response, thrombocytopenia, and global coagulopathy. TLR2 and TLR7 play an important role in procoagulant production and in SIC. © 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","coagulopathy; microrna; rotem; sepsis; toll-like receptor; d dimer; fibrinogen; interleukin 6; microrna 146a; myeloid differentiation factor 88; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; thromboplastin; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor adaptor molecule 1; cytokine; myd88 protein, mouse; myeloid differentiation factor 88; ticam-1 protein, mouse; tlr2 protein, mouse; tlr3 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 3; vesicular transport adaptor protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; blood clotting disorder; bone marrow derived macrophage; cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis; controlled study; gene expression; mouse; nonhuman; peritonitis; platelet count; priority journal; protein expression; sepsis; thrombocytopenia; thromboelastography; tlr signaling; animal; blood; blood clotting; blood clotting disorder; c57bl mouse; cell culture; complication; disease model; genetics; knockout mouse; macrophage; male; metabolism; sepsis; signal transduction; thrombocytopenia; adaptor proteins, vesicular transport; animals; blood coagulation; blood coagulation disorders; cells, cultured; cytokines; disease models, animal; macrophages; male; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; myeloid differentiation factor 88; sepsis; signal transduction; thrombocytopenia; toll-like receptor 2; toll-like receptor 3"

The mucosal defenses against infection are not completely understood. We have used the streptomycin mouse model for Salmonella Typhimurium diarrhea to analyze the role of interferon gamma receptor (IFN-γR)-signaling in mucosal defense. IFN-γ is known to contribute to acute S. Typhimurium diarrhea. We have compared the acute mucosal inflammation in IFN-γR -/- mice and wild type animals. IFN-γR -/- mice harbored increased pathogen loads in the mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria. Surprisingly, the epithelium of the IFN-γR -/- mice did not show the dramatic ""loss"" of mucus-filled goblet cell vacuoles, a hallmark of the wild type mucosal infection. Using bone marrow chimeric mice we established that IFN-γR-signaling in stromal cells (e.g. goblet cells, enterocytes) controlled mucus excretion/vacuole loss by goblet cells. In contrast, IFN-γR-signaling in bone marrow-derived cells (e.g. macrophages, DCs, PMNs) was required for restricting pathogen growth in the gut tissue. Thus IFN-γR-signaling influences different mucosal responses to infection, including not only pathogen restriction in the lamina propria, but, as shown here, also goblet cell function. © 2011 Songhet et al.","; gamma interferon receptor; streptomycin; gamma interferon; gamma interferon receptor; interferon receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bone marrow cell; cell function; cell loss; cell vacuole; controlled study; dendritic cell; diarrhea; goblet cell; inflammation; intestine cell; lamina propia; macrophage; mouse; mucosa; nonhuman; polymorphonuclear cell; salmonella typhimurium; salmonella typhimurium infection; salmonellosis; signal transduction; stroma cell; animal; bone marrow; c57bl mouse; cell culture; fluorescent antibody technique; genetics; immunology; intestine mucosa; metabolism; microbiology; mouse mutant; physiology; stroma cell; animalia; mus; salmonella typhimurium; animals; bone marrow; cells, cultured; fluorescent antibody technique; goblet cells; interferon-gamma; intestinal mucosa; macrophages; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; receptors, interferon; salmonella infections; salmonella typhimurium; signal transduction; stromal cells"

Germ-free (GF) mice genetically susceptible to IBD can address this question. Smad3-/- mice with defective transforming growth factor ß signaling are a model of IBD and colon cancer. They develop IBD upon colonization with Helicobacter under specific pathogen-free conditions, suggesting a role of the microbiome in IBD in this model. Thus, we rederived Smad3-/- mice GF to determine the potential of using these mice for testing the causative role of microbiomes in IBD. We found that fecal microbiomes from mice with IBD cause more severe gut inflammation in GF Smad3-/- and wild type mice compared to microbiomes from healthy mice and that Helicobacter induces gut inflammation within the context of other microbiomes but not by itself. Unexpectedly, GF Smad3+/+ and Smad3+/- mice given IBD microbiomes develop IBD despite their lack of disease in SPF conditions upon Helicobacter infection. This was not unique to the background strain of our Smad3 model (129); both wild type C57BL/6 and 129 strains developed IBD upon fecal transfer. However, wild type Swiss Webster stock was not susceptible, indicating that the genetic background of recipient mice influences the severity of IBD following fecal transfer. Our data suggest that the microbiome is an independent risk factor contributing to IBD development, and careful characterization of new GF models is needed to understand potential sources of confounding factors influencing microbiome studies in these mice. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","fecal transfer; germ-free; inflammatory bowel disease; microbiome; mouse model; smad3; dextran sulfate; rna 16s; smad protein; smad3 protein; smad3 protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial colonization; bacterium culture; bioassay; blood sampling; controlled study; disease course; disease severity; feces analysis; feces microflora; female; gene transfer; genetic background; genetic susceptibility; helicobacter infection; histology; histopathology; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; male; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; validation study; animal; bioassay; c57bl mouse; disease model; fecal microbiota transplantation; genetics; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; microbiology; transgenic mouse; animals; biological assay; disease models, animal; fecal microbiota transplantation; female; gastrointestinal microbiome; inflammatory bowel diseases; male; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, transgenic; smad3 protein"
"Outdoor immunology: Methodological considerations for ecologists","Boughton RK, Joop G, Armitage SAO",2011,"Article","10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01817.x","1.Immune defence is an incredibly complicated system, but to understand how it functions in an ecological context is challenging. Our focus is to outline the diversity of ways to measure immune function for ecologists, and to provide some details on the limitations in interpretation of results. 2.There are two broad questions that ecological immunologists have to deal with. The first is what assays are appropriate for the research question of interest? Some researchers assume the biological relevance of an immune assay without investigation or a complete understanding of the immune response. Therefore, the second question is, what parasite challenge does one choose, and does a measurement of immune function reflect the response of the host towards that parasite? There are many assumptions, caveats, and pitfalls facing ecological immunologists, and investigating the relationships between immune assays and whole organismal defence will help us to understand variations in immune responses. 3.We provide an extensive listing of immune function measures, presenting examples from both the vertebrate and invertebrate literature, and wherever possible from non-model organisms. We also outline how these responses are part of an integrated immune defence and encourage thinking about immune function as a hierarchical defence model. We describe how immune responses interact with one another, identify concerns regarding when to measure an immune response, and describe general problems faced when trying to collect a measure of immune function in wild organisms. 4.Extrinsic factors influence immune measurements and the importance of parasites is often overlooked. We give several examples of how parasites interact with organism's immune systems, suggest greater inclusion of parasites into ecological immunology experiments, describe how micro-organisms may interact symbiotically with their host's immune system, and advocate the inclusion of tolerance and resistance in ecological immunological thinking. © 2011 The Authors.

"Diet and phylogeny shape the gut microbiota of Antarctic seals: A comparison of wild and captive animals","Nelson TM, Rogers TL, Carlini AR, Brown MV",2013,"Article","10.1111/1462-2920.12022","The gut microbiota of mammals underpins the metabolic capacity and health of the host. Our understanding of what influences the composition of this community has been limited primarily to evidence from captive and terrestrial mammals. Therefore, the gut microbiota of southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, and leopard seals, Hydrurga leptonyx, inhabiting Antarctica were compared with captive leopard seals. Each seal exhibited a gut microbiota dominated by four phyla: Firmicutes (41.5±4.0%), Fusobacteria (25.6±3.9%), Proteobacteria (17.0±3.2%) and Bacteroidetes (14.1±1.7%). Species, age, sex and captivity were strong drivers of the composition of the gut microbiota, which can be attributed to differences in diet, gut length and physiology and social interactions. Differences in particular prey items consumed by seal species could contribute to the observed differences in the gut microbiota. The longer gut of the southern elephant seal provides a habitat reduced in available oxygen and more suitable to members of the phyla Bacteroidetes compared with other hosts. Among wild seals, 16 'core' bacterial community members were present in the gut of at least 50% of individuals. As identified between southern elephant seal mother-pup pairs, 'core' members are passed on via vertical transmission from a young age and persist through to adulthood. Our study suggests that these hosts have co-evolved with their gut microbiota and core members may provide some benefit to the host, such as developing the immune system. Further evidence of their strong evolutionary history is provided with the presence of 18 shared 'core' members in the gut microbiota of related seals living in the Arctic. The influence of diet and other factors, particularly in captivity, influences the composition of the community considerably. This study suggests that the gut microbiota has co-evolved with wild mammals as is evident in the shared presence of 'core' members. © 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","; ribosome rna; animal; antarctica; article; bacterium; classification; comparative study; diet; domestic animal; ecosystem; environment; female; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; human; isolation and purification; male; metagenome; microbiology; phoca; phylogeny; physiology; species difference; animals; animals, domestic; antarctic regions; bacteria; diet; ecosystem; environment; female; gastrointestinal tract; humans; male; metagenome; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal; seals, earless; species specificity; animalia; bacteria (microorganisms); bacteroidetes; felidae; firmicutes; fusobacteria; hydrurga leptonyx; mammalia; mirounga leonina; proteobacteria"

As a result, the microbiota of the solitary bee nests may be highly dependent on introduced materials. In order to investigate how the collected pollen is associated with the nest microbiota, we used metabarcoding of the ITS2 rDNA and the 16S rDNA to simultaneously characterize the pollen composition and the bacterial communities of 100 solitary bee nest chambers belonging to seven megachilid species. We found a weak correlation between bacterial and pollen alpha diversity and significant associations between the composition of pollen and that of the nest microbiota, contributing to the understanding of the link between foraging and bacteria acquisition for solitary bees. Since solitary bees cannot establish bacterial transmission routes through eusociality, this link could be essential for obtaining bacterial symbionts for this group of valuable pollinators.

"ST2/MyD88 deficiency protects mice against acute graft-versus-host disease and spares regulatory T cells","Griesenauer B, Jiang H, Yang J, Zhang J, Ramadan AM, Egbosiuba J, Campa K, Paczesny S",2019,"Article","10.4049/jimmunol.1800447","Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) hinders the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Plasma levels of soluble membrane-bound ST2 (ST2) are elevated in human and murine aGVHD and correlated to type 1 T cells response. ST2 signals through the adapter protein MyD88. The role of MyD88 in T cells during aGVHD has yet to be elucidated. We found that knocking out MyD88 in the donor T cells protected against aGVHD independent of IL-1R and TLR4 signaling in two murine HCT models. This protection was entirely driven by MyD882/2 CD4 T cells. Transplanting donor MyD882/2 conventional T cells (Tcons) with wild-type (WT) or MyD882/2 regulatory T cells (Tregs) lowered aGVHD severity and mortality. Transcriptome analysis of sorted MyD882/2 CD4 T cells from the intestine 10 d post-HCT showed lower levels of Il1rl1 (gene of ST2), Ifng, Csf2, Stat5, Batf, and Jak2. Transplanting donor ST22/2 Tcons with WT or ST22/2 Tregs showed a similar phenotype with what we observed when using donor MyD882/2 Tcons. Decreased ST2 was confirmed at the protein level with less secretion of soluble ST2 and more expression of ST2 compared with WT T cells. Our data suggest that Treg suppression from lack of MyD88 signaling in donor Tcons during alloreactivity uses the ST2 but not the IL-1R or TLR4 pathways, and ST2 represents a potential aGVHD therapeutic target sparing Tregs.

"Precise and rapid validation of candidate gene by allele specific knockout with CRISPR/Cas9 in wild mice","Chao T, Liu Z, Zhang Y, Zhang L, Huang R, He L, Gu Y, Chen Z, Zheng Q, Shi L, Zheng W, Qi X, Kong E, Zhang Z, Lawrence T, Liang Y, Lu L",2019,"Article","10.3389/fgene.2019.00124","It is a tempting goal to identify causative genes underlying phenotypic differences among inbred strains of mice, which is a huge reservoir of genetic resources to understand mammalian pathophysiology. In particular, the wild-derived mouse strains harbor enormous genetic variations that have been acquired during evolutionary divergence over 100s of 1000s of years. However, validating the genetic variation in non-classical strains was extremely difficult, until the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools. In this study, we first describe a T cell phenotype in both wild-derived PWD/PhJ parental mice and F1 hybrids, from a cross to C57BL/6 (B6) mice, and we isolate a genetic locus on Chr2, using linkage mapping and chromosome substitution mice. Importantly, we validate the identification of the functional gene controlling this T cell phenotype, Cd44, by allele specific knockout of the PWD copy, leaving the B6 copy completely intact. Our experiments using F1 mice with a dominant phenotype, allowed rapid validation of candidate genes by designing sgRNA PAM sequences that only target the DNA of the PWD genome. We obtained 10 animals derived from B6 eggs fertilized with PWD sperm cells which were subjected to microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting machinery. In the newborns of F1 hybrids, 80% (n = 10) had allele specific knockout of the candidate gene Cd44 of PWD origin, and no mice showed mistargeting of the B6 copy. In the resultant allele-specific knockout F1 mice, we observe full recovery of T cell phenotype. Therefore, our study provided a precise and rapid approach to functionally validate genes that could facilitate gene discovery in classic mouse genetics. More importantly, as we succeeded in genetic manipulation of mice, allele specific knockout could provide the possibility to inactivate disease alleles while keeping the normal allele of the gene intact in human cells.

"Mutated CEACAMs Disrupt Transforming Growth Factor Beta Signaling and Alter the Intestinal Microbiome to Promote Colorectal Carcinogenesis","Gu S, Zaidi S, Hassan MI, Mohammad T, Malta TM, Noushmehr H, Nguyen B, Crandall KA, Srivastav J, Obias V, Lin P, Nguyen B-N, Yao M, Yao R, King CH, Mazumder R, Mishra B, Rao S, Mishra L",2020,"Article","10.1053/j.gastro.2019.09.023","Background &amp; Aims: We studied interactions among proteins of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family, which interact with microbes, and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) signaling pathway, which is often altered in colorectal cancer cells. We investigated mechanisms by which CEACAM proteins inhibit TGFB signaling and alter the intestinal microbiome to promote colorectal carcinogenesis. Methods: We collected data on DNA sequences, messenger RNA expression levels, and patient survival times from 456 colorectal adenocarcinoma cases, and a separate set of 594 samples of colorectal adenocarcinomas, in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of feces from wild-type mice and mice with defects in TGFB signaling (Sptbn1+/– and Smad4+/–/Sptbn1+/–) to identify changes in microbiota composition before development of colon tumors. CEACAM protein and its mutants were overexpressed in SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines, which were analyzed by immunoblotting and proliferation and colony formation assays. Results: In colorectal adenocarcinomas, high expression levels of genes encoding CEACAM proteins, especially CEACAM5, were associated with reduced survival times of patients. There was an inverse correlation between expression of CEACAM genes and expression of TGFB pathway genes (TGFBR1, TGFBR2, and SMAD3). In colorectal adenocarcinomas, we also found an inverse correlation between expression of genes in the TGFB signaling pathway and genes that regulate stem cell features of cells. We found mutations encoding L640I and A643T in the B3 domain of human CEACAM5 in colorectal adenocarcinomas; structural studies indicated that these mutations would alter the interaction between CEACAM5 and TGFBR1. Overexpression of these mutants in SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines increased their anchorage-independent growth and inhibited TGFB signaling to a greater extent than overexpression of wild-type CEACAM5, indicating that they are gain-of-function mutations. Compared with feces from wild-type mice, feces from mice with defects in TGFB signaling had increased abundance of bacterial species that have been associated with the development of colon tumors, including Clostridium septicum, and decreased amounts of beneficial bacteria, such as Bacteroides vulgatus and Parabacteroides distasonis. Conclusion: We found expression of CEACAMs and genes that regulate stem cell features of cells to be increased in colorectal adenocarcinomas and inversely correlated with expression of TGFB pathway genes. We found colorectal adenocarcinomas to express mutant forms of CEACAM5 that inhibit TGFB signaling and increase proliferation and colony formation.

In the aquaculture industry, feed acidifiers have been used to increase the growth of aquatic animals. However, there is limited study on the effects of acidic condition on the virulence and survival of pathogens in aquaculture. In this study, we investigated the survival ability of Vibrio parahaemolyticus at lethal acidic pH (4.0) after adapted the bacteria to sub-lethal acidic pH (5.5) for 1 hr. Our results indicated that the adapted strain increased the survival ability at lethal acidic pH invoked by an inorganic (HCl) or organic (citric) acid. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) results revealed that 321 genes were differentially expressed at the sub-lethal acidic pH including cadC, cadBA and groES/groEL relating to acid tolerance response (ATR), as well as genes relating to outer membrane, heat-shock proteins, phosphotransferase system and flagella system. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed that cadC and cadBA were upregulated under sub-lethal acidic conditions. The CadC protein could directly regulate the expression of cadBA to modulate the ATR in V. parahaemolyticus. RNA-seq data also indicated that 113 genes in the CadC-dependent way and 208 genes in the CadC-independent way were differentially expressed, which were related to the regulation of ATR. Finally, the motility and cytotoxicity of the sub-lethal acidic adapted wild type (WT) were significantly increased compared with the unadapted strain. Our results demonstrated that the dietary acidifiers may increase the virulence and survival of V. parahaemolyticus in aquaculture. © 2021 The Authors.

Turquoise killifish display differences in lifespan among wild populations, representing an ideal natural experiment in evolution and diversification of life history. By combining genome sequencing and population genetics, we investigate the evolutionary forces shaping lifespan among wild turquoise killifish populations. We generate an improved reference genome assembly and identify genes under positive and purifying selection, as well as those evolving neutrally. Short-lived populations from the outer margin of the species range have small population size and accumulate deleterious mutations in genes significantly enriched in the WNT signaling pathway, neurodegeneration, cancer and the mTOR pathway.

Whether the associated mucosal inflammation is important or redundant for effective induction of immunity is, however, still unclear. Here we use a model of auxotrophic Salmonella infection in germ-free mice to show that live bacterial virulence factor-driven immunogenicity can be uncoupled from inflammatory pathogenicity. Although live auxotrophic Salmonella no longer causes inflammation, its mucosal virulence factors remain the main drivers of protective mucosal immunity; virulence factor-deficient, like killed, bacteria show reduced efficacy. Assessing the involvement of innate pathogen sensing mechanisms, we show MYD88/TRIF, Caspase-1/Caspase-11 inflammasome, and NOD1/NOD2 nodosome signaling to be individually redundant. In colonized animals we show that microbiota metabolite cross-feeding may recover intestinal luminal colonization but not pathogenicity.

"Gut microbiome composition of wild western lowland gorillas is associated with individual age and sex factors","Pafčo B, Sharma AK, Petrželková KJ, Vlčková K, Todd A, Yeoman CJ, Wilson BA, Stumpf R, White BA, Nelson KE, Leigh S, Gomez A",2019,"Article","10.1002/ajpa.23842","Objectives: Environmental and ecological factors, such as geographic range, anthropogenic pressure, group identity, and feeding behavior are known to influence the gastrointestinal microbiomes of great apes. However, the influence of individual host traits such as age and sex, given specific dietary and social constraints, has been less studied. The objective of this investigation was to determine the associations between an individual's age and sex on the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome in wild western lowland gorillas. Materials and Methods: Publicly available 16S rRNA data generated from fecal samples of different groups of Gorilla gorilla gorilla in the Central African Republic were downloaded and bioinformatically processed. The groups analyzed included habituated, partially habituated and unhabituated gorillas, sampled during low fruit (dry, n = 28) and high fruit (wet, n = 82) seasons. Microbial community analyses (alpha and beta diversity and analyses of discriminant taxa), in tandem with network-wide approaches, were used to (a) mine for specific age and sex based differences in gut bacterial community composition and to (b) asses for gut community modularity and bacterial taxa with potential functional roles, in the context of seasonal food variation, and social group affiliation. Results: Both age and sex significantly influenced gut microbiome diversity and composition in wild western lowland gorillas. However, the largest differences were observed between infants and adults in habituated groups and between adults and immature gorillas within all groups, and across dry and wet seasons. Specifically, although adults always showed greater bacterial richness than infants and immature gorillas, network-wide analyses showed higher microbial community complexity and modularity in the infant gorilla gut. Sex-based microbiome differences were not evident among adults, being only detected among immature gorillas. Conclusions: The results presented point to a dynamic gut microbiome in Gorilla spp., associated with ontogeny and individual development. Of note, the gut microbiomes of breastfeeding infants seemed to reflect early exposure to complex, herbaceous vegetation. Whether increased compositional complexity of the infant gorilla gut microbiome is an adaptive response to an energy-limited diet and an underdeveloped gut needs to be further tested. Overall, age and sex based gut microbiome differences, as shown here, maybe mainly attributed to access to specific feeding sources, and social interactions between individuals within groups. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","age; gorilla; microbiome; sex; rna 16s; bacterial dna; rna 16s; adaptation; adult; article; bioinformatics; food intake; gorilla gorilla; groups by age; habituation; immaturity; infant; intestine flora; microbial community; nonhuman; seasonal variation; sex; species composition; theory; aging; animal; feces; female; genetics; intestine flora; male; microbiology; physical anthropology; physiology; sex factor; aging; animals; anthropology, physical; dna, bacterial; feces; female; gastrointestinal microbiome; gorilla gorilla; male; rna, ribosomal, 16s; sex factors"

A highfat diet (HFD), a risk factor for obesity, has also been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A proinflammatory state characterized by systemic and local increases in cytokine and chemokine levels are noted in both obesity and IBD, but it is unclear whether obesity is a risk factor for IBD. To examine any association between obesity and IBD, we chose FVB.129P2- Abcb1atm1BorN7 (Mdr1a-/-)mice, because this strain develops IBD spontaneously with age without a chemical or bacterial ''trigger.'' In addition, its background strain, FVB, has been used for diet-induced obesity studies. Mdr1a-/- mice and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a HFD (~60%calories from fat) or a low-fat diet (LFD~11%calories from fat) for 12 wk. Obesity phenotypes examined included body weight measurements, glucose metabolism changes, and adiposity at termination of the study. IBD was determined by clinical signs, necropsy, and histopathology. We found that compared with those fed the LFD, both the Mdr1a-/- and WT mice fed the HFD had greater weight gains and elevated plasma leptin concentrations (P &lt; 0.0001).When all mice were analyzed,weight gainwas also associatedwith inflammation in mesenteric fat (R2 = 0.5; P &lt; 0.0001) and mesenteric lymph nodes (R2 = 0.4; P &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, the HFD was not associated with IBD inWT mice, whereas it exacerbated spontaneous IBD in Mdr1a-/- mice (P=0.012;Fisher's exact test).

However, it remains unclear how development of another regulatory T cell subset, Tr1 cells, is regulated in the intestine. Here, we analyzed the role of two probiotic strains of intestinal bacteria, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve in T cell development in the intestine. B. breve, but not L. casei, induced development of IL-10-producing Tr1 cells that express cMaf, IL-21, and Ahr in the large intestine. Intestinal CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) mediated B. breve-induced development of IL-10-producing T cells. CD103+ DCs from Il10-/-, Tlr2-/-, and Myd88-/- mice showed defective B. breve-induced Tr1 cell development. B. breve-treated CD103+ DCs failed to induce IL-10 production from co-cultured Il27ra-/- T cells. B. breve treatment of Tlr2-/- mice did not increase IL-10-producing T cells in the colonic lamina propria. Thus, B. breve activates intestinal CD103+ DCs to produce IL-10 and IL-27 via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway thereby inducing IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in the large intestine. Oral B. breve administration ameliorated colitis in immunocompromised mice given naïve CD4+ T cells from wild-type mice, but not Il10-/- mice.

Given the rise of metabolic disorders including obesity, a detailed understanding of this regulatory network is in urgent need. Yet, our level of understanding is far from completeness and complicated by the discovery of additional layers in metabolic regulation, such as the impact of the microbial community present in the gut on the hosts' energy storage levels. Here, we investigate the interplay between genome variation, diet and the gut microbiome in the shaping of a metabolic phenotype. For this purpose, we reared a set of fully sequenced wild type Drosophila melanogaster flies under basal and nutritionally challenged conditions and performed metabolic and microbiome profiling experiments. Our results introduce the fly as a model system to investigate the impact of genome variation on the metabolic response to diet alterations and reveal candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with different metabolic traits, as well as metabolite-metabolite and metabolite-microbe correlations. Intriguingly, the dietary changes affected the microbiome composition less than anticipated.

Most research to date has focused on interactions between the host with its gut microbiota; however, there remain considerable gaps in knowledge regarding microbial consortia in other organs, including interspecific divergence, temporal stability, variation drivers, and their effects on the host. To fill these gaps, we examined oral and vaginal microbiota composition in four free-living mouse species of the genus Apodemus, each varying in the degree of female promiscuity. To assess temporal stability and microbiota resistance to environmental change, we exposed one of the species, Apodemus uralensis, to standardized captive conditions and analyzed longitudinal changes in its microbiota structure. Our results revealed the existence of a “core” oral microbiota that was not only shared among all four species but also persisted almost unchanged in captivity. On the other hand, vaginal microbiota appears to be more plastic in captive conditions and less species-specific in comparison with oral microbiota. This study is amongst the first to describe oral microbiota dynamics. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota results are especially surprising in light of the well-known role of stable vaginal microbiota as a defense against pathogens. The results indicate the existence of diverse mechanisms that shape each microbiota. On the other hand, our data provides somewhat ambiguous support for the systematic effect of phylogeny and social system on both oral and vaginal microbiota structures. © 2020, The Author(s).","; adult; animal experiment; apodemus uralensis; article; controlled study; environmental change; female; infectious agent; mouse; mouth flora; nonhuman; phylogeny; population research; vagina flora; animal; antibody specificity; bacterium; classification; dna sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; mouth; procedures; vagina; animals; bacteria; female; high-throughput nucleotide sequencing; mice; microbiota; mouth; organ specificity; phylogeny; sequence analysis, dna; vagina"

In Manduca sexta, E. faecalis is an infrequent member of the commensal gut community, but its translocation to the hemocoel results in a commensal-to-pathogen switch. To investigate E. faecalis factors required for commensalism, we identified E. faecalis genes that are upregulated in the gut of M. sexta using recombinase-based in vivo expression technology (RIVET). The RIVET screen produced 113 clones, from which we identified 50 genes that are more highly expressed in the insect gut than in culture. The most frequently recovered gene was locus OG1RF_11582, which encodes a 6-phosphogluconolactonase that we designated pglA. A pglA deletion mutant was impaired in both pathogenesis and gut persistence in M. sexta and produced enhanced biofilms compared with the wild type in an in vitro polystyrene plate assay. Mutation of four other genes identified by RIVET did not affect persistence in caterpillar guts but led to impaired pathogenesis. This is the first identification of genetic determinants for E. faecalis commensal and pathogenic interactions with M. sexta.

While several microbes in rice planthoppers have been broadly characterized, the abundance and diversity of bacteria and fungi in field planthoppers are largely unknown. This study investigated the bacterial and fungal community compositions of Chinese wild rice planthoppers Laodelphax striatellus and Sogatella furcifera using parallel 16S rRNA gene amplicon and internal transcribed space region sequencing. The bacteria varied significantly between the species and were partitioned significantly by sex, tissues and host environments in each species. The majority of bacteria were affiliated with the genera Wolbachia, Cardinium, Rickettsia and Pantoea. The abundance of Wolbachia was negatively correlated with that of Cardinium in both planthopper species. Compared with bacteria, the abundance and diversity of fungi did not differ between sexes but both were enriched in the gut. The bacterial community as a whole showed no significant correlation with the fungal community. The majority of fungi were related to Sarocladium, Alternaria, Malassezia, Aspergillus and Curvularia.

SDP supplementation reduces acute mucosal inflammation, as well as chronic inflammation associated with aging. The aim of this study was to analyze if SDP supplementation could ameliorate colitis in a genetic mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Wild-type mice and Mdr1a knockout (KO) mice were administered a control diet or an SDP-supplemented diet from day 21 (weaning) until day 56. The histopathological index, epithelial barrier, and intestinal immune system were analyzed in the colonic mucosa. KO mice had higher epithelial permeability, increased Muc1 and Muc4 expression, and lower abundance of E-cadherin and Muc2 (all p < 0.001). SDP prevented these effects (all p < 0.05) and decreased the colonic inflammation observed in KO mice, reducing neutrophil and monocyte infiltration and activation and the percentage of activated T helper lymphocytes in the colonic mucosa (all p < 0.05). SDP also diminished proinflammatory cytokine expression and increased the anti-inflammatory IL-10 concentration in the colonic mucosa (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with SDP enhances colon barrier function and reduces mucosal inflammation in a mouse model of IBD. © 2020 by the authors.

"Host MyD88 signaling protects against acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation","Xing S, Zhang X, Liu JH, Huang X, Zhou P",2019,"Article","10.1111/cei.13215","Recent experimental strategies to reduce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have focused largely on modifying innate immunity. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-driven myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent signalling pathways that initiate adaptive immune function are also critical for the pathogenesis of GVHD. This study aimed to delineate the role of host MyD88 in the development of acute GVHD following fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). When myeloablated BALB/c MyD88 knock-out recipients were transplanted with C57BL/6 (B6) donor cells, they developed significantly more severe GVHD than wild-type (WT) BALB/c hosts. The increased morbidity and mortality in MyD88–/– mice correlated with increased serum levels of lipopolysaccharide and elevated inflammatory cytokines in GVHD target organs. Additionally, MyD88 deficiency in BMT recipients led to increased donor T cell expansion and more donor CD11c+ cell intestinal infiltration with apoptotic cells but reduced proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells compared with that in WT BMT recipients. Decreased expression of tight junction mRNA in epithelial cells of MyD88–/– mice suggested that MyD88 contributes to intestinal integrity.

"Inclusion of Lactobacillus salivarius strain revealed a positive effect on improving growth performance, fecal microbiota and immunological responses in chicken","Sureshkumar S, Lee HC, Jung SK, Kim D, Oh KB, Yang H, Jo YJ, Lee HS, Lee S, Byun SJ",2021,"Article","10.1007/s00203-020-02088-3","Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that when administered in an appropriate amount, provide health benefits to the host. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius) on growth performance, immunological responses, fecal microbial flora and intestinal mucosal morphology in chickens. Chickens were fed with 109 colony-forming units (CFUs) of wild-type (WT) L. salivarius or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 weeks. Chickens body weight was significantly increased by administration of L. salivarius groups compared than control group. The microbial taxonomy in the small intestine and cecum was identified via the chicken feces sample. A total of 286,331 bacterial species were obtained from the chicken fecal samples in overall experimental group. From these, 145,012 bacterial species were obtained from oral administration of L. salivarius treatment group, while 141,319 bacterial species were obtained from control group. Almost 98% of all 16S rRNA sequences from the chicken fecal sample of the two groups were classified into known phyla. Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were highly abundant in both groups. Compared with the control birds, the chickens orally administered L. salivarius showed no significant differences in villus length and crypt length. Serum concentrations of the cytokines IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-4 were markedly reduced in the L. salivarius group. In summary, our findings reveal that L. salivarius can act as a potential probiotic to improve performance and overall gut health in of chickens. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","chicken; lactobacillus salivarius; oral administration; gamma interferon; interleukin 4; interleukin 8; phosphate buffered saline; probiotic agent; rna 16s; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; probiotic agent; rna 16s; actinobacteria; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bacterial strain; bacteroidetes; body weight; cecum; chicken; colony forming unit; controlled study; cyanobacterium; feces microflora; gastrointestinal tract; immune response; lactobacillus; lactobacillus salivarius; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; proteobacteria; small intestine; wild type; animal; bacterium; biodiversity; blood; cytology; feces; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; intestine mucosa; lactobacillus salivarius; microbiology; microflora; animals; bacteria; biodiversity; chickens; cytokines; feces; intestinal mucosa; lactobacillus salivarius; microbiota; probiotics; rna, ribosomal, 16s"
"Multilevel social structure and diet shape the gut microbiota of the gelada monkey, the only grazing primate","Trosvik P, de Muinck EJ, Rueness EK, Fashing PJ, Beierschmitt EC, Callingham KR, Kraus JB, Trew TH, Moges A, Mekonnen A, Venkataraman VV, Nguyen N",2018,"Article","10.1186/s40168-018-0468-6","BACKGROUND: The gelada monkey (Theropithecus gelada), endemic to the Ethiopian highlands, is the only graminivorous primate, i.e., it feeds mainly on grasses and sedges. In spite of known dental, manual, and locomotor adaptations, the intestinal anatomy of geladas is similar to that of other primates. We currently lack a clear understanding of the adaptations in digestive physiology necessary for this species to subsist on a graminoid-based diet, but digestion in other graminivores, such as ruminants, relies heavily on the microbial community residing in the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Furthermore, geladas form complex, multilevel societies, making them a suitable system for investigating links between sociality and the GI microbiota. RESULTS: Here, we explore the gastrointestinal microbiota of gelada monkeys inhabiting an intact ecosystem and document how factors like multilevel social structure and seasonal changes in diet shape the GI microbiota. We compare the gelada GI microbiota to those of other primate species, reporting a gradient from geladas to herbivorous specialist monkeys to dietary generalist monkeys and lastly humans, the ultimate ecological generalists. We also compare the microbiotas of the gelada GI tract and the sheep rumen, finding that geladas are highly enriched for cellulolytic bacteria associated with ruminant digestion, relative to other primates. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first analysis of the gelada GI microbiota, providing insights into the adaptations underlying graminivory in a primate. Our results also highlight the role of social organization in structuring the GI microbiota within a society of wild animals.","cellulolytic bacteria; ecological specialist; ethiopian highlands; gi microbiota; graminivory; multilevel society; primates; rumen; anatomy and histology; animal; bacterium; classification; diet; digestion; dna sequence; ethiopia; gastrointestinal tract; intestine flora; isolation and purification; microbiology; nucleotide sequence; physiology; rumen; sheep; theropithecus; animals; bacteria; base sequence; diet; digestion; ethiopia; gastrointestinal microbiome; gastrointestinal tract; rumen; sequence analysis, dna; sheep; theropithecus"
"Adapting functional genomic tools to metagenomic analyses: Investigating the role of gut bacteria in relation to obesity","Liu Y, Zhang C, Zhao L, Nardini C",2010,"Article","10.1093/bfgp/elq011","With the expanding availability of sequencing technologies, research previously centered on the human genome can now afford to include the study of humans' internal ecosystem (human microbiome). Given the scale of the data involved in this metagenomic research (two orders of magnitude larger than the human genome) and their importance in relation to human health, it is crucial to guarantee (along with the appropriate data collection and taxonomy) proper tools for data analysis. We propose to adapt the approaches defined for the analysis of gene-expressionmicroarray in order to infer information inmetagenomics. In particular, we applied SAM, a broadly used tool for the identification of differentially expressed genes among different samples classes, to a reported dataset on a research model with mice of two genotypes (a high density lipoprotein knockout mouse and its wild-type counterpart). The data contain two different diets (high-fat or normal-chow) to ensure the onset of obesity, prodrome of metabolic syndromes (MS). By using 16S rRNA gene as a genomic diversity marker, we illustrate how this approach can identify bacterial populations differentially enriched among different genetic and dietary conditions of the host. This approach faithfully reproduces highly-relevant results fromphylogenetic and standard statistical analyses, used to explain the role of the gut microbiome in relation to obesity. This represents a promising proof-of-principle for using functional genomic approaches in the fast growing area of metagenomics, and warrants the availability of a large body of thoroughly tested and theoretically soundmethodologies to this exciting new field. © The Author 2010.

Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency- associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Siganus fuscescens is one of the most important consumers of macroalgae and an excellent natural marine source of nutritional lipids for humans, and widely distributes in shallow coastal areas. Here we systematically studied the microbial communities of 108 wild S. fuscescens in four body habitats (i.e., skin, gill, stomach, and hindgut) and surrounding water. We found that the β-diversity but not α-diversity of fish-associated microbial communities from each habitat significantly (p < 0.05) increased as body weight increased. Also, opportunistic pathogens and probiotics (e.g., Pseudomongs, Methylobacterium) appeared to be widely distributed in different body habitats, and many digestive bacteria (e.g., Clostridium) in the hindgut; the abundances of some core OTUs associated with digestive bacteria, “Anaerovorax” (OTU_6 and OTU_46724) and “Holdemania” (OTU_33295) in the hindgut increased as body weight increased. Additionally, the quantification of ecological processes indicated that heterogeneous selection was the major process (46–70%) governing the community assembly of fish microbiomes, whereas the undominated process (64%) was found to be more important for the water microbiome. The diversity pattern showed that β-diversity (75%) of the metacommunity overweight the α-diversity (25%), confirming that the niche separation of microbial communities in different habitats and host selection were important to shape the fish-associated microbial community structure. This study enhances our mechanistic understanding of fish-associated microbial communities in different habitats, and has important implications for analyzing host-associated metacommunities. © Copyright © 2020 Wu, Xiao, Wang, Shu, Zheng, Xu, Yu, Zhang, Luo, Yang, He and Yan.","body habitats; body weight; fish-associated microbial community; metacommunity; siganus fuscescens; rna 16s; actinobacteria; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bioinformatics; body weight; community structure; controlled study; cyanobacterium; dna extraction; dna sequence; evolutionary adaptation; gene sequence; habitat; high throughput sequencing; macroalga; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; principal component analysis; proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; synechococcus; taxonomy"

Host responses to interventions that change their microbiota are largely uncharacterized. We applied a consortium of four natural antifungal bacteria to the skin of endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs, Rana sierrae, before experimental exposure to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The probiotic microbes did not persist, nor did they protect hosts, and skin peptide sampling indicated immune modulation. We characterized a novel skin defense peptide brevinin-1Ma (FLPILAGLAANLVPKLICSITKKC) that was downregulated by the probiotic treatment. Brevinin-1Ma was tested against a range of amphibian skin cultures and found to inhibit growth of fungal pathogens Bd and B. salamandrivorans, but enhanced the growth of probiotic bacteria including Janthinobacterium lividum, Chryseobacterium ureilyticum, Serratia grimesii, and Pseudomonas sp. While commonly thought of as antimicrobial peptides, here brevinin-1Ma showed promicrobial function, facilitating microbial growth. Thus, skin exposure to probiotic bacterial cultures induced a shift in skin defense peptide profiles that appeared to act as an immune response functioning to regulate the microbiome.

However, precisely how T cells regulate intestine immunity remains to be fully understood. In this study, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2) is required for the CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammation in the intestine. Using a T cell transfer colitis model, we found that MAP3K2-deficient naïve CD4 T cells had a dramatically reduced ability to induce colitis compared to wild type T cells. In addition, significantly fewer IFN-γ- but more IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells in the intestines of mice receiving MAP3K2-deficient T cells than in those from mice receiving wild type T cells was observed. Interestingly, under well-defined in vitro differentiation conditions, MAP3K2-deficient naïve T cells were not impaired in their ability to differentiate into Th1, Th17 and Treg. Furthermore, the MAP3K2-regulated colitis severity was mediated by Th1 but not Th17 cells in the intestine. At the molecular level, we showed that MAP3K2-mediated Th1 cell differentiation in the intestine was regulated by IL-18 and required specific JNK activation. Together, our study reveals a novel regulatory role of MAP3K2 in intestinal T cell immunity via the IL-18-MAP3K2-JNK axis and may provide a novel target for intervention in T cell-mediated colitis. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","colitis; il-18; map3k2; t cell immunity; th1; "
"Epithelial TLR4 Signaling Activates DUOX2 to Induce Microbiota-Driven Tumorigenesis","Burgueño JF, Fritsch J, González EE, Landau KS, Santander AM, Fernández I, Hazime H, Davies JM, Santaolalla R, Phillips MC, Diaz S, Dheer R, Brito N, Pignac-Kobinger J, Fernández E, Conner GE, Abreu MT",2021,"Article","10.1053/j.gastro.2020.10.031","Background &amp; Aims: Chronic colonic inflammation leads to dysplasia and cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We have described the critical role of innate immune signaling via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the pathogenesis of dysplasia and cancer. In the current study, we interrogate the intersection of TLR4 signaling, epithelial redox activity, and the microbiota in colitis-associated neoplasia. Methods: Inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer data sets were analyzed for expression of TLR4, dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1). Epithelial production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was analyzed in murine colonic epithelial cells and colonoid cultures. Colorectal cancer models were carried out in villin-TLR4 mice, carrying a constitutively active form of TLR4, their littermates, and villin-TLR4 mice backcrossed to DUOXA-knockout mice. The role of the TLR4-shaped microbiota in tumor development was tested in wild-type germ-free mice. Results: Activation of epithelial TLR4 was associated with up-regulation of DUOX2 and NOX1 in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. DUOX2 was exquisitely dependent on TLR4 signaling and mediated the production of epithelial H2O2. Epithelial H2O2 was significantly increased in villin-TLR4 mice; TLR4-dependent tumorigenesis required the presence of DUOX2 and a microbiota. Mucosa-associated microbiota transferred from villin-TLR4 mice to wild-type germ-free mice caused increased H2O2 production and tumorigenesis. Conclusions: Increased TLR4 signaling in colitis drives expression of DUOX2 and epithelial production of H2O2. The local milieu imprints the mucosal microbiota and imbues it with pathogenic properties demonstrated by enhanced epithelial reactive oxygen species and increased development of colitis-associated tumors. The inter-relationship between epithelial reactive oxygen species and tumor-promoting microbiota requires a 2-pronged strategy to reduce the risk of dysplasia in colitis patients. © 2021 The Authors","colitis-associated cancer; microbiome; nadph oxidases; ulcerative colitis; cyba protein; dual oxidase; dual oxidase 2; duoxa2 protein; gamma interferon; hydrogen peroxide; inducible nitric oxide synthase; noxa1 protein; noxo1 protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1; rna 16s; toll like receptor 4; unclassified drug; azoxymethane; dextran sulfate; dual oxidase; duox2 protein, mouse; duoxa2 protein, mouse; membrane protein; nox1 protein, human; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1; tlr4 protein, human; tlr4 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 4; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; carcinogenesis; colon epithelium; colon tissue; colonoid; colorectal cancer; controlled study; gene expression; in situ hybridization; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammatory bowel disease; microbiome; microflora; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; rna sequencing; signal transduction; upregulation; animal; carcinogenesis; colon; complication; disease model; drug effect; genetics; germfree animal; human; immunology; information processing; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; ulcerative colitis; animals; azoxymethane; carcinogenesis; colitis, ulcerative; colitis-associated neoplasms; colon; datasets as topic; dextran sulfate; disease models, animal; dual oxidases; gastrointestinal microbiome; germ-free life; humans; hydrogen peroxide; intestinal mucosa; membrane proteins; mice; mice, knockout; nadph oxidase 1; toll-like receptor 4"
"Gut microbes limit growth in house sparrow nestlings (Passer domesticus) but not through limitations in digestive capacity","Kohl KD, Brun A, Bordenstein SR, Caviedes-Vidal E, Karasov WH",2018,"Article","10.1111/1749-4877.12289","Recent research often lauds the services and beneficial effects of host-associated microbes on animals. However, hosting these microbes may come at a cost. For example, germ-free and antibiotic-treated birds generally grow faster than their conventional counterparts. In the wild, juvenile body size is correlated with survival, so hosting a microbiota may incur a fitness cost. Avian altricial nestlings represent an interesting study system in which to investigate these interactions, given that they exhibit the fastest growth rates among vertebrates, and growth is limited by their digestive capacity. We investigated whether reduction and restructuring of the microbiota by antibiotic treatment would: (i) increase growth and food conversion efficiency in nestling house sparrows (Passer domesticus); (ii) alter aspects of gut anatomy or function (particularly activities of digestive carbohydrases and their regulation in response to dietary change); and (iii) whether there were correlations between relative abundances of microbial taxa, digestive function and nestling growth. Antibiotic treatment significantly increased growth and food conversion efficiency in nestlings. Antibiotics did not alter aspects of gut anatomy that we considered but depressed intestinal maltase activity. There were no significant correlations between abundances of microbial taxa and aspects of host physiology. Overall, we conclude that microbial-induced growth limitation in developing birds is not driven by interactions with digestive capacity. Rather, decreased energetic and material costs of immune function or beneficial effects from microbes enriched under antibiotic treatment may underlie these effects. Understanding the costs and tradeoffs of hosting gut microbial communities represents an avenue of future research. © 2017 The Authors.

"Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome","Chassaing B, Koren O, Goodrich JK, Poole AC, Srinivasan S, Ley RE, Gewirtz AT",2015,"Article","10.1038/nature14232","The intestinal tract is inhabited by a large and diverse community of microbes collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. While the gut microbiota provides important benefits to its host, especially in metabolism and immune development, disturbance of the microbiota-host relationship is associated with numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and the group of obesity-associated diseases collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome. A primary means by which the intestine is protected from its microbiota is via multi-layered mucus structures that cover the intestinal surface, thereby allowing the vast majority of gut bacteria to be kept at a safe distance from epithelial cells that line the intestine. Thus, agents that disrupt mucus-bacterial interactions might have the potential to promote diseases associated with gut inflammation. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that emulsifiers, detergent-like molecules that are a ubiquitous component of processed foods and that can increase bacterial translocation across epithelia in vitro, might be promoting the increase in inflammatory bowel disease observed since the mid-twentieth century. Here we report that, in mice, relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder. Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was associated with microbiota encroachment, altered species composition and increased pro-inflammatory potential. Use of germ-free mice and faecal transplants indicated that such changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome. These results support the emerging concept that perturbed host-microbiota interactions resulting in low-grade inflammation can promote adiposity and its associated metabolic effects. Moreover, they suggest that the broad use of emulsifying agents might be contributing to an increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","; carboxymethylcellulose; polysorbate 80; carboxymethylcellulose; emulsifying agent; polysorbate; bacterium; cellulose; digestive system disorder; feces; immune system; metabolism; microbiology; mucus; obesity; rodent; translocation; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial translocation; cell membrane permeability; colitis; confocal microscopy; controlled study; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; human; human tissue; intestine flora; limit of quantitation; male; metabolic syndrome x; microbial diversity; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; species composition; adverse effects; animal; chemically induced; colitis; diet; drug effects; feces; gastrointestinal tract; germfree animal; inflammation; intestine mucosa; metabolic syndrome x; microbiology; microflora; obesity; pathology; bacteria (microorganisms); mus; adiposity; animals; carboxymethylcellulose sodium; colitis; diet; emulsifying agents; feces; female; gastrointestinal tract; germ-free life; inflammation; intestinal mucosa; male; metabolic syndrome x; mice; microbiota; obesity; polysorbates"
"Mechanisms governing avian phylosymbiosis: Genetic dissimilarity based on neutral and MHC regions exhibits little relationship with gut microbiome distributions of Galapagos mockingbirds","Fleischer R, Risely A, Hoeck PEA, Keller LF, Sommer S",2020,"Article","10.1002/ece3.6934","The gut microbiome of animals, which serves important functions but can also contain potential pathogens, is to varying degrees under host genetic control. This can generate signals of phylosymbiosis, whereby gut microbiome composition matches host phylogenetic structure. However, the genetic mechanisms that generate phylosymbiosis and the scale at which they act remain unclear. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are that phylosymbiosis is driven by immunogenetic regions such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) controlling microbial composition, or by spatial structuring of neutral host genetic diversity via founder effects, genetic drift, or isolation by distance. Alternatively, associations between microbes and host phylogeny may be generated by their spatial autocorrelation across landscapes, rather than the direct effects of host genetics. In this study, we collected MHC, microsatellite, and gut microbiome data from separate individuals belonging to the Galapagos mockingbird species complex, which consists of four allopatrically distributed species. We applied multiple regression with distance matrices and Bayesian inference to test for correlations between average genetic and microbiome similarity across nine islands for which all three levels of data were available. Clustering of individuals by species was strongest when measured with microsatellite markers and weakest for gut microbiome distributions, with intermediate clustering of MHC allele frequencies. We found that while correlations between island-averaged gut microbiome composition and both microsatellite and MHC dissimilarity existed across species, these relationships were greatly weakened when accounting for geographic distance. Overall, our study finds little support for large-scale control of gut microbiome composition by neutral or adaptive genetic regions across closely related bird phylogenies, although this does not preclude the possibility that host genetics shapes gut microbiome at the individual level.","biogeography; host&#8211; microbe interactions; major histocompatibility complex; microsatellites; mimus sp; wildlife genetics; package"

The transcriptome of the body wall of wild and farmed I. badionotus has now been studied for the first time by an RNA-Seq approach. The functional profile of wild I. badionotus was comparable with data in the literature for other regularly captured species. In contrast, the metabolism of first generation farmed I. badionotus was impaired. This had multiple possible causes including a sub-optimal growth environment and impaired nutrient utilization. Several key metabolic pathways that are important in effective handling and accretion of nutrients and energy, or clearance of harmful cellular metabolites, were disrupted or dysregulated. For instance, collagen mRNAs were greatly reduced and deposition of collagen proteins impaired. Wild I. badionotus is, therefore, a suitable alternative to other widely used species but, at present, the potential of farmed I. badionotus is unclear.

We examined the reduction in oxalate excretion in a rat model following oral administration of fecal microbes from a mammalian herbivore adapted to a high oxalate diet or to fecal transplants consisting of two different formulations of mixed oxalatedegrading isolates. While all transplants elicited a significant reduction in oxalate excretion initially, the greatest effect was seen with fecal microbial transplants, which persisted even in the absence of dietary oxalate. The reduction in oxalate excretion in animals given fecal transplants corresponded with the establishment of diverse bacteria, including known oxalate-degrading bacteria and a cohesive network of bacteria centered on oxalate-degrading specialists from the Oxalobacteraceae family. Results suggested that the administration of a complete community of bacteria facilitates a cohesive balance in terms of microbial interactions. Our work offers important insights into the development of targeted bacteriotherapies intended to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in patients at risk for recurrent calcium oxalate stones as well as bacteriotherapies targeting other toxins for elimination. IMPORTANCE Oxalate is a central component in 80% of kidney stones. While mammals do not possess the enzymes to degrade oxalate, many gastrointestinal bacteria are efficient oxalate degraders. We examined the role of cohesive microbial networks for oxalate metabolism, using Sprague-Dawley rats as a model host. While the transplantation of oxalate-degrading bacteria alone to the Sprague-Dawley hosts did increase oxalate metabolism, fecal transplants from a wild mammalian herbivore, Neotoma albigula, had a significantly greater effect. Furthermore, the boost for oxalate metabolism persisted only in animals that received fecal transplants. Animals receiving fecal transplants had a more diverse and cohesive network of bacteria associated with the Oxalobacteraceae, a family known to consist of specialist oxalate-degrading bacteria, than did animals that received oxalate-degrading bacteria alone. Our results indicate that fecal transplants are more effective at transferring specific functions than are microbial specialists alone, which has broad implications for the development of bacteriotherapies. © 2017 Miller et al.","fecal transplant; gut microbiota; oxalate; probiotics; woodrat; "
"β2GPI exerts an anti-obesity effect in female mice by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting lipolysis","Dong S, Qi M, Wang Y, Chen L, Weaver JC, Krilis SA, Giannakopoulos B",2017,"Article","10.18632/oncotarget.21536","In humans, males compared to females have increased visceral adipose tissue which contributes to their increased risk of early death. Mice display analogous sexual diamorphism whereby females are protected from weight gain when fed a high fat diet compared to males. A role has recently been reported for β2-glycoprotein I, an abundant plasma protein, in healthy leanness in humans. In this study we investigated the role of β2-glycoprotein I in fat metabolism in male and female mice fed a normal chow or high fat diet. We have made a number of novel insights into factors contributing to sexual diamorphism in obesity. Female wild type mice are protected from obesity when fed a high fat diet due to down regulation of lipogenesis in the visceral adipose tissues. This down regulation is due to β2-glycoprotein I as female mice deficient in this protein have increased levels of lipogenesis enzymes in their visceral adipose tissues with an accompanying increase in weight compared to female wild type controls. Understanding female specific regulators of obesity may lead to sex specific anti-obesity therapies to address this major health problem. © Dong et al.","apolipoprotein h; lipogenesis; obesity; sexual dimorphism; β2-glycoprotein i; beta2 glycoprotein 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; controlled study; down regulation; female; intraperitoneal fat; lipid diet; lipogenesis; lipolysis; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; protein function; sex difference"
"Changes in digestive traits and body nutritional composition accommodate a trophic niche shift in Trinidadian guppies","Sullam KE, Dalton CM, Russell JA, Kilham SS, El-Sabaawi R, German DP, Flecker AS",2015,"Article","10.1007/s00442-014-3158-5","A trophic niche shift can occur as an adaptive response to environmental change such as altered resource quality, abundance or composition. Alterations in digestive traits such as gut morphology and physiology may enable these niche shifts and affect the persistence of populations and species. Relatively few studies, however, have assessed how niche shifts influence suites of digestive traits through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary mechanisms, and how these trait changes can subsequently alter the nutrition, fitness and life history of organisms. We investigated how population divergence and plasticity alter the gut physiology of wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), assessing whether variation in digestive traits correspond with enhanced nutrient assimilation under a pronounced dietary shift. We examined gut enzyme activity, and gut size and mass of wild guppies from both high-predation (HP) and low-predation (LP) habitats when reared in the laboratory and fed on high- or low-quality diets designed to reflect their dietary differences previously found in nature. After 10 weeks on the experimental diets, HP guppies maintained shorter and lighter guts than LP guppies on either diet. Guppies also differed in their digestive enzymatic profiles, more often reflecting nutrient balancing so that increased enzyme expression tended to correspond with more deficient nutrients in the diet. LP guppies had increased somatic phosphorus at the end of the experiment, possibly related to the higher alkaline phosphatase activity in their guts. Our results suggest that differences in gut physiology exist among populations of Trinidadian guppies that may reflect local adaptation to their disparate environments. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","digestive enzymes; gut morphology; local adaptation; nutrient balancing; poecilia; stoichiometry; alkaline phosphatase; adaptation; anatomy and histology; animal; animal food; body composition; diet; digestion; ecosystem; enzymology; evolution; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; metabolism; nutritional status; phenotype; physiology; poecilia; predation; trinidad and tobago; adaptation, physiological; alkaline phosphatase; animal nutritional physiological phenomena; animals; biological evolution; body composition; diet; digestion; ecosystem; gastrointestinal tract; nutritional status; phenotype; poecilia; predatory behavior; trinidad and tobago"
"Gut microbiome is affected by inter-sexual and inter-seasonal variation in diet for thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia)","Góngora E, Elliott KH, Whyte L",2021,"Article","10.1038/s41598-020-80557-x","The role of the gut microbiome is increasingly being recognized by health scientists and veterinarians, yet its role in wild animals remains understudied. Variations in the gut microbiome could be the result of differential diets among individuals, such as variation between sexes, across seasons, or across reproductive stages. We evaluated the hypothesis that diet alters the avian gut microbiome using stable isotope analysis (SIA) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We present the first description of the thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) fecal microbiome. The murre microbiome was dominated by bacteria from the genus Catellicoccus, ubiquitous in the guts of many seabirds. Microbiome variation was explained by murre diet in terms of proportion of littoral carbon, trophic position, and sulfur isotopes, especially for the classes Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Clostridia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. We also observed differences in the abundance of bacterial genera such as Catellicoccus and Cetobacterium between sexes and reproductive stages. These results are in accordance with behavioural observations of changes in diet between sexes and across the reproductive season. We concluded that the observed variation in the gut microbiome may be caused by individual prey specialization and may also be reinforced by sexual and reproductive stage differences in diet. © 2021, The Author(s).","; rna 16s; animal; bacterium; charadriiformes; climate; diet; environmental monitoring; feces; genetics; intestine flora; microbiology; physiology; procedures; reproduction; season; animals; bacteria; charadriiformes; climate; diet; environmental monitoring; feces; gastrointestinal microbiome; reproduction; rna, ribosomal, 16s; seasons"

Consequently, small mammals require considerable energy to maintain a high mass-specific metabolic rate (MSMR) and sustain target body temperature. In association with gut microbiota, mammalian hosts acquire absorbable molecules and fulfill their metabolic requirements. Our objective was to characterize gut microbes in wild mammals and relate those findings to host body-size scaling. Two large (Petaurista philippensis grandis and P. alborufus lena), one medium (Trogopterus xanthipes) and one small (Pteromys volans orii) species of flying squirrels (FS) were studied. Using 16S rRNA genes, 1,104 OTUs were detected from four FS, with 1.99% of OTUs shared among all FS. Although all FS gut microbiota were dominated by Firmicutes, they were constituted by different bacterial families. Moreover, Bacteroidetes accounted for up to 19% of gut microbiota in small FS, but was absent in large FS. Finally, based on metagenome predictions, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism genes were enriched in small body-size FS. In conclusion, gut microbiota compositions and predictive metabolic functions were characteristic of body-size in FS, consistent with their adaptations to folivorous dietary niches. © 2020, The Author(s).","; rna 16s; animal; bacteroidetes; body size; diet; feces; firmicutes; genetic variation; genetics; intestine flora; metabolism; metagenome; microbiology; phylogeny; sciuridae; animals; bacteroidetes; body size; diet; feces; firmicutes; gastrointestinal microbiome; genetic variation; metagenome; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal, 16s; sciuridae"
"Killing with kindness: Does widespread generalised provisioning of wildlife help or hinder biodiversity conservation efforts?","Shutt JD, Lees AC",2021,"Short Survey","10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109295","Provisioning of wildlife with food, water and breeding sites is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon. While some provisioning is targeted at single species of conservation concern, generalised provisioning is more common and can exceed the local availability of natural resources for recipient taxa. Generalised provisioning is enthusiastically promoted by many conservation organisations as a means to foster connection with nature and help wildlife. However, such a vast input of additional resources into the environment must have diverse, ecosystem-wide consequences. Direct effects upon recipient taxa have garnered most research interest, and are generally positive in leading to increased survival, productivity and hence population growth. However, we argue that the wider implications for the recipients' non-provisioned competitors, prey and predators are underappreciated and have the potential to generate pervasive negative impacts for biodiversity. The impact of provisioning has also hitherto been considered predominantly in urban contexts, overlooking the movements of wildlife to and from provisioning sources and the widespread nature of both human settlements and provisioning, underappreciating the potential scale of impact. Using a case study of UK garden bird food and nestbox provisioning, we hypothesise how well-intentioned provisioning could be contributing to widespread ecological community change and homogenisation. This may consequently help drive declines in species of conservation concern by asymmetrically benefitting common and adaptable species, leaving their competitors exposed to enhanced direct competition, hyperpredation, mesopredator release and heightened disease transmission risks. We recommend further research into these ecosystem cascades and a more cautious, evidence-based approach to the encouragement of provisioning wildlife. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","biotic homogenisation; bird feeding; competition; human-wildlife interaction; hyperpredation; supplementary resources; biodiversity; disease transmission; ecosystem function; human settlement; nest box; numerical model; risk assessment; survival; wildlife management"

We examine these changes in Philornis downsi (Muscidae), an invasive parasitic fly of land birds in the Galapagos Islands. Using a 16S rDNA profiling approach we studied the microbiome of larvae and adults of wild and laboratory-reared populations. These populations diverged in their microbiomes, significantly more so in larval than in adult flies. In field-collected second-instar larvae, Klebsiella (70.3%) was the most abundant taxon, while in the laboratory Ignatzschineria and Providencia made up 89.2% of the community. In adults, Gilliamella and Dysgonomonas were key members of the core microbiome of field-derived females and males but had no or very low representation in the laboratory. Adult flies harbour sex-specific microbial consortia in their gut, as male core microbiomes were significantly dominated by Klebsiella. Thus, P. downsi microbiomes are dynamic and shift correspondingly with life cycle and diet. Sex-specific foraging behaviour of adult flies and nest conditions, which are absent in the laboratory, may contribute to shaping distinct larval, and adult male and female microbiomes.

Ginseng has been reported to aid in body weight management, however, its mechanism of action is not yet clear. In this study, we focused on the potential modulating effect of ginseng on gut microbiota, aiming to identify specific strains and their metabolites, especially long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), which mediate the anti-obesity effects of ginseng. Design Db/db mice were gavaged with ginseng extract (GE) and the effects of GE on gut microbiota were evaluated using 16S rDNA-based high throughput sequencing. To confirm the candidate fatty acids, untargeted metabolomics analyses of the serum and medium samples were performed. Results We demonstrated that GE can induce Enterococcus faecalis, which can produce an unsaturated LCFA, myristoleic acid (MA). Our results indicate that E. faecalis and its metabolite MA can reduce adiposity by brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and beige fat formation. In addition, the gene of E. faecalis encoding Acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) exhibited the biosynthetic potential to synthesise MA, as knockdown (KD) of the ACOT gene by CRISPR-dCas9 significantly reduced MA production. Furthermore, exogenous treatment with KD E. faecalis could not reproduce the beneficial effects of wild type E. faecalis, which work by augmenting the circulating MA levels. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the gut microbiota-LCFA-BAT axis plays an important role in host metabolism, which may provide a strategic advantage for the next generation of anti-obesity drug development. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

"Composition of intestinal microbiota in immune- Deficient mice kept in three different housing conditions","Thoene-Reineke C, Fischer A, Friese C, Briesemeister D, Göbel UB, Kammertoens T, Bereswill S, Heimesaat MM",2014,"Article","10.1371/journal.pone.0113406","Background: Abundance of commensals constituting the intestinal microbiota (IM) affects the immune system and predisposes to a variety of diseases, including intestinal infections, cancer, inflammatory and metabolic disorders. Housing conditions determine the IM and can hence influence the immune system. We analyzed how both variables affect the IM of four immune-compromized mouse lines kept under different housing conditions.Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the IM composition in mice by quantitative 16S rRNA RT-PCR analysis of the main fecal bacterial groups (Enterobacteriaceae , enterococci, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides/Prevotella (BP) spp., Clostridium leptum and coccoides groups). Mice were homozygous (HO) or heterozygous (HE) for a targeted inactivating mutation of either the IFN- c Receptor (R), IFN-c, Rag1 or IL-4 genes. Overall, differences in IM composition were subtle. However, in the SPF-barrier, total eubacterial loads were higher in Rag1 HE versus Rag1 HO mice as well as in IFN-cR HE versus IFN-cR HO and WT animals. Although absent in WT mice, bifidobacterial loads were higher in HO and HE IFN-c and Rag1 as well as IL-4 HO mice. Furthermore, BP was slightly lower in HO and HE IFN-cR and IFN-c mice as well as in IL-4 HO mice as compared to WT controls. Interestingly, IM compositions were comparable in WT mice when kept in individual ventilated cages (IVC) or open cages (OC). IFN-c HO and HE mice, however, had higher enterobacteria and BP loads, but lacked bifidobacteria when kept in OC versus IVC, as was the case in HO and HE Rag1 mice. In addition, Rag1 HO mice harbored higher clostridial loads when housed in OC as compared to IVC. Unexpectedly, lactobacilli levels were higher in IFN-cR mice when kept in OC versus IVC.Conclusion/Significance: Housing-dependent and immune-deficiency mediated changes in intestinal microbiota composition were rather subtle but may nevertheless impact immunopathology in experimental models. ©2014 Thoene-Reineke et al.","; gamma interferon; gamma interferon receptor; interleukin 4; rag1 protein; rna 16s; gamma interferon; gamma interferon receptor; homeodomain protein; interferon receptor; interleukin 4; rag-1 protein; rna 16s; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial load; bacterium identification; bacteroides; bifidobacterium; cage; clostridium; clostridium coccoides; clostridium leptum; controlled study; enterobacteriaceae; enterococcus; female; gene; gene expression; gene identification; heterozygosity; homozygosity; housing; ifngamma gene; ifngamma receptor gene; il4 gene; immune deficiency; individual ventilated cage; intestine flora; lactobacillus; mouse model; mutational analysis; nonhuman; open cage; prevotella; quantitative study; rag1 gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rna analysis; species composition; species difference; species dominance; specific pathogen free cage; upregulation; wild type; animal; animal housing; c57bl mouse; comparative study; feces; genetics; immunology; intestine flora; knockout mouse; microbiology; mouse; physiology; real time polymerase chain reaction; mus; animals; bacteroides; feces; female; gastrointestinal microbiome; homeodomain proteins; housing, animal; interferon-gamma; interleukin-4; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; real-time polymerase chain reaction; receptors, interferon; rna, ribosomal, 16s"
"A role for intestinal alkaline phosphatase in preventing liver fibrosis","Liu Y, Cavallaro PM, Kim B-M, Liu T, Wang H, Kühn F, Adiliaghdam F, Liu E, Vasan R, Samarbafzadeh E, Farber MZ, Li J, Xu M, Mohad V, Choi M, Hodin RA",2020,"Article","10.7150/THNO.48468","Rationale: Liver fibrosis is frequently associated with gut barrier dysfunction, and the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) -TLR4 pathway is common to the development of both. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) has the ability to detoxify LPS, as well as maintain intestinal tight junction proteins and gut barrier integrity. Therefore, we hypothesized that IAP may function as a novel therapy to prevent liver fibrosis. Methods: Stool IAP activity from cirrhotic patients were determined. Common bile duct ligation (CBDL) and Carbon Tetrachloride-4 (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis models were used in WT, IAP knockout (KO), and TLR4 KO mice supplemented with or without exogenous IAP in their drinking water. The gut barrier function and liver fibrosis markers were tested. Results: Human stool IAP activity was decreased in the setting of liver cirrhosis. In mice, IAP activity and genes expression decreased after CBDL and CCl4 exposure. Intestinal tight junction related genes and gut barrier function were impaired in both models of liver fibrosis. Oral IAP supplementation attenuated the decrease in small intestine tight junction protein gene expression and gut barrier function. Liver fibrosis markers were significantly higher in IAP KO compared to WT mice in both models, while oral IAP rescued liver fibrosis in both WT and IAP KO mice. In contrast, IAP supplementation did not attenuate fibrosis in TLR4 KO mice in either model. Conclusions: Endogenous IAP is decreased during liver fibrosis, perhaps contributing to the gut barrier dysfunction and worsening fibrosis. Oral IAP protects the gut barrier and further prevents the development of liver fibrosis via a TLR4-mediated mechanism. © 2021 The author(s).","gut barrier; intestinal alkaline phosphatase; liver fibrosis; tlr4; alkaline phosphatase; carbon tetrachloride; drinking water; intestine enzyme; occludin; protein zo1; protein zo2; protein zo3; tight junction protein; toll like receptor 4; unclassified drug; akp3 protein, mouse; alkaline phosphatase; alpi protein, human; carbon tetrachloride; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; lipopolysaccharide; tight junction protein; tlr4 protein, mouse; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bile duct ligation; carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis; common bile duct; controlled study; enzyme activity; feces; female; gene expression; human; intestine mucosa permeability; knockout mouse; liver fibrosis; liver protection; major clinical study; male; mouse; nonhuman; permeability barrier; tight junction; wild type mouse; animal; chemistry; disease model; genetics; ileum; intestine; ligation; liver cirrhosis; metabolism; middle aged; permeability; surgery; adult; alkaline phosphatase; animals; carbon tetrachloride; common bile duct; disease models, animal; feces; female; gpi-linked proteins; humans; ileum; intestines; ligation; lipopolysaccharides; liver cirrhosis; male; mice; mice, knockout; middle aged; permeability; tight junction proteins; toll-like receptor 4"
"TLR4 signaling and the inhibition of liver hepcidin expression by alcohol","Zmijewski E, Lu S, Harrison-Findik DD",2014,"Article","10.3748/wjg.v20.i34.12161","AIM: To understand the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in the regulation of iron-regulatory hormone, hepcidin by chronic alcohol consumption. METHODS: For chronic alcohol intake studies, TLR4 mutant mice on C3H/HeJ background and wildtype counterpart on C3H/HeOuJ background were pair-fed with regular (control) and ethanol-containing Lieber De Carli liquids diets. Gene expression was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Protein-protein interactions and protein expression were determined by co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting. The occupancy of hepcidin gene promoter was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: Chronic alcohol intake suppressed hepcidin mRNA expression in the livers of wildtype, but not TLR4 mutant, mice. The phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 subunit protein was observed in alcohol-fed wildtype, but not in alcohol-fed TLR4 mutant, mice. Similarly, alcohol induced the binding of NF-κB p50 subunit protein to hepcidin gene promoter in wildtype, but not in TLR4 mutant, mice. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Stat3 in the liver was stronger in alcohol-treated TLR4 mutant mice compared to alcohol-treated wildtype mice. The occupancy of hepcidin gene promoter by Stat3 was observed in alcohol-fed mutant, but not in wildtype, mice. An interaction between NF-κB p65 subunit protein and small heterodimer partner protein (SHP) was observed in the livers of both wildtype and TLR4 mutant mice fed with the control diet, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Alcohol intake elevated cytosolic SHP expression but attenuated its interaction with NF-κB in the liver, which was more prominent in the livers of wildtype compared to TLR4 mutant mice.

"Mitochondrial DNA activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and predisposes to type 1 diabetes in murine model","Carlos D, Costa FRC, Pereira CA, Rocha FA, Yaochite JNU, Oliveira GG, Carneiro FS, Tostes RC, Ramos SG, Zamboni DS, Camara NOS, Ryffel B, Silva JS",2017,"Article","10.3389/fimmu.2017.00164","Although a correlation between polymorphisms of NOD-like receptor family-pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and predisposition to type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been identified, the potential function and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in T1D have not been clarified. The present study shows that non-obese diabetic mice exhibited increased NLRP3, and pro-IL-1β gene expression in pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs). Similar increases in gene expression of NLRP3, apoptosis associated speck like protein (ASC) and pro-IL-1β were induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, diabetic C57BL/6 mice also exhibited increased IL-1β protein expression in the pancreatic tissue at day 7, which remained elevated until day 15. Diabetic mice also showed increased positive caspase-1 macrophages in the PLNs, which were decreased in NLRP3-/- mice, but not in ASC-/- mice, after STZ treatment. NLRP3-and IL-1R-deficient mice, but not ASC-deficient mice, showed reduced incidence of diabetes, less insulitis, lower hyperglycemia, and normal insulin levels compared to wild-type (WT) diabetic mice. Notably, these mice also displayed a decrease in IL-17-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells (Th17 and Tc17) and IFN-γ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells (Th1 and Tc1) in the PLNs. Following STZ treatment to induce T1D, NLRP3-deficient mice also exhibited an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cell and mast cell numbers in the PLNs along with a significant increase in IL-6, IL-10, and IL-4 expression in the pancreatic tissue. Interestingly, diabetic mice revealed increased circulating expression of genes related to mitochondrial DNA, such as cytochrome b and cytochrome c, but not NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (NADH). Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) from diabetic mice, but not from non-diabetic mice, induced significant IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation by WT macrophages, which was reduced in NLRP3-/- macrophages. Finally, mDNA administration in vivo increased Th17/Tc17/Th1/Tc1 cells in the PLNs and precipitated T1D onset, which was abolished in NLRP3-/- mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that mDNA-mediated NLRP3 activation triggers caspase-1-dependent IL-1β production and contributes to pathogenic cellular responses during the development of STZ-induced T1D. © 2017 Carlos, Costa, Pereira, Rocha, Yaochite, Oliveira, Carneiro, Tostes, Ramos, Zamboni, Camara, Ryffel and Silva.","cytokines; ifnγ-producing cd4 t cells (th1); ifnγ-producing cd8 t cells (tc1); il-17-producing cd4 t cells (th17); il-17-producing cd8 t cells (tc17); nlrp3 inflammasome; type 1 diabetes; cryopyrin; cytochrome b; cytochrome c; gamma interferon; inflammasome; insulin; interleukin 1 receptor; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; mitochondrial dna; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); streptozocin; animal cell; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; controlled study; dna isolation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulitis; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; th17 cell; upregulation; weight reduction; western blotting"
"P-glycoprotein induction by breast milk attenuates intestinal inflammation in experimental necrotizing enterocolitis","Guner YS, Franklin AL, Chokshi NK, Castle SL, Pontarelli E, Wang J, Wang L, Prasadarao NV, Upperman JS, Grishin AV, Ford HR",2011,"Article","10.1038/labinvest.2011.113","P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a product of the multi-drug resistance gene MDR1a, is a broad specificity efflux ATP cassette transmembrane transporter that is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues. Because mdr1a / mice tend to develop spontaneous colitis in bacteria-dependent manner, Pgp is believed to have a role in protection of the intestinal epithelium from luminal bacteria. Here we demonstrate that levels of Pgp in the small intestine of newborn rodents dramatically increase during breastfeeding, but not during formula feeding (FF). In rats and mice, levels of intestinal Pgp peak on days 3-7 and 1-5 of breastfeeding, respectively. The mdr1a / neonatal mice subjected to FF, hypoxia, and hypothermia have significantly higher incidence and pathology, as well as significantly earlier onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) than congenic wild type mice. Breast-fed mdr1a / neonatal mice are also more susceptible to intestinal damage caused by the opportunistic pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii that has been associated with hospital outbreaks of NEC. Breast milk, but not formula, induces Pgp expression in enterocyte cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. High levels of ectopically expressed Pgp protect epithelial cells in vitro from apoptosis induced by C. sakazakii. Taken together, these results show that breast milk-induced expression of Pgp may have a role in the protection of the neonatal intestinal epithelium from injury associated with nascent bacterial colonization. © 2007 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.","bacteria; breast milk; intestinal epithelium; necrotizing enterocolitis; p-glycoprotein; epidermal growth factor; glycoprotein p; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; article; artificial milk; breast feeding; breast milk; cell line; disease predisposition; enteritis; enterobacter sakazakii; epithelium cell; female; gene; hypothermia; hypoxia; in vitro study; intestine cell; intestine injury; multiple drug resistance 1a gene; necrotizing enterocolitis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein induction; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; western blotting; animals; animals, newborn; blotting, western; cronobacter sakazakii; dna primers; enterobacteriaceae infections; enterocolitis, necrotizing; female; fluorescent antibody technique; gene expression regulation, developmental; inflammation; intestine, small; mice; mice, knockout; milk; milk substitutes; p-glycoproteins; plasmids; rats; real-time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; statistics, nonparametric; transfection"
"Toll-like receptor 4 modulates small intestine neuromuscular function through nitrergic and purinergic pathways","Caputi V, Marsilio I, Cerantola S, Roozfarakh M, Lante I, Galuppini F, Rugge M, Napoli E, Giulivi C, Orso G, Giron MC",2017,"Article","10.3389/fphar.2017.00350","Objective: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the homeostatic microflora-host crosstalk. TLR4-mediated modulation of both motility and enteric neuronal survival has been reported mainly for colon with limited information on the role of TLR4 in tuning structural and functional integrity of enteric nervous system (ENS) and in controlling small bowel motility. Methods: Male TLR4 knockout (TLR4-/-, 9 ± 1 weeks old) and sex- and age-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were used for the experiments. Alterations in ENS morphology and neurochemical code were assessed by immunohistochemistry whereas neuromuscular function was evaluated by isometric mechanical activity of ileal preparations following receptor and non-receptor-mediated stimuli and by gastrointestinal transit. Results: The absence of TLR4 induced gliosis and reduced the total number of neurons, mainly nNOS+ neurons, in ileal myenteric plexus. Furthermore, a lower cholinergic excitatory response with an increased inhibitory neurotransmission was found together with a delayed gastrointestinal transit. These changes were dependent on increased ileal non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxations mediated by a complex neuronal-glia signaling constituted by P2X7 and P2Y1 receptors, and NO produced by nNOS and iNOS. Conclusion: We provide novel evidence that TLR4 signaling is involved in the fine-tuning of P2 receptors controlling ileal contractility, ENS cell distribution, and inhibitory NANC neurotransmission via the combined action of NO and adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). For the first time, this study implicates TLR4 at regulating the crosstalk between glia and neurons in small intestine and helps to define its role in gastrointestinal motor abnormalities during dysbiosis. © 2017 Caputi, Marsilio, Cerantola, Roozfarakh, Lante, Galuppini, Rugge, Napoli, Giulivi, Orso and Giron.","enteric nervous system; gut microbiota; innate immunity; intestinal motility; intestinal transit; knockout mice; small bowel; toll-like receptor 4; adenosine triphosphate; inducible nitric oxide synthase; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; purinergic p2x7 receptor; purinergic p2y1 receptor; purinergic receptor; toll like receptor 4; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell count; cell membrane permeability; cell survival; cellular distribution; cholinergic activity; controlled study; gastrointestinal transit; gliosis; immunohistochemistry; intestine function; intestine innervation; intestine motility; male; molecular interaction; mouse; neuromuscular function; neurotransmission; nitrergic nerve cell; nonhuman; protein function; signal transduction"
"Interactions between ticks and lyme disease spirochetes","Pal U, Kitsou C, Drecktrah D, Büyüktanir Yaş Ö, Fikrig E",2021,"Article","10.21775/cimb.042.113","Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato causes Lyme borreliosis in a variety of animals and humans. These atypical bacterial pathogens are maintained in a complex enzootic life cycle that primarily involves a vertebrate host and Ixodes spp. ticks. In the Northeastern United States, I. scapularis is the main vector, while wild rodents serve as the mammalian reservoir host. As B. burgdorferi is transmitted only by I. scapularis and closely related ticks, the spirochete-tick interactions are thought to be highly specific. Various borrelial and arthropod proteins that directly or indirectly contribute to the natural cycle of B. burgdorferi infection have been identified. Discrete molecular interactions between spirochetes and tick components also have been discovered, which often play critical roles in pathogen persistence and transmission by the arthropod vector. This review will focus on the past discoveries and future challenges that are relevant to our understanding of the molecular interactions between B. burgdorferi and Ixodes ticks. This information will not only impact scientific advancements in the research of tick- transmitted infections but will also contribute to the development of novel preventive measures that interfere with the B. burgdorferi life cycle. © 2022, Caister Academic Press.

"Investigating the Campylobacter jejuni transcriptional response to host intestinal extracts reveals the involvement of a widely conserved iron uptake system","Liu MM, Boinett CJ, Chan ACK, Parkhill J, Murphy MEP, Gaynor EC",2018,"Article","10.1128/mBio.01347-18","Campylobacter jejuni is a pathogenic bacterium that causes gastroenteri-tis in humans yet is a widespread commensal in wild and domestic animals, particularly poultry. Using RNA sequencing, we assessed C. jejuni transcriptional responses to medium supplemented with human fecal versus chicken cecal extracts and in extract-supplemented medium versus medium alone. C. jejuni exposed to extracts had altered expression of 40 genes related to iron uptake, metabolism, chemotaxis, energy production, and osmotic stress response. In human fecal versus chicken cecal extracts, C. jejuni displayed higher expression of genes involved in respiration (fdhTU) and in known or putative iron uptake systems (cfbpA, ceuB, chuC, and CJJ81176_1649–1655 [here designated 1649–1655]). The 1649–1655 genes and downstream overlapping gene 1656 were investigated further. Uncharacterized homologues of this system were identified in 33 diverse bacterial species representing 6 different phyla, 21 of which are associated with human disease. The 1649 and 1650 (p19) genes encode an iron transporter and a periplasmic iron binding protein, respectively; however, the role of the downstream 1651–1656 genes was unknown. A ∆1651–1656 deletion strain had an iron-sensitive phenotype, consistent with a previously characterized ∆p19 mutant, and showed reduced growth in acidic medium, increased sensitivity to streptomycin, and higher resistance to H 2 O 2 stress. In iron-restricted medium, the 1651–1656 and p19 genes were required for optimal growth when using human fecal extracts as an iron source. Collectively, this implicates a function for the 1649–1656 gene cluster in C. jejuni iron scavenging and stress survival in the human intestinal environment. IMPORTANCE Direct comparative studies of C. jejuni infection of a zoonotic commensal host and a disease-susceptible host are crucial to understanding the causes of infection outcome in humans. These studies are hampered by the lack of a disease-susceptible animal model reliably displaying a similar pathology to human campylobacteriosis. In this work, we compared the phenotypic and transcriptional responses of C. jejuni to intestinal compositions of humans (disease-susceptible host) and chickens (zoonotic host) by using human fecal and chicken cecal extracts. The mammalian gut is a complex and dynamic system containing thousands of metabolites that contribute to host health and modulate pathogen activity. We identified C. jejuni genes more highly expressed during exposure to human fecal extracts in comparison to chicken cecal extracts and differentially expressed in extracts compared with medium alone, and targeted one specific iron uptake system for further molecular, genetic, and phenotypic study. © 2018 Liu et al.","acid resistance; campylobacter jejuni; chicken cecal extract; human fecal extract; iron transport; p19; rna-seq; streptomycin resistance; transcriptome; hydrogen peroxide; streptomycin; iron; streptomycin; transcriptome; adult; animal tissue; antibiotic resistance; article; bacterial cell; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterial survival; biofilm; campylobacter jejuni; cecum; cell viability; ceub gene; cfbpa gene; chuc gene; controlled study; fdhtu gene; feces; female; gene cluster; gene expression; gene identification; gene locus; gene product; genetic conservation; human; human tissue; male; middle aged; minimum inhibitory concentration; mutant; nonhuman; operon; overlapping gene; oxidative stress; priority journal; rna sequence; start codon; wild type; young adult; animal; campylobacter jejuni; chemistry; chicken; comparative study; culture medium; drug effect; drug mixture; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; pharmacology; phenotype; sequence analysis; animals; campylobacter jejuni; cecum; chickens; complex mixtures; culture media; drug resistance, bacterial; feces; gene expression regulation, bacterial; humans; iron; phenotype; sequence analysis, rna; streptomycin; transcriptome"
"Arsenic metabolism in mice carrying a borcs7/as3mt locus humanized by syntenic replacement","Koller BH, Snouwaert JN, Douillet C, Jania LA, El-Masri H, Thomas DJ, Stýblo M",2020,"Article","10.1289/EHP6943","BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a significant public health problem. Methylation of iAs by arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) controls iAs detoxification and modifies risks of iAs-induced diseases. Mechanisms underlying these diseases have been extensively studied using animal models. However, substantive differences between humans and laboratory animals in efficiency of iAs methylation have hindered the translational potential of the laboratory studies. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine whether humanization of the As3mt gene confers a human-like pattern of iAs metabolism in mice. METHODS: We generated a mouse strain in which the As3mt gene along with the adjacent Borcs7 gene was humanized by syntenic replacement. We compared expression of the mouse As3mt and the human AS3MT and the rate and pattern of iAs metabolism in the wild-type and humanized mice. RESULTS: AS3MT expression in mouse tissues closely modeled that of human and differed substantially from expression of As3mt. Detoxification of iAs was much less efficient in the humanized mice than in wild-type mice. Profiles for iAs and its methylated metabolites in tissues and excreta of the humanized mice were consistent with those reported in humans. Notably, the humanized mice expressed both the full-length AS3MT that catalyzes iAs methylation and the human-specific AS3MTd2d3 splicing variant that has been linked to schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AS3MT is the primary genetic locus responsible for the unique pattern of iAs metabolism in humans. Thus, the humanized mouse strain can be used to study the role of iAs methylation in the pathogenesis of iAs-induced diseases, as well as to evaluate the role of AS3MTd2d3 in schizophrenia. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Helicobacter pylori, a persistent bacterial colonizer of the human stomach, can alter its surface Lewis (Le) antigen expression. We examined H. pylori colonization in mice to test the hypothesis that host phenotype selects for H. pylori (Le) phenotypes. When wild-type and Leb-expressing transgenic FVB/N mice were challenged with H. pylori strain HP1, expressing Lex and Ley, we found that bacterial populations recovered after 8 mo from Le b-transgenic, but not wild-type, mice expressed Leb. Changes in Le phenotype were linked to variation of a putative galactosyltransferase gene (β-(1,3)galT); mutagenesis and complementation revealed its essential role in type I antigen expression. These studies indicate that H. pylori evolves to resemble the host's gastric Le phenotype, and reveal a bacterial genetic locus that is subject to host-driven selection pressure. © 2009 Pohl et al.","; bacterium antibody; galactosyltransferase; 3 aminopropyl fucopyranosyl 1 2 galactopyranosyl 1 3 (fucopyranosyl 1 4) 2 acetamido 2 deoxyglucopyranosyl 1 3 galactopyranosyl 1 4 glucopyranoside; 3-aminopropyl fucopyranosyl-1-2-galactopyranosyl-1-3-(fucopyranosyl-1-4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranosyl-1-3-galactopyranosyl-1-4-glucopyranoside; adhesin; baba protein, helicobacter pylori; bacterium antibody; cd15 antigen; fucosyltransferase; galactosyltransferase; lewis y antigen; lipopolysaccharide; oligosaccharide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody response; antigen expression; article; bacterial colonization; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; blood group lewis system; controlled study; dna sequence; genetic complementation; genetic variability; helicobacter pylori; host pathogen interaction; humoral immunity; microbial community; mouse; mutagenesis; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; provocation test; sequence analysis; transgenic mouse; wild type; animal; blood; blood group lewis system; flow cytometry; genetics; immunology; physiology; adhesins, bacterial; animals; antibodies, bacterial; antigens, cd15; flow cytometry; fucosyltransferases; galactosyltransferases; helicobacter pylori; lewis blood-group system; lipopolysaccharides; mice; mice, transgenic; oligosaccharides; phenotype"

To overcome this, the koala ( Phascolarctos cinereus) has evolved a range of anatomical and physiological adaptations to assist with digestion and absorption of nutrients from this food source. Microbial fermentation of partially digested eucalyptus leaves is thought to be critical in this process, however, little is known about the composition and diversity of microorganisms that are associated with digestive health in this native species. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing of caecum, colon and faecal pellet samples from two wild, free ranging, Queensland koalas.
