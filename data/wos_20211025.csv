They have complex ecological adaptation mechanisms to adapt to perennial underground life. Intestinal microbes play an important role in the ecological adaptation of wild animals. The gut microbiota diversity and its function in short-faced moles' ecological adaptation is a scientific issue worth exploring. In this study, the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform was used to sequence the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA genes of 22 short-faced moles' intestinal samples to study the composition and functional structure of their intestinal microbiota. The results showed that in the short-faced moles' intestine, there are four main phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidete. At the family level, Peptostreptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae have the highest abundance. At the genus level, Romboutsia is the genus with the highest microbial abundance. According to the KEGG database, the main functions of short-faced mole gut microbes are metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and cellular processes. The function of short-faced mole intestinal microbiota is suitable for its long-term burrowing life. No gender difference is found in the composition and function of the short-faced mole intestinal microbiota. There are significant differences in the composition and functional structure of the short-faced mole gut microbiota between samples collected from different habitats. We conferred that this is related to the different environment factors in which they live, especially to the edaphic factors.","[Chen, Lei; Xu, Di; Zhu, Jing; Wang, Shen; Liu, Mi; Sun, Mengyao; Wang, Geyang; Song, Lingyu; Liu, Xiaoyu; Xie, Tianyu] Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Jingxuan West St 57, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China","Chen, L (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Jingxuan West St 57, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China.",leisurechen@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31400473]; Science and Technology Plan Project for Colleges and Universities in Shandong Province of China [J14LE16],"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31400473), and the Science and Technology Plan Project for Colleges and Universities in Shandong Province of China (J14LE16).",,41,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2191-0855,,,AMB EXPRESS,AMB Express,JUN 23,2021,11,1,,,,,,,93,10.1186/s13568-021-01252-2,,,12,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,TC4MH,WOS:000668614100001,34164757,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-10-25,

But captivity alters the microbiome and mammals have unique biological adaptations that affect their microbiomes (e.g., milk). Birds represent over 30% of known tetrapod diversity and possess their own suite of adaptations relevant to the microbiome. In a previous study, we showed that 59 species of birds displayed immense variation in their microbiomes and host (bird) taxonomy and ecology were most correlated with the gut microbiome. In this Frontiers Focused Review, I put those results in a broader context by discussing how collecting and analyzing wild microbiomes contributes to the main goals of evolutionary biology and the specific ways that birds are unique microbial hosts. Finally, I outline some of the methodological considerations for adding microbiome sampling to the research of wild animals and urge researchers to do so. To truly understand the evolution of a host, we need to understand the millions of microorganisms that inhabit it as well: evolutionary biology needs wild microbiomes.","[Hird, Sarah M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Hird, SM (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",sarah.hird@uconn.edu,,"Hird, Sarah/0000-0002-1998-9387",University of Connecticut; University of California Davis Chancellor's Post-doctoral Fellowship,The author wishes to thank the University of Connecticut and the University of California Davis Chancellor's Post-doctoral Fellowship for funding.,,107,84,85,4,55,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Salmonella-contaminated poultry products are one of the major sources of salmonellosis. Given the critical role of the gut microbiota in Salmonella transmission, a manipulation of the chicken intestinal microenvironment could prevent animal colonization by the pathogen. In Salmonella, the global regulator gene fnr (fumarate nitrate reduction) regulates anaerobic metabolism and is essential for adapting to the gut environment. This study tested the hypothesis that an attenuated Fnr mutant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (attST) or prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) could improve resistance to wild-type Salmonella via modifications to the structure of the chicken gut microbiome. Intestinal samples from a total of 273 animals were collected weekly for 9 weeks to evaluate the impact of attST or prebiotic supplementation on microbial species of the cecum, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. We next analyzed changes to the gut microbiome induced by challenging the animals with a wild-type Salmonella serovar 4,[ 5], 12: r: - (Nalr) strain and determined the clearance rate of the virulent strain in the treated and control groups. Both GOS and the attenuated Salmonella strain modified the gut microbiome but elicited alterations of different taxonomic groups. The attST produced significant increases of Alistipes and undefined Lactobacillus, while GOS increased Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillus reuteri. The microbiome structural changes induced by both treatments resulted in a faster clearance after a Salmonella challenge. IMPORTANCE With an average annual incidence of 13.1 cases/100,000 individuals, salmonellosis has been deemed a nationally notifiable condition in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Earlier studies demonstrated that Salmonella is transmitted by a subset of animals (supershedders). The supershedder phenotype can be induced by antibiotics, ascertaining an essential role for the gut microbiota in Salmonella transmission. Consequently, modulation of the gut microbiota and modification of the intestinal microenvironment could assist in preventing animal colonization by the pathogen. Our study demonstrated that a manipulation of the chicken gut microbiota by the administration of an attenuated Salmonella strain or prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can promote resistance to Salmonella colonization via increases of beneficial microorganisms that translate into a less hospitable gut microenvironment.","[Azcarate-Peril, M.

Certain host traits can influence which microbial taxa comprise the microbiota. One potentially important trait in vertebrate animals is the adaptive immune system, which has been hypothesized to act as an ecological filter, promoting the presence of some microbial taxa over others. Here we surveyed the intestinal microbiota of 68 wild-type zebrafish, with functional adaptive immunity, and 61 rag1(-) zebrafish, lacking functional B- and T-cell receptors, to test the role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the intestinal microbiota. In addition, we tested the robustness of adaptive immunity's filtering effects to host-host interaction by comparing the microbiota of fish populations segregated by genotype to those containing both genotypes. The presence of adaptive immunity individualized the gut microbiota and decreased the contributions of neutral processes to gut microbiota assembly. Although mixing genotypes led to increased phylogenetic diversity in each, there was no significant effect of adaptive immunity on gut microbiota composition in either housing condition. Interestingly, the most robust effect on microbiota composition was co-housing within a tank. In all, these results suggest that adaptive immunity has a role as an ecological filter of the zebrafish gut microbiota, but it can be overwhelmed by other factors, including transmission of microbes among hosts.","[Stagaman, Keaton; Burns, Adam R.; Bohannan, Brendan J.

How the gut microbiome structure of these animals will change in response receives increasing attention. The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi), a typic subterranean rodent endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, spends almost the whole life underground and is well adapted to the environmental pressures of both plateau and underground. However, how the gut microbiome of the plateau zokor will change in response to captivity has not been reported to date. This study compared the microbial community structure and functions of 22 plateau zokors before (the WS group) and after being kept in captivity for 15 days (the LS group, fed on carrots) using the 16S rRNA gene via high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the LS group retained 973 of the 977 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the WS group, and no new OTUs were found in the LS group. The dominant bacterial phyla were Bacteroides and Firmicutes in both groups. In alpha diversity analysis, the Shannon, Sobs, and ACE indexes of the LS group were significantly lower than those of the WS group. A remarkable difference (P < 0.01) between groups was also detected in beta diversity analysis. The UPGMA clustering, NMDS, PCoA, and Anosim results all showed that the intergroup difference was significantly greater than the intragroup difference. And compared with the WS group, the intragroup difference of the gut microbiota in the LS group was much larger, which failed to support the assumption that similar diets should drive convergence of gut microbial communities. PICRUSt revealed that although some functional categories displayed significant differences between groups, the relative abundances of these categories were very close in both groups. Based on all the results, we conclude that as plateau zokors enter captivity for a short time, although the relative abundances of different gut microbiota categories shifted significantly, they can maintain almost all the OTUs and the functions of the gut microbiota in the wild. So, the use of wild-caught plateau zokors in gut microbial studies is acceptable if the time in captivity is short.","[Liu, Daoxin; Song, Pengfei; Wang, Haijing; Cai, Zhenyuan; Zhang, Tongzuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810001, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Daoxin] Qinghai Univ, Kunlun Coll, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Daoxin; Song, Pengfei; Wang, Haijing; Cai, Zhenyuan; Zhang, Tongzuo] Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Daoxin; Song, Pengfei; Wang, Haijing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jingyan; Xie, Jiuxiang] Qinghai Univ, Coll Agr & Anim Husb, 251 Ningda Rd, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China","Zhang, TZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810001, Qinghai, Peoples R China.; Xie, JX (corresponding author), Qinghai Univ, Coll Agr & Anim Husb, 251 Ningda Rd, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",xiejx@qhu.edu.cn; zhangtz@nwipb.cas.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31760622]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0506405]; Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program [2019-SF-150]; Applied Basic Research Program of Qinghai Science and Technology Department [2019-ZJ-7069],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31760622); the National Key R&D Program of China (no. 2017YFC0506405); the Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program (no. 2019-SF-150), and the Applied Basic Research Program of Qinghai Science and Technology Department (2019-ZJ-7069).",,71,0,0,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1176-9343,,,EVOL BIOINFORM,Evol.

However, outside of dietary shifts, other potential environmental drivers of gut microbial composition have rarely been investigated, particularly in organisms living in their natural environments. Results Here, we generated the largest wild nonhuman primate gut microbiome dataset to date to identify the environmental drivers of gut microbial diversity and function in 758 samples collected from wild Ethiopian geladas (Theropithecus gelada). Because geladas live in a cold, high-altitude environment and have a low-quality grass-based diet, they face extreme thermoregulatory and energetic constraints. We tested how proxies of food availability (rainfall) and thermoregulatory stress (temperature) predicted gut microbiome composition of geladas. The gelada gut microbiome composition covaried with rainfall and temperature in a pattern that suggests distinct responses to dietary and thermoregulatory challenges. Microbial changes were driven by differences in the main components of the diet across seasons: in rainier periods, the gut was dominated by cellulolytic/fermentative bacteria that specialized in digesting grass, while during dry periods the gut was dominated by bacteria that break down starches found in underground plant parts. Temperature had a comparatively smaller, but detectable, effect on the gut microbiome. During cold and dry periods, bacterial genes involved in energy, amino acid, and lipid metabolism increased, suggesting a stimulation of fermentation activity in the gut when thermoregulatory and nutritional stress co-occurred, and potentially helping geladas to maintain energy balance during challenging periods. Conclusion Together, these results shed light on the extent to which gut microbiota plasticity provides dietary and metabolic flexibility to the host, and might be a key factor to thriving in changing environments. On a longer evolutionary timescale, such metabolic flexibility provided by the gut microbiome may have also allowed members of Theropithecus to adopt a specialized diet, and colonize new high-altitude grassland habitats in East Africa.","[Baniel, Alice; Lu, Amy] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Amato, Katherine R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Beehner, Jacinta C.; Bergman, Thore J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Beehner, Jacinta C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bergman, Thore J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mercer, Arianne; Sams, Sierra; Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Perlman, Rachel F.; Petrullo, Lauren] SUNY Stony Brook, Interdept Doctoral Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Reitsema, Laurie] Univ Georgia, Dept Anthropol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Evolut & Med, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Snyder-Mackler, Noah] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Baniel, A; Lu, A (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.; Snyder-Mackler, N (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",alice.baniel@gmail.com; amy.lu@stonybrook.edu; nsnyderm@asu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-1723228, BCS-1723237, BCS-2010309, BCS-0715179, BCS-1732231, IOS-1255974, IOS-1854359]; L.S.B.

Recently, we demonstrated that perinatal exposure to vancomycin, but not streptomycin, profoundly alters gut microbiota and enhances susceptibility to a T(H)2 model of allergic asthma. Objective: Here we sought to further clarify the etiology of these changes by determining whether perinatal antibiotic treatment has a similar effect on the T(H)1/T(H)17-mediated lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Methods: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis was induced in C57BL/6 wild-type or recombination-activating gene 1-deficient mice treated perinatally with vancomycin or streptomycin by repeated intranasal administration of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula antigen. Disease severity was assessed by measuring lung inflammation, pathology, cytokine responses, and serumantibodies. Microbial community analyses were performed on stool samples via 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and correlations between disease severity and specific bacterial taxa were identified. Results: Surprisingly, in contrast to our findings in an allergic asthma model, we found that the severity of hypersensitivity pneumonitis was unaffected by vancomycin, but increased dramatically after streptomycin treatment. This likely reflects an effect on the adaptive, rather than innate, immune response because the effects of streptomycin were not observed during the early phases of disease and were abrogated in recombination-activating gene 1-deficient mice. Interestingly, Bacteroidetes dominated the intestinal microbiota of streptomycin-treated animals, while vancomycin promoted the expansion of the Firmicutes. Conclusions: Perinatal antibiotics exert highly selective effects on resident gut flora, which, in turn, lead to very specific alterations in susceptibility to T(H)2-or T(H)1/T(H)17-driven lung inflammatory disease.","[Russell, Shannon L.; Dimitriu, Pedro; Redpath, Stephen A.; Perona-Wright, Georgia; Mohn, William W.; Finlay, B.

To date, few longitudinal studies have investigated the causes and consequences of microbiota variation in wildlife, although such studies provide a comparative context for interpreting the adaptive significance of findings from studies on humans or captive animals. Here, we investigate the impact of seasonality, diet, group membership, sex, age, and reproductive state on gut microbiota composition in a wild population of group-living, frugi-folivorous primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). We repeatedly sampled 32 individually recognizable animals from eight adjacent groups over the course of two different climatic seasons. We used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the microbiota composition of 187 fecal samples. We demonstrate a clear pattern of seasonal variation in the intestinal microbiota, especially affecting the Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratio, which may be driven by seasonal differences in diet. The relative abundances of certain polysaccharide-fermenting taxa, for example, Lachnospiraceae, were correlated with fruit and fiber consumption. Additionally, group membership influenced microbiota composition independent of season, but further studies are needed to determine whether this pattern is driven by group divergences in diet, social contacts, or genetic factors. In accordance with findings in other wild mammals and primates with seasonally fluctuating food availability, we demonstrate seasonal variation in the microbiota of wild Verreaux's sifakas, which may be driven by food availability. This study adds to mounting evidence that variation in the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the ability of primates to cope with seasonal variation in food availability.","[Springer, Andrea; Fichtel, Claudia; Koch, Flavia; Kappeler, Peter M.] German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany; [Springer, Andrea] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Ctr Infect Med, Inst Parasitol, Hannover, Germany; [Al-Ghalith, Gabriel A.] Univ Minnesota, Biomed Informat & Computat Biol, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Koch, Flavia] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Psychol, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Amato, Katherine R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Clayton, Jonathan B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Vet & Biomed Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Clayton, Jonathan B.] GreenViet Biodivers Conservat Ctr, Son Tra Dist, Danang, Vietnam; [Knights, Dan] Univ Minnesota, Inst Biotechnol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Knights, Dan] Univ Minnesota, Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Kappeler, Peter M.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany","Springer, A (corresponding author), German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany.; Springer, A (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Hannover, Ctr Infect Med, Inst Parasitol, Hannover, Germany.",andrea.springer@tiho-hannover.de,,"Clayton, Jonathan/0000-0003-3709-3362",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Ka1082/29-1]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH/NIDA T32 DA007097-32]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [T32DA007097] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/ Award Number: Ka1082/29-1; National Institutes of Health, Grant/ Award Number: NIH/NIDA T32 DA007097-32",,72,38,38,4,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

It is, therefore, imperative that we understand the consequences of and mechanisms by which, species can respond to it. In recent years, research has shown that plasticity of the gut microbiome may be an important mechanism by which animals can adapt to environmental change, yet empirical evidence of this in wild non-model species remains sparse. Using an empirical replicated study system, we show that city life alters the gut microbiome and stable isotope profiling of a wild native non-model species - the eastern water dragon (Intellagama lesueurii) in Queensland, Australia. City dragons exhibit a more diverse gut microbiome than their native habitat counterparts and show gut microbial signatures of a high fat and plant rich diet. Additionally, we also show that city dragons have elevated levels of the Nitrogen-15 isotope in their blood suggesting that a city diet, which incorporates novel anthropogenic food sources, may also be richer in protein. These results highlight the role that gut microbial plasticity plays in an animals' response to human-altered landscapes.","[Littleford-Colquhoun, Bethan L.; Kent, Nicola; Frere, Celine H.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Global Change Ecol Res Grp, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Weyrich, Laura S.] Univ Adelaide, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Dept Genet & Evolut, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Weyrich, Laura S.] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Australian Biodivers & Heritage, Wollongong, NSW, Australia","Littleford-Colquhoun, BL (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.",Bethan.Littleford-Colquhoun@research.usc.edu.au,"Frere, Celine/B-4905-2013; Littleford-Colquhoun, Bethan/AAG-1821-2019","Frere, Celine/0000-0002-9671-2138; Littleford-Colquhoun, Bethan/0000-0002-2594-0061; Weyrich, Laura/0000-0001-5243-4634; Kent, Nicola/0000-0002-3082-6829",,,,97,5,5,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Here, we controlled for these other confounding factors in our investigation of the magnitude of the effect of diet on the gut microbiome assemblies of nonpasserine birds. We collected fecal samples, at one point in time, from 35 species of birds in a single zoo as well as 6 species of domestic poultry from farms in Guangzhou city to minimize the influences from interfering factors. Specifically, we describe 16S rRNA amplicon data from 129 fecal samples obtained from 41 species of birds, with additional shotgun metagenomic sequencing data generated from 16 of these individuals. Our data show that diets containing native starch increase the abundance of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiome, while those containing plantderived fiber mainly enrich the level of Clostridium. Greater numbers of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria are detected in carnivorous birds, while in birds fed a commercial cornsoybean basal diet, a stronger inner-connected microbial community containing Clostridia and Bacteroidia was enriched. Furthermore, the metagenome functions of the microbes (such as lipid metabolism and amino acid synthesis) were adapted to the different food types to achieve a beneficial state for the host. In conclusion, the covariation of diet and gut microbiome identified in our study demonstrates a modulation of the gut microbiome by dietary diversity and helps us better understand how birds live based on dietmicrobiome-host interactions. IMPORTANCE Our study identified food source, rather than host phylogeny, as the main factor modulating the gut microbiome diversity of nonpasserine birds, after minimizing the effects of other complex interfering factors such as weather, season, and geography. Adaptive evolution of microbes to food types formed a dietary-microbiomehost interaction reciprocal state. The covariation of diet and gut microbiome, including the response of microbiota assembly to diet in structure and function, is important for health and nutrition in animals. Our findings help resolve the major modulators of gut microbiome diversity in nonpasserine birds, which had not previously been well studied. The diet-microbe interactions and cooccurrence patterns identified in our study may be of special interest for future health assessment and conservation in birds.","[Xiao, Kangpeng; Shen, Yongyi] Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Kangpeng; Fan, Yutan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Shen, Xuejuan; Li, Xiaobing; Liang, Xianghui; Bi, Ran; Shen, Yongyi] South China Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yajiang; Zhai, Junqiong; Dai, Junwei; Chen, Wu] Guangzhou Zoo, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Irwin, David M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Irwin, David M.] Univ Toronto, Banting & Best Diabet Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Shen, Yongyi] Key Lab Zoonosis Prevent & Control Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Shen, YY (corresponding author), Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.; Shen, YY (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.; Chen, W (corresponding author), Guangzhou Zoo, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.; Shen, YY (corresponding author), Key Lab Zoonosis Prevent & Control Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",guangzhouchenwu@sina.com; shenyy@scau.edu.cn,,,"Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research [2020B0301030007]; Guangdong Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Program [2019TX05N098]; 111 ProjectMinistry of Education, China - 111 Project [D20008]; Department of Education of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2019KZDXM004, 2019KCXTD001]; Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province [2020B1111320002]; Department of Agriculture of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research (no. 2020B0301030007) , Guangdong Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talent Program (2019TX05N098) , the 111 Project (D20008) , and funds from the Department of Education of Guangdong Province (2019KZDXM004 and 2019KCXTD001) , Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (2020B1111320002) , and Department of Agriculture of Guangdong Province.",,69,2,2,6,6,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",2379-5042,,,MSPHERE,mSphere,MAY-JUN,2021,6,3,,,,,,,e00308-21,10.1128/mSphere.00308-21,,,13,Microbiology,Microbiology,SD8QM,WOS:000651640900002,33980682,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-10-25,

Reintroduction, as an effective strategy for wild population recovery and genetic diversity maintenance for endangered populations, usually takes captive populations as rewilding resource. While, little is known about the compositional and functional differences of gut microbiota between captive and wild populations, especially for large carnivores, like Amur tiger. In this study, high throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (amplicon sequencing) and metagenomics were used to analyze the composition and function variations of gut microbiota communities between captive and wild Amur tiger populations based on total 35 fecal samples (13 from captive tigers and 22 from wild tigers). Our results showed that captive Amur tigers have higher alpha diversity in gut microbiota, but that the average unweighted UniFrac distance of bacterial taxa among wild Amur tigers was much larger. The function differences involve most aspects of the body functions, especially for metabolism, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems. It was indicated that the diet habit and environment difference between captive and wild populations lead to composition differences of gut microbiota and then resulted in significant differences in functions. These contrasts of functional and compositional variations in gut microbiota between wild and captive Amur tigers are essential insights for guiding conservation management and policy decision-making, and call for more attention on the influence of gut microbiota on the ability of captive animals to survive in the wild.","[Ning, Yao; Qi, Jinzhe; Liang, Xin; Wang, Jingxuan; Chen, Shiyu; Ma, Jianzhang; Jiang, Guangshun] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Qi, Jinzhe] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Dobbins, Michael T.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Ma, JZ; Jiang, GS (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China.",jianzhangma@163.com; jgshun@126.com,,"Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017PZ14]; National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31572285, 31872241]; project of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration","This study was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572017PZ14), the National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0503200) and NSFC (31572285; 31872241), and project of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, entitled Survey Standard Compiling and Information Summary of Amur Tiger and Leopard Population and Habitat.",,74,1,1,5,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Specifically, 16S rRNA gene and bifidobacterial Internally Transcribed Spacer (ITS) profiling were employed to reconstruct and then compare the canine core gut microbiota to those of wolves and humans, revealing that artificial selection and subsequent cohabitation of dogs with their owners influenced the microbial population of canine gut through loss and acquisition of specific bacterial taxa. Moreover, comparative analysis of the intestinal bacterial population of dogs fed on Bones and Raw Food (BARF) or commercial food (CF) diet, coupled with shotgun metagenomics, highlighted that both bacterial composition and metabolic repertoire of the canine gut microbiota have evolved to adapt to high-protein or high-carbohydrates intake.

Here, DNA from faecal samples was used to investigate the gut microbial compositions and diversity in three host species endemic to the high-altitude Tibetan plateau, the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii, T-antelope, 4300 m) and the Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang, T-ass, 4300 m), and in the Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries, T-sheep) collected from two different altitudes (T-sheep [k], 4300 m and T-sheep [I] 3000 m). Ordinary sheep (O. aries, sheep) from low altitudes (1800 m) were used for comparison. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the genera Ruminococcus (22.78%), Oscillospira (20.00%), and Clostridium (10.00%) were common taxa in all high-altitude species (T-antelope, T-ass and T-sheep [k]). Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, Clostridia, and Firmicutes showed greater enrichment in the T-antelopes' gut microbiota than in the microbiota of lower-altitude sheep (T-sheep [1] and sheep). The T-antelopes' gut microbiota displayed a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes than lower-altitude sheep (T-sheep [1] and sheep). A functional capacity analysis of the paired-end metagenomics sequences of the gut metagenomes of high-altitude T-antelopes and T-sheep annotated over 80% of the unique genes to metabolism (especially carbohydrate metabolism pathways) and genetic information processing in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. The gut metagenome of the T-antelope may have co-evolved with the host genomes (e.g. glycolysis and DNA repair).

However, how animal gut microbial community structure and function adapt to extreme cold climates is not well understood. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is an ideal animal model with which to study the effects of climate change on host adaptation by studing intestinal microorganisms. Here, we used 16S rRNA sequencing technology combined with physiological methods to investigate plateau pika gut microbiota in summer and winter. Due to limited diet resources, the pikas in winter have a lower ability of degradation and fermentation for plant-based food (reduced cellulase activity and total short-chain fatty acids) by decreasing gut microbial diversity and some functional microbes, such as fiber-degrading bacteria Oscillospira and Treponema. Metagenomic prediction showed that most of those gene functions associated with metabolism (e.g. energy metabolism and lipid metabolism) were less abundant in winter, implying that the plateau pika slows diet fermentation and weakens energy requirements in the cold season. Our results have significance for explaining the mechanism of wild plateau mammals adapting to a high-altitude cold environment from the perspective of gut microbiome.","[Wang, Yijie; Zhou, Rui; Yu, Qiaoling; Feng, Tianshu; Li, Huan] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Li, Huan] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China","Li, H (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",lihuanzky@163.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2018-68],The study was supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (lzujbky-2018-68).,,60,3,3,11,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0378-1097,1574-6968,,FEMS MICROBIOL LETT,FEMS Microbiol.

The majority of these studies have focused on bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract, while the fungal community has often been neglected. Gut anaerobic fungi of the class Neocallimastigomycetes are a vital part of the intestinal microbiome in many herbivorous animals and their exceptional abilities to degrade indigestible plant material means that they contribute significantly to fermentative processes in the enteric tract. Gorillas rely on a highly fibrous diet and depend on fermentative microorganisms to meet their daily energetic demands. To assess whether Neocallimastigomycetes occur in gorillas we analyzed 12 fecal samples from wild Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, and subjected potential anaerobic fungi sequences to phylogenetic analysis. The clone library contained ITS1 fragments that we related to 45 different fungi clones. Of these, 12 gastrointestinal fungi in gorillas are related to anaerobic fungi and our phylogenetic analyses support their assignment to the class Neocallimastigomycetes. As anaerobic fungi play a pivotal role in plant fiber degradation in the herbivore gut, gorillas might benefit from harboring these particular fungi with regard to their nutritional status. Future studies should investigate whether Neocallimastigomycetes are also found in other nonhuman primates with high fiber intake, which would also benefit from having such highly efficient fermentative microbes.","[Schulz, Doreen] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Schulz, Doreen; Vallo, Peter; Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Schulz, Doreen; Modry, David] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pathol & Parasitol, Brno 61242, Czech Republic; [Qablan, Moneeb A.] United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Food & Agr, Dept Vet Med, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Profousova-Psenkova, Ilona] Zool Garden Usti Nad Labem, Usti Nad Labem 40007, Czech Republic; [Vallo, Peter] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Fuh, Terence] World Wildlife Fund, Primate Habituat Project, Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, BP 1053, Bangui, Cent Afr Republ; [Modry, David] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, CEITEC VFU, Palackeho Tr 1946-1, Brno 61242, Czech Republic; [Modry, David; Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Czech Acad Sci, Ctr Biol, Inst Parasitol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Piel, Alexander K.; Stewart, Fiona] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Piel, Alexander K.; Stewart, Fiona] Ugalla Primate Project, Uvinza, Tanzania; [Petrzelkova, Klara J.] Liberec Zoo, Liberec 46001, Czech Republic; [Fliegerova, Katerina] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Anim Physiol & Genet, Prague 14220, Czech Republic","Schulz, D (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.; Schulz, D (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.; Schulz, D (corresponding author), Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pathol & Parasitol, Brno 61242, Czech Republic.",doreenschz@gmail.com,"Modry, David/G-7815-2014; Vallo, Peter/F-9650-2014; Petrzelkova, Klara Judita/G-7111-2014","Modry, David/0000-0001-9649-6255; Qablan, Moneeb/0000-0003-3678-5797; Stewart, Fiona/0000-0002-4929-4711",Leakey Foundation; project CEITEC (Central European Institute of Technology) from the European Regional Development Fund [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); state budget of the Czech Republic [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0300];  [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000460 OP RDE],"We are grateful to the government of the Central African Republic as well as the Ministre de l'Education Nationale, de l'Alphabetisation, de l'Enseignement Superieur, et de la Recherche for granting permission to conduct our research within the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic.

Because of human interference, the survival of wild animals is threatened in the face of competition, particularly in co-inhabited grazing pastures. This may lead to differences in the adaptability between wild and domestic animals, as well as nutritional deficiencies in wild animals. The gut microbiota is closely associated with host health, nutrition, and adaptability. However, the gut microbiota diversity and functions in domestic and wild animals in co-inhabited areas are unclear. To reveal the adaptability of wild and domestic animals in co-inhabited areas based on gut microbiota, we assessed the gut microbiota diversity. This study was based on the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA and gut microbiota functions according to the metagenome analysis of fresh fecal samples in wild goitered gazelles (Gazella subgutturosa) and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) in the Qaidam Basin. The wild and domestic species showed significant differences in alpha- and beta-diversities. Specifically, the alpha-diversity was lower in goitered gazelles. We speculated that the nutritional and habitat status of the goitered gazelles were worse. The gut microbiota functions in the gazelles were enriched in metabolism and cellular processes based on the KEGG database. In summary, we reasoned that gut microbiota can improve the adaptability of goitered gazelles through energy maintenance by the functions of gut microbiota in the face of nutritional deficiencies. These findings highlight the importance of gut microbiota diversity to improve the adaptability of goitered gazelles, laying a foundation for the conservation of wild goitered gazelles. In addition, we further provide management suggestions for domestic sheep in co-inhabited grazing pastures.","[Qin, Wen; Song, Pengfei; Huang, YanGan; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Tongzuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Peoples R China; [Qin, Wen; Song, Pengfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Gonghua] Jinggangshan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Jian, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaowen] Lanzhou Zoo, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Shengqing] Qinghai Univ, Qinghai Acad Anim Sci & Vet Med, Xining, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tongzuo] Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Peoples R China","Zhang, TZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Peoples R China.; Zhang, TZ (corresponding author), Qinghai Prov Key Lab Anim Ecol Genom, Xining, Peoples R China.",zhangtz@nwipb.cas.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23060602, XDA2002030302]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0506405]; Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program [2019-SF-150]",This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23060602 and XDA2002030302); the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0506405); and the Qinghai Key R&D and Transformation Program (2019-SF-150).,,131,2,2,3,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota also has a close relationship with reproduction. The wild ground squirrel (Spermophilus dauricus) is a typical seasonal breeding animal. The purpose of this study was to explore the distinct taxonomy and function of the gut microbiota in the breeding and non-breeding seasons of the wild ground squirrel using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. The results show that the taxonomy of gut microbiota was different between the breeding season and non-breeding season. Functional prediction of the gut microbiota indicated that the relative abundance of metabolic pathways was differentially enriched between the breeding season and non-breeding season. This study further revealed the potential relationship between gut microbiota and reproduction and expanded our understanding of the function of gut microbiota. At the same time, it provided a new direction for research on the breeding strategy of seasonal breeding animals. Seasonal breeding is a normal phenomenon in which animals adapt to natural selection and reproduce only in specific seasons. Large studies have reported that the gut microbiota is closely related to reproduction. The purpose of this study was to explore the distinct taxonomy and function of the gut microbiota in the breeding and non-breeding seasons of the wild ground squirrel (Spermophilus dauricus). The 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology was utilized to sequence the gut microbiota of the wild ground squirrel. PICRUSt analysis was also applied to predict the function of the gut microbiota. The results suggested that the main components of the gut microbiota in all samples were Firmicutes (61.8%), Bacteroidetes (32.4%), and Proteobacteria (3.7%). Microbial community composition analyses revealed significant differences between the breeding and non-breeding seasons. At the genus level, Alistipes, Mycoplasma, Anaerotruncus, and Odoribacter were more abundant in the non-breeding season, while Blautia and Streptococcus were more abundant in the breeding season. The results of a functional prediction suggested that the relative abundance of functional categories that were related to lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism increased in the breeding season. The relative abundance of energy metabolism, transcription, and signal transduction increased in the non-breeding season. Overall, this study found differences in the taxonomy and function of the gut microbiota of the wild ground squirrel between the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and laid the foundation for further studies on the relationship between the gut microbiota and seasonal breeding.","[Yang, Xiaoying; Yao, Yuchen; Zhang, Xueying; Zhong, Jiahui; Gao, Fuli; Zhang, Haolin; Han, Yingying; Weng, Qiang; Yuan, Zhengrong] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Yuan, ZR (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",xiaoying_yang@bjfu.edu.cn; charming_yao@outlook.com; wangzai619@bjfu.edu.cn; zhongjiahui@bjfu.edu.cn; fuligao@bjfu.edu.cn; haolinzhang@bjfu.edu.cn; thinkinghyy@bjfu.edu.cn; qiangweng@bjfu.edu.cn; zryuan@bjfu.edu.cn,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018ZY21]; National Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates [202010022079, 202010022072]","This research work is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2018ZY21), and the National Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates (202010022079, 202010022072).",,69,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,SEP,2021,11,9,,,,,,,2685,10.3390/ani11092685,,,12,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences",Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,UU8PE,WOS:000699056100001,34573650,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-10-25,

We studied the gut microbiota composition and function of the wild rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using 16S rRNA sequencing method. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota of the wild rhesus macaques was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes. Diversity and richness of gut microbiota were higher during the dry season than the rainy season. Specifically, higher proportions of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, and unclassified bacteria at the phylum level and moreCoprococcusat the genus level were detected in the dry season. Predictive functional analysis showed that pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism and drug resistance (antimicrobial and antineoplastic) were richer in the dry season. These seasonal differences in microbiota could be due to their heavier dependence on leaf-based diet in the dry season. Additionally, macaques in limestone forests had a higher percentage of Spirochaetes, probably suggesting that the proportion of fruits in dietary composition also play an important role in the gut microbiota. We concluded that diet was strongly linked to the diversity, composition, and function of the gut microbiota in the wild groups of rhesus macaques living in the limestone forest, highlighting the importance of diet in the gut microbiota of macaques and the need to conduct further study on the adaptation strategy in response of environmental changes in the ground of gut microbiota.","[Li, Yuhui; Chen, Ting; Li, Youbang; Huang, Zhonghao] Guangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuhui; Chen, Ting; Li, Youbang; Huang, Zhonghao] Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, 15 Yu Cai Rd, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jipeng] Adm Ctr Guangxi Chongzuo White Headed Langur Natl, Chongzuo, Peoples R China","Li, YB; Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Rare & Endangered Species & Environm, Guilin, Peoples R China.; Li, YB; Huang, ZH (corresponding author), Guangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Rare & Endangered Anim Ecol, 15 Yu Cai Rd, Guilin, Peoples R China.",lyb_2001@126.com; hzh773@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31660616, 31960106, 31960104]; Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province [2018GXNSFAA281029]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31660616, 31960106, 31960104) and the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, China (2018GXNSFAA281029).",,78,0,0,7,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0302-8933,1432-072X,,ARCH MICROBIOL,Arch.

This can generate signals of phylosymbiosis, whereby gut microbiome composition matches host phylogenetic structure. However, the genetic mechanisms that generate phylosymbiosis and the scale at which they act remain unclear. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are that phylosymbiosis is driven by immunogenetic regions such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) controlling microbial composition, or by spatial structuring of neutral host genetic diversity via founder effects, genetic drift, or isolation by distance. Alternatively, associations between microbes and host phylogeny may be generated by their spatial autocorrelation across landscapes, rather than the direct effects of host genetics. In this study, we collected MHC, microsatellite, and gut microbiome data from separate individuals belonging to the Galapagos mockingbird species complex, which consists of four allopatrically distributed species. We applied multiple regression with distance matrices and Bayesian inference to test for correlations between average genetic and microbiome similarity across nine islands for which all three levels of data were available. Clustering of individuals by species was strongest when measured with microsatellite markers and weakest for gut microbiome distributions, with intermediate clustering of MHC allele frequencies. We found that while correlations between island-averaged gut microbiome composition and both microsatellite and MHC dissimilarity existed across species, these relationships were greatly weakened when accounting for geographic distance. Overall, our study finds little support for large-scale control of gut microbiome composition by neutral or adaptive genetic regions across closely related bird phylogenies, although this does not preclude the possibility that host genetics shapes gut microbiome at the individual level.","[Fleischer, Ramona; Risely, Alice; Sommer, Simone] Univ Ulm, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Ulm, Germany; [Hoeck, Paquita E.

Currently, gastrointestinal diseases due to dysregulated gut microbiota are considered important factors that limit growth of the captive forest musk deer population. Compared with captive forest musk deer, wild forest musk deer have a wider feeding range with no dietary limitations, and their gut microbiota are in a relatively natural state. However, no reports have compared the gut microbiota between wild and captive forest musk deer. To gain insight into the composition of gut microbiota in forest musk deer under different food-source conditions, we employed high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing technology to investigate differences in the gut microbiota occurring between captive and wild forest musk deer. Both captive and wild forest musk deer showed similar microbiota at the phylum level, which consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, although significant differences were found in their relative abundances between both groups. alpha-Diversity results showed that no significant differences occurred in the microbiota between both groups, while beta-diversity results showed that significant differences did occur in their microbiota compositions.

Gut microbiota plays a key role in the survival and reproduction of wild animals which rely on microbiota to break down plant compounds for nutrients. As compared to laboratory animals, wild animals face much more threat of environmental changes (e.g. food shortages and risk of infection). Therefore, studying the gut microbiota of wild animals can help us better understand the mechanisms animals use to adapt to their environment. Methods. We collected the feces of Brandt's voles in the grassland, of three age groups (juvenile, adult and old), in both sexes. We studied the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing. Results. The main members of gut microbiota in Brandt's voles were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. As voles get older, the proportion of Firmicutes increased gradually, and the proportion of Bacteroides decreased gradually. The diversity of the microbiota of juveniles is lower, seems like there is still a lot of space for colonization, and there are large variations in the composition of the microbiome between individuals. In adulthood, the gut microbiota tends to be stable, and the diversity is highest. In adult, the abundances of Christensenellaceae and Peptococcus of female were significantly higher than male voles. Conclusions. The gut microbiota of Brandt's vole was influenced by sex and age, probably due to growth needs and hormone levels. Gut microbiota of wild animals were much influenced by their life-history reflected by their age and sex. Future studies will be directed to identify functions of these wild microbiota'' in regulating physiological or behavioral processes of wild animals in different life stage or sexes.","[Xu, Xiaoming; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiaoming; Zhang, Zhibin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Biot Interact, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Biot Interact, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,,Key projects of International Cooperation Bureau of Chinese Academy of Sciences [152111KYSB20160089]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31700344],"This study was supported by the Key projects of International Cooperation Bureau of Chinese Academy of Sciences (152111KYSB20160089) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31700344).

The giant panda is a flagship species for the conservation of wildlife. With integrated efforts including captive breeding, this species has been recently upgraded from endangered to vulnerable (IUCN 2016). Since a large proportion (21.8%) of their global population is still captive, it is critical to understand how captivity changes the gut microbiome of these pandas and how such alterations to the microbiome might affect their future fitness and potential impact on the ecosystem after release into the wild. Here, we use 16S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) marker gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics sequencing to demonstrate that the fecal microbiomes differ substantially between wild and captive giant pandas. Fecal microbiome diversity was significantly lower in captive pandas, as was the diversity of functional genes. Additionally, captive pandas have reduced functional potential for cellulose degradation but enriched metabolic pathways for starch metabolism, indicating that they may not adapt to a wild diet after being released into the wild since a major component of their diet in the wild will be bamboo. Most significantly, we observed a significantly higher level of amylase activity but a lower level of cellulase activity in captive giant panda feces than those of wild giant pandas, shown by an in vitro experimental assay. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors, as well as heavy metal tolerance genes were enriched in the microbiomes of captive pandas, which raises a great concern of spreading these genes to other wild animals and ecosystems when they are released into a wild environment. Our results clearly show that captivity has altered the giant panda microbiome, which could have unintended negative consequences on their adaptability and the ecosystem during the reintroduction of giant pandas into the wild.","[Guo, Wei; Mishra, Sudhanshu; Ning, Ruihong; Kong, Fanli; Zeng, Bo; Li, Ying] Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat Key, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Guo, Wei] Chengdu Med Coll, Sch Lab Med, Sichuan Prov EngineeringLab Prevent & Control Tec, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chengdong; Zhang, Hemin] China Conservat & Res Ctr Giant Panda, Yaan 611830, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jiangchao] Univ Arkansas, Dept Anim Sci, Div Agr, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Li, Y (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat Key, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Zhao, JC (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Anim Sci, Div Agr, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",guochina2005@126.com; mishra.sudhanshu30@gmail.com; wang_2019pandas@sina.com; zhang_2019pandas@sina.com; about2006@163.com; kfl229@163.com; apollobovey@163.com; jzhao77@uark.edu; yingli@sicau.edu.cn,"MISHRA, SUDHANSHU/E-6732-2011","Zeng, Bo/0000-0001-7482-7340; MISHRA, SUDHANSHU/0000-0003-3789-7571",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31471997]; Financial Allocation Fund Project of the State Forestry Administration in China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31900307) to W.G., and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31471997) to Y.L., and the Financial Allocation Fund Project of the State Forestry Administration in China to C.W.",,73,19,20,3,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4425,,GENES-BASEL,Genes,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,827,10.3390/genes10100827,,,17,Genetics & Heredity,Genetics & Heredity,JP6UA,WOS:000498397100098,31635158,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-10-25,

The Save the Tasmanian Devil Program has established an insurance population, which currently holds over 600 devils in captive facilities across Australia. Microbes are known to play a crucial role in the health and well-being of humans and other animals, and increasing evidence suggests that changes in the microbiota can influence various aspects of host physiology and development. To improve our understanding of devils and facilitate management and conservation of the species, we characterised the microbiome of wild devils and investigated differences in the composition of microbial community between captive and wild individuals. Results: A total of 1,223,550 bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were generated via Roche 454 sequencing from 56 samples, including 17 gut, 15 skin, 18 pouch and 6 oral samples. The devil's gut microbiome was dominated by Firmicutes and showed a high Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, which appears to be a common feature of many carnivorous mammals. Metabolisms of carbohydrates, amino acids, energy, cofactors and vitamins, nucleotides and lipids were predicted as the most prominent metabolic pathways that the devil's gut flora contributed to. The microbiota inside the female's pouch outside lactation was highly similar to that of the skin, both co-dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The oral microbiome had similar proportions of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Fusobacteria. Conclusions: Compositional differences were observed in all four types of microbiota between devils from captive and wild populations. Certain captive devils had significantly lower levels of gut bacterial diversity than wild individuals, and the two groups differed in the proportion of gut bacteria accounting for the metabolism of glycan, amino acids and cofactors and vitamins. Further studies are underway to investigate whether alterations in the microbiome of captive devils can have impacts on their ability to adapt and survive following re-introduction to the wild.","[Cheng, Yuanyuan; Belov, Katherine] Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, RMC Gunn Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Fox, Samantha; Pemberton, David] Dept Primary Ind Pk Water & Environm, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Hogg, Carolyn] Zoo & Aquarium Assoc, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia; [Papenfuss, Anthony T.] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Bioinformat Div, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Papenfuss, Anthony T.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Belov, K (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Vet Sci, RMC Gunn Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",kathy.belov@sydney.edu.au,"Cheng, Yuanyuan/M-6476-2017; Papenfuss, Anthony T/C-6297-2008","Cheng, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-1747-9308; Papenfuss, Anthony T/0000-0002-1102-8506; Belov, Katherine/0000-0002-9762-5554; Hogg, Carolyn/0000-0002-6328-398X",Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council; ARC Future FellowshipAustralian Research Council; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) ProgramNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1054618]; Victorian State Government Operational Infrastructure Support; Australian Government NHMRC Independent Research Institute Infrastructure Support SchemeAustralian GovernmentNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Save the Tasmanian Devil Program,This work was funded by an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery grant to KB and ATP.

Therefore, understanding the gut microbiota composition and function of wild asses can provide a theoretical for the situ conservation of wild animals in the future.In this study, we measured the dry matter digestion by the 4 molar hydrochloric acid (4N HCL) acid-insoluble ash method and analyzed the intestinal microbiota of wild asses and domestic donkeys by high-throughput sequencing of the 16s rDNA genes in V3-V4 regions. The results showed that the dry matter digestion in wild asses was significantly higher than in domestic donkeys (P < 0.05). No significant difference in alpha diversity was detected between these two groups. Beta diversity showed that the bacterial community structure of wild asses was acutely different from domestic donkeys. At the phylum level, the two dominant phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in wild asses were significantly higher than that in domestic donkeys. At the genus level, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214, Phascolarctobacterium, Coprostanoligenes_group, Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group and Akkermansia in wild asses were significantly higher than in domestic donkeys. Moreover, statistical comparisons showed that 40 different metabolic pathways exhibited significant differences. Among them, 29 pathways had richer concentrations in wild asses than domestic donkeys, mainly included amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism. Of note, network analysis showed that wild asses harbored a relatively more complex bacterial network than domestic donkeys, possibly reflecting the specific niche adaption of gut bacterial communities through species interactions. The overall results indicated that wild asses have advantages over domestic donkeys in dry matter digestion, gut microbial community composition and function, and wild asses have their unique intestinal flora to adapt high altitudes on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.","[Liu, Hongjin; Zhao, Xinquan; Han, Xueping; Xu, Shixiao; Zhao, Liang; Hu, Linyong; Xu, Tianwei; Zhao, Na; Zhang, Xiaoling; Chen, Dongdong; He, Fuquan; Chen, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongjin; Zhao, Xinquan; Han, Xueping; Xu, Shixiao; Zhao, Liang; Hu, Linyong; Xu, Tianwei; Zhao, Na; Zhang, Xiaoling; Chen, Dongdong; He, Fuquan; Chen, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongjin; Han, Xueping; Zhang, Xiaoling; Chen, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Xu, SX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China.; Xu, SX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",sxxu@nwipb.cas.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFD0502301]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31402120]; Key R&D and transformation plan of Qinghai Province [2019-SF-153]; The Dawn of West China 2018 Talent Training Program of CAS,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFD0502301), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31402120), the Key R&D and transformation plan of Qinghai Province (No. 2019-SF-153), and The Dawn of West China 2018 Talent Training Program of CAS by Dongdong Chen.

Therefore, efforts have been made to understand how wildlife can rebound from anthropogenic disturbances. An essential mechanism to adapt to environmental and social changes is the fluctuations in the host gut microbiome. Here we give a comprehensive description of anthropogenically induced microbiome alterations in Asian elephants (n=30). We detected gut microbial changes due to overseas translocation, captivity and deworming. We found that microbes belonging to Planococcaceae had the highest contribution in the microbiome alterations after translocation, while Clostridiaceae, Spirochaetaceae and Bacteroidia were the most affected after captivity. However, deworming significantly changed the abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Weeksellaceae and Burkholderiaceae. These findings may provide fundamental ideas to help guide the preservation tactics and probiotic replacement therapies of a dysbiosed gut microbiome in Asian elephants.

It lives on a bamboo-dominated diet at present, but it still retains a typical carnivorous digestive system and is genetically deficient in cellulose-digesting enzymes. To find out whether this endangered mammalian species, like other herbivores, has successfully developed a gut microbiota adapted to its fiber-rich diet, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene-based large-scale structural profiling of the giant panda fecal microbiota. Forty-five captive individuals were sampled in spring, summer, and late autumn within 1 year. Significant intraindividual variations in the diversity and structure of gut microbiota across seasons were observed in this population, which were even greater than the variations between individuals. Compared with published data sets involving 124 gut microbiota profiles from 54 mammalian species, these giant pandas, together with 9 captive and 7 wild individuals investigated previously, showed extremely low gut microbiota diversity and an overall structure that diverged from those of nonpanda herbivores but converged with those of carnivorous and omnivorous bears. The giant panda did not harbor putative cellulose-degrading phylotypes such as Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroides bacteria that are typically enriched in other herbivores, but instead, its microbiota was dominated by Escherichia/Shigella and Streptococcus bacteria. Members of the class Clostridia were common and abundant in the giant panda gut microbiota, but most of the members present were absent in other herbivores and were not phylogenetically related with known cellulolytic lineages. Therefore, the giant panda appears not to have evolved a gut microbiota compatible with its newly adopted diet, which may adversely influence the coevolutionary fitness of this herbivore. IMPORTANCE The giant panda, an endangered mammalian species endemic to western China, is well known for its unique bamboo diet. Unlike other herbivores that have successfully evolved anatomically specialized digestive systems to efficiently deconstruct fibrous plant matter, the giant panda still retains a gastrointestinal tract typical of carnivores. We characterized the fecal bacterial communities from a giant panda population to determine whether this animal relies on its symbiotic gut microbiota to cope with the complex carbohydrates that dominate its diet, as is common in other herbivores. We found that the giant panda gut microbiota is low in diversity and highly variable across seasons. It also shows an overall composition typical of bears and entirely differentiated from other herbivores, with low levels of putative cellulose-digesting bacteria. The gut microbiota of this herbivore, therefore, may not have well adapted to its highly fibrous diet, suggesting a potential link with its poor digestive efficiency.","[Xue, Zhengsheng; Wang, Linghua; Zhang, Menghui; Zhang, Xiaojun; Bridgewater, Laura C.; Zhao, Liping; Pang, Xiaoyan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenping; Hou, Rong; Fei, Lisong; Huang, He; Zhang, Zhihe] Chengdu Res Base Giant Panda Breeding, Sichuan Key Lab Conservat Biol Endangered Wildlif, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yi; Jiang, Chenglin] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Inst Microbiol, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Liping] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Minist Educ Key Lab Syst Biomed, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China","Pang, XY (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",xypang@sjtu.edu.cn; zzh@panda.org.cn,"Zhang, Wenping/H-5125-2015; Bridgewater, Laura C/I-2999-2015; zhang, menghui/Q-3752-2016; Puigbo, Pere/A-2214-2008; Zhang, Xiaojun/AAH-2256-2019","Bridgewater, Laura C/0000-0002-4664-6144; Zhang, Xiaojun/0000-0002-4559-0177","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31121064]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31330005, 30730005]; Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Foundation [CPF08002]; Bureau of Science and Technology of Chengdu City [11GGYB341SF-027]; National Key Technology RD ProgramNational Key Technology R&D Program [2012BAC01B06]; Chengdu Urban and Rural Construction Commission","This study was supported by Project 31121064 of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and Key Project 31330005 and 30730005 of the NSFC, Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Foundation (CPF08002), the Bureau of Science and Technology of Chengdu City (11GGYB341SF-027), the National Key Technology R&D Program (2012BAC01B06), and the Chengdu Urban and Rural Construction Commission.",,70,121,128,5,137,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",2150-7511,,,MBIO,mBio,MAY-JUN,2015,6,3,,,,,,,e00022-15,10.1128/mBio.00022-15,,,12,Microbiology,Microbiology,CM7JH,WOS:000357867400001,25991678,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-10-25,

The gut microbial characteristics were examined in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) from eastern China (Huangshan, Anhui), but little is known about other geographical populations. Herein, we collected 40 fecal samples of Tibetan macaques from the Labahe Natural Reserve in western China over four seasons and analyzed the seasonal variation of gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 sequencing. The analysis showed that gut microbial diversity and composition varied by season. Autumn exhibited the lowest alpha diversity and remarkably separated from the other three seasons for beta diversity. There were statistically significant differences in the composition of gut microbiota during different seasons. Autumn presented the lowest Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio while winter had the highest. The family Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae within Firmicutes accounted for a high proportion in each season, but the abundance of Lactobacillaceae was significantly lower in winter. During autumn, Preotella, which can utilize carbohydrates increased significantly. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) prediction revealed that metabolism of cofactors of vitamin pathways and glycan biosynthesis pathways were highly enriched in autumn. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota potentially play an important role in the adaptation of wild Tibetan macaques to the seasonal fluctuations of food availability, which may contribute to the conservation of this endangered species.

Wildlife gut microbiomes play a vital role in host health. Changes to wildlife gut microbiomes due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation, can disrupt natural gut microbiota homeostasis and make animals vulnerable to infections that may become zoonotic. However, it remains unclear whether the disruption to wildlife gut microbiomes is caused by habitat fragmentation per se or the combination of habitat fragmentation with additional anthropogenic disturbances, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and their pathogens. Here, we show that habitat fragmentation per se does not impact the gut microbiome of a generalist rodent species native to Central America, Tome's spiny rat Proechimys semispinosus, but additional anthropogenic disturbances do. Indeed, compared to protected continuous and fragmented forest landscapes that are largely untouched by other human activities, the gut microbiomes of spiny rats inhabiting human-disturbed fragmented landscapes revealed a reduced alpha diversity and a shifted and more dispersed beta diversity. Their microbiomes contained more taxa associated with domesticated animals and their potential pathogens, suggesting a shift in potential metagenome functions. On the one hand, the compositional shift could indicate a degree of gut microbial adaption known as metagenomic plasticity. On the other hand, the greater variation in community structure and reduced alpha diversity may signal a decline in beneficial microbial functions and illustrate that gut adaption may not catch up with anthropogenic disturbances, even in a generalist species with large phenotypic plasticity, with potentially harmful consequences to both wildlife and human health. Fackelmann et al. study the gut microbial composition of spiny rats across tropical forests in Panama with varying levels of protection and fragmentation in order to disentangle the relative influences of habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance on wildlife gut microbiomes. They find that habitat fragmentation on its own did not affect the gut microbiome, but the microbiomes of individuals inhabiting forest fragments affected by anthropogenic disturbance displayed a shift in community composition and structure, and were more likely to have microbiota associated with domesticated animals and their pathogens.","[Fackelmann, Gloria; Gillingham, Mark A.

Distinct differences in the fecal metabolic phenotypes of captive and wild North China leopard were found, such as content of l-methionine, n-acetyl-l-tyrosine, pentadecanoic acid and oleic acid. Differentially abundant gut microbes were associated with fecal metabolites, especially the bacteria in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, involved in the metabolism of N-acetyl-L-alanine and D-quinovose.ConclusionThis study reports for the first time the differences in gut microbiota abundance between captive and wild North China leopard, as well as significant differences in fecal metabolic phenotypes between two groups.","[Hua, Yan; Cao, Heqin; Jiang, Guangshun] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Nat Protected Area, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Hua, Yan; Wang, Jiao] Guangdong Acad Forestry, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Silviculture Protect & Uti, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China; [He, Fengping] Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Jiang, GS (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Nat Protected Area, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",jgshun@126.com,,"Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC 31872241]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017PZ14]; National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; Biodiversity Survey, Monitoring and Assessment Project of Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China [2019HB2096001006]","This research is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 31872241), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572017PZ14), National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0503200), and Biodiversity Survey, Monitoring and Assessment Project of Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China (2019HB2096001006).The funders supported the charge of field studies, 16S rRNA sequencing, and metabolitics analysis.",,51,1,1,7,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1746-6148,,BMC VET RES,BMC Vet.

Our group has recently revealed that the occurrence of diverse combinations of gut microbial compositions and functions (metagenomics) in Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) populations is likely to lead to increased evolutionary potential and resilience in response to environmental changes. Thus, considering the effects of diet on the gut microbiome and the importance of a stable gut microbial community to host health, we suggest that a transitional buffer period (with feeding on a regular diet and a diet from the translocation habitat) is needed before animal translocation. When the gut microbiome enters into relatively stable stages and adapts to the new diet from the translocation site, the time is suitable for translocation. Long-term monitoring of the gut microbiomes of translocated animals (by collecting fresh feces and carrying out next-generation sequencing) is still necessary after their translocation.","[Yao, Ran; Xu, Lianglaing; Zhu, Lifeng] Nanjing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Guoqing] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE USA","Zhu, LF (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhulf@ioz.ac.cn,"Zhu, Lifeng/AAK-8892-2020",,"National Natural Science FundNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31222009, 31570489]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Fund (31222009, 31570489) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,15,2,2,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1176-9343,,,EVOL BIOINFORM,Evol.

Conventional techniques of fecal microbiome analysis have been developed within the broad contexts defined by human biology; hence, many of these techniques are not immediately applicable to wild nonhuman primates. In order to establish a standard experimental protocol for the analysis of the gut microbiomes of wild animals, we selected the Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui) on Yakushima Island. We tested different protocols for each stage of fecal sample processing: storage, DNA extraction, and choice of the sequencing region in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We also analyzed the gut microbiome of captive Japanese macaques as the control. The comparison of samples obtained from identical macaques but subjected to different protocols showed that the tested storage methods (RNAlater and lysis buffer) produced effectively the same composition of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as the standard frozen storage method, although the relative abundance of each OTU was quantitatively affected. Taxonomic assignment of the detected bacterial groups was also significantly affected by the region being sequenced, indicating that sequencing regions and the corresponding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer pairs for the 16S rRNA gene should be carefully selected. This study improves the current standard methods for microbiome analysis in wild nonhuman primates.

We studied the effects of two feeding systems on the rumen and hindgut microbiome of semi-feral Tibetan goats kept at high altitude (similar to 4800 m) using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. Intensive drylot feeding resulted in significantly higher zootechnical performance, narrower ruminal acetate: propionate ratios and a drop in the average rumen pH at slaughter to similar to 5.04. Hindgut microbial adaption appeared to be more diverse in the drylot group suggesting a higher influx of undegraded complex non-starch polysaccharides from the rumen. Despite their higher fiber levels in the diet, grazing goats exhibited lower counts of Methanobrevibacter and genes associated with the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway, presumably reflecting the scarce dietary conditions (low energy density) when rearing goats on pasture from extreme alpine environments. These conditions appeared to promote a relevant abundance of bacitracin genes. In parallel, we recognized a significant increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the digestive tracts of drylot animals. In summary, this study provides a deeper insight into the metataxonomic and functional adaption of the gastrointestinal microbiome of goats subject to intensive drylot and extensive pasture rearing conditions at high altitude.","[Zhang, Ke; Xu, Yangbin; Zhang, Chenguang; Li, Chao; Yang, Yuxin; Kalds, Peter; Wang, Xiaolong; Chen, Yulin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Key Lab Anim Genet Breeding & Reprod Shaanxi Prov, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Chong; Jing, Xu; Wang, Meili] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Suo, Langda; Wu, Yujiang] Tibet Acad Agr & Anim Husb Sci, Inst Anim Sci, Lhasa 850009, Peoples R China; [Song, Jiuzhou] Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Brugger, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Vet Fac, Inst Anim Nutr, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Chen, YL (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Xinong Rd 22, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",chenyulin@nwafu.edu.cn,"Brugger, Daniel/E-6905-2018","Brugger, Daniel/0000-0001-7267-0335; Zhang, Ke/0000-0002-2392-1545","Tibet Science and Technology Department's '13th Five-Year Plan' Major Agriculture Project [XZ201901NA02, 2017NY-072, 2018KJXX-009]; China Agriculture Research System [CARS-3-12]; Key Research and Development Programof Shaanxi [2019ZDLNY07-02-01]","The present study was supported by the Tibet Science and Technology Department's '13th Five-Year Plan' Major Agriculture Project (XZ201901NA02), the Local Grants (2017NY-072 and 2018KJXX-009), as well as by China Agriculture Research System (CARS-3-12), Key Research and Development Programof Shaanxi (Number 2019ZDLNY07-02-01).

The impact of domestication on animal physiology and behavior has been extensively studied, whereas its effect on the gut microbiota is still largely unexplored. For this reason, 16S rRNA gene-based and internal transcribed spacer-mediated bifidobacterial profiling, together with shotgun metagenomics, was employed to investigate the taxonomic composition and metabolic repertoire of 146 mammalian fecal samples, corresponding to 12 domesticated-feral dyads. Our results revealed that changes induced by domestication have extensively shaped the taxonomic composition of the mammalian gut microbiota. In this context, the selection of microbial taxa linked to a more efficient feed conversion into body mass and putative horizontal transmission of certain bacterial genera from humans were observed in the fecal microbiota of domesticated animals when compared to their feral relatives and to humans. In addition, profiling of the metabolic arsenal through metagenomics highlighted extensive functional adaptation of the fecal microbial community of domesticated mammals to changes induced by domestication. Remarkably, domesticated animals showed, when compared to their feral relatives, increased abundance of specific glycosyl hydrolases, possibly due to the higher intake of complex plant carbohydrates typical of commercial animal feeds.","[Alessandri, Giulia; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina] Univ Parma, Dept Vet Sci, Via Taglio 8, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Milani, Christian; Mancabelli, Leonardo; Mangifesta, Marta; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea; Duranti, Sabrina; Turroni, Francesca; Ventura, Marco] Univ Parma, Dept Chem Life Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Lab Probiogen, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Viappiani, Alice] GenProbio Srl, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Turroni, Francesca; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina; Ventura, Marco] Univ Parma, Microbiome Res Hub, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [van Sinderen, Douwe] Natl Univ Ireland, APC Microbiome Inst, Western Rd, Cork, Ireland; [van Sinderen, Douwe] Natl Univ Ireland, Sch Microbiol, Biosci Inst, Western Rd, Cork, Ireland","Ventura, M (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Chem Life Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Lab Probiogen, Parco Area Sci 11a, I-43124 Parma, Italy.",marco.ventura@unipr.it,"Milani, Christian/ABA-8160-2020; Turroni, Francesca/K-9660-2016; Mancabelli, Leonardo/AAV-5147-2021; mangifesta, marta/AAW-1521-2020; ventura, marco/M-8230-2015; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea/AAV-5150-2021; Van Sinderen, Douwe/A-6778-2015; Duranti, Sabrina/AAI-7916-2020; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina/A-6344-2016","Turroni, Francesca/0000-0001-5363-0231; Mancabelli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1744-2214; mangifesta, marta/0000-0002-0933-1071; Lugli, Gabriele Andrea/0000-0002-3024-0537; Van Sinderen, Douwe/0000-0003-1823-7957; Duranti, Sabrina/0000-0002-7724-5669; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina/0000-0003-2642-3709","EU Joint Programming Initiative-A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life (JPI HDHL); Science Foundation Ireland [SFI]Science Foundation Ireland [15/JP-HDHL/3280]; MIUR, ItalyMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); Fondazione Cariparma, under TeachInParma Project; Fondazione Cariparma, Parma, Italy; Laboratory of Probiogenomics","This work was primarily funded by the EU Joint Programming Initiative-A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life (JPI HDHL, http://www.healthydietforhealthylife.eu/) to DvS (in conjunction with Science Foundation Ireland [SFI] grant number 15/JP-HDHL/3280) and toMV (in conjunction with MIUR, Italy).

All jawed vertebrates share mucosal immunity dedicated to isolating the microbiota, and a breakdown of this system can result in chronic gut inflammation. In humans, chronic gut inflammation negatively affects growth and development. There is little information available on the prevalence of chronic gut inflammation in wild animals, but given that animals with different life histories emphasize different immune responses, it follows that wild animals may vary in their susceptibility to chronic gut inflammation, and most animals will experience signaling that can lead to this state. These can be top-down signals originating from sources like the central nervous system or bottom-up signals originating from changes in the gut microbiota. The sources of these signals might include stress, developmental transitions, food restriction, and dietary shifts. Here, we briefly discuss host-microbiota interactions from the perspective of life history theory and ecoimmunology, focusing on the mucosal immune system and chronic gut inflammation. We also include future directions for research and the tools necessary to investigate them.","[Kirschman, Lucas J.; Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn C.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA","Kirschman, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",ljkirschman@alaska.edu,,"Kirschman, Lucas/0000-0002-2625-3124",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R15GM122038] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R15 GM122038] Funding Source: Medline,,,182,1,1,3,16,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

The mechanisms regulating the adaptive SIgA response towards gut microbes are poorly defined. Deletion of P2rx7, encoding for the ATP-gated ionotropic P2X7 receptor, leads to T follicular helper (Tfh) cells expansion in the Peyer's patches (PPs) of the small intestine, enhanced germinal centre (GC) reaction and IgA secretion; the resulting alterations of the gut microbiota in turn affects host metabolism. Here, we define gut microbiota modifications that correlate with deregulated SIgA secretion and metabolic alterations in P2rx7(-/-) mice. In particular, Lactobacillus shows enhanced SIgA coating in P2rx7(-/-) with respect to wild-type (WT) mice. The abundance of SIgA-coated lactobacilli positively correlates with Tfh cells number and body weight, suggesting Lactobacillus-specific SIgA response conditions host metabolism. Accordingly, oral administration of intestinal Lactobacillus isolates from P2rx7(-/-) mice to WT animals results in altered glucose homeostasis and fat deposition. Thus, enhanced SIgA production by P2X7 insufficiency promotes Lactobacillus colonization that interferes with systemic metabolic homeostasis. These data indicate that P2X7 receptor-mediated regulation of commensals coating by SIgA is important in tuning the selection of bacterial taxa, which condition host metabolism.","[Perruzza, Lisa; Strati, Francesco; Grassi, Fabio] USI, Fac Biomed Sci, Inst Res Biomed, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Gargari, Giorgio; Guglielmetti, Simone] Univ Milan, Dept Food Environm & Nutr Sci DeFENS, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [D'Erchia, Anna Maria; Fosso, Bruno; Pesole, Graziano] CNR, Inst Biomembranes & Bioenerget, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Pesole, Graziano] Univ Bari, Dept Biosci Biotechnol & Biopharmaceut, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Grassi, Fabio] Univ Milan, Dept Med Biotechnol & Translat Med, I-20129 Milan, Italy; [Grassi, Fabio] Ist Nazl Genet Mol Romeo & Enrica Invernizzi, I-20122 Milan, Italy","Grassi, F (corresponding author), USI, Fac Biomed Sci, Inst Res Biomed, CH-6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.; Grassi, F (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Med Biotechnol & Translat Med, I-20129 Milan, Italy.; Grassi, F (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Genet Mol Romeo & Enrica Invernizzi, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",fabio.grassi@irb.usi.ch,"Fosso, Bruno/P-1538-2018; Guglielmetti, Simone/K-2507-2018; D'Erchia, Anna maria/K-9001-2016; Strati, Francesco/K-7789-2016","Fosso, Bruno/0000-0003-2324-086X; Guglielmetti, Simone/0000-0002-8673-8190; Strati, Francesco/0000-0001-7217-3355; GRASSI, FABIO/0000-0003-3348-1712; Gargari, Giorgio/0000-0001-9077-6328; D'ERCHIA, Anna Maria/0000-0002-4627-0626","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [310030_159491, IZCNZ0-174704]; Novartis Stiftung fur medizinisch-biologische Forschung [18B096]","We would like to thank David Jarrossay (Institute for Research in Biomedicine) for cell sorting and Teresa De Filippis, Claudia Lionetti (University of Bari), and Caterina Manzari (Institute of Biomembranes and Bioenergetics) for contributing to 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Global temperature regimes are expected to undergo rapid shifts in the next century, yet for many animal taxa we lack an understanding of the consequences of these predicted shifts for animal populations. In this review, we synthesize recent evidence that temperature variation shapes the composition and function of animal gut microbiomes, key regulators of host physiology, with potential consequences for host population responses to climate change. Several recent studies spanning a range of animal taxa, including Chordata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca, have reported repeatable associations between temperature and the community composition and function of the gut microbiome. In several cases, the same microbiome responses to temperature have been observed across distantly related animal taxa, suggesting the existence of conserved mechanisms underlying temperature-induced microbiome plasticity. Extreme temperatures can disrupt the stability of alpha-diversity within the gut microbiomes individual hosts and generate beta-diversity among microbiomes within host populations. Microbiome states resulting from extreme temperatures have been associated, and in some cases causally linked, with both beneficial and deleterious effects on host phenotypes. We propose routes by which temperature-induced changes in the gut microbiome may impact host fitness, including effects on colonization resistance in the gut, on host energy and nutrient assimilation, and on host life history traits. Cumulatively, available data indicate that disruption of the gut microbiome may be a mechanism by which changing temperatures will impact animal fitness in wild-living populations.","[Sepulveda, Juan; Moeller, Andrew H.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Moeller, AH (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",andrew.moeller@cornell.edu,,,,,,56,24,24,4,23,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Yet, little is known about such variability among fish, in spite of their importance in aquatic ecosystems. The Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is an intriguing candidate to test microbiome-related hypotheses on the drivers and consequences of animal adaptation, given the recent parallel origins of a similar ecotype across streams. To assess the relationships between the microbiome and host adaptation, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize gut bacteria of two guppy ecotypes with known divergence in diet, life history, physiology and morphology collected from low-predation (LP) and high-predation (HP) habitats in four Trinidadian streams. Guts were populated by several recurring, core bacteria that are related to other fish associates and rarely detected in the environment. Although gut communities of lab-reared guppies differed from those in the wild, microbiome divergence between ecotypes from the same stream was evident under identical rearing conditions, suggesting host genetic divergence can affect associations with gut bacteria. In the field, gut communities varied over time, across streams and between ecotypes in a stream-specific manner. This latter finding, along with PICRUSt predictions of metagenome function, argues against strong parallelism of the gut microbiome in association with LP ecotype evolution. Thus, bacteria cannot be invoked in facilitating the heightened reliance of LP guppies on lower-quality diets.

To address this gap, we first characterized the faecal bacteria of mice with a functioning immune system (wild-type, WT), mice with defective immune responses (CD45), mice lacking an adaptive immune system (RAG), and mice with both immune dysfunctions (45RAG). Using fingerprinting of 16S rRNA genes, we observed significant differences in gut microbiota composition across all mouse strains (P<0.001) and identified several mouse strain-specific genera via pyrosequencing, including Turicibacter sp. (in WT mice) and Allobaculum sp. (in CD45-deficient animals). To define the role of the host immune system in constraining gut microbiota stability after perturbation, we cohoused CD45-deficient and WT mice and monitored gut bacterial community dynamics during 8 weeks. Cohousing caused the WT bacterial communities to become indistinguishable from those of CD45 mice (0.05). Time-series analysis indicated that the communities of cohoused mice changed directionally as opposed to the relatively stable communities of non-cohoused controls. When we considered only taxonomic membership, it was the communities of CD45 non-cohoused mice that experienced the highest rate of change. Rather than be governed by fluctuations in the relative abundance of taxa, we suggest that CD45-regulated immune responses either are stimulated by the presence of bacteria per se or promote temporal stability by selecting for the occurrence of specific taxa.","[Dimitriu, Pedro A.; Boyce, Guilaine; Samarakoon, Asanga; Hartmann, Martin; Johnson, Pauline; Mohn, William W.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Life Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada","Mohn, WW (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Life Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",wmohn@mail.ubc.ca,"Johnson, Pauline/G-9659-2019; Hartmann, Martin/M-9371-2016","Johnson, Pauline/0000-0001-7367-4653; Hartmann, Martin/0000-0001-8069-5284",Tula Foundation; Evolution and Martha Piper Research Fund; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [77712]; Canadian Digestive Health Foundation,We thank David VanInsberghe for technical assistance.

The selective pressures imposed on insects by exposure to toxins may also be selective pressures on their symbiotic bacteria, who thus may contribute to the mechanism of toxin tolerance for the insect. Amatoxins are a class of cyclopeptide mushroom toxins that primarily act by binding to RNA polymerase II and inhibiting transcription. Several species of mycophagousDrosophilaare tolerant to amatoxins found in mushrooms of the genusAmanita, despite these toxins being lethal to most other known eukaryotes. These species can tolerate amatoxins in natural concentrations to utilize toxic mushrooms as larval hosts, but the mechanism by which these species are tolerant remains unknown. Previous data have shown that a local population ofD. tripunctataexhibits significant genetic variation in toxin tolerance. This study assesses the potential role of the microbiome in alpha-amanitin tolerance in six wild-derived strains ofDrosophila tripunctata. Normal and antibiotic-treated samples of six strains were reared on diets with and without alpha-amanitin, and then scored for survival from the larval stage to adulthood and for development time to pupation. Our results show that a substantial reduction in bacterial load does not influence toxin tolerance in this system, while confirming genotype and toxin-specific effects on survival are independent of the microbiome composition. Thus, we conclude that this adaptation to exploit toxic mushrooms as a host is likely intrinsic to the fly's genome and not a property of their microbiome.","[Griffin, Logan H.; Reed, Laura K.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Griffin, LH (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",lhgriffin@crimson.ua.edu,,"Reed, Laura/0000-0002-4381-494X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1737869],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1737869",,40,0,0,3,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here we test the corollary hypothesis that the adaptive immune system, directly or indirectly, influences the evolution of commensal species. We compare the evolution of Escherichia coli upon colonization of the gut of wild-type and Rag2(-/-) mice, which lack lymphocytes. We show that bacterial adaptation is slower in immune-compromised animals, a phenomenon explained by differences in the action of natural selection within each host. Emerging mutations exhibit strong beneficial effects in healthy hosts but substantial antagonistic pleiotropy in immune-deficient mice. This feature is due to changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, which differs according to the immune status of the host. Our results indicate that the adaptive immune system influences the tempo and predictability of E. coli adaptation to the mouse gut.","[Barroso-Batista, Joao; Demengeot, Jocelyne; Gordo, Isabel] Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal","Gordo, I (corresponding author), Inst Gulbenkian Ciencias, Rua Quinta Grande 6, P-2780156 Oeiras, Portugal.",igordo@igc.gulbenkian.pt,"Gordo, Isabel/D-6770-2013; demengeot, jocelyne/K-8072-2014","Gordo, Isabel/0000-0003-1622-5143; demengeot, jocelyne/0000-0002-4761-614X",European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [260421-ECOADAPT]; Portuguese Science Foundation FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/BIA-EVF/118075/2010]; FCT grant [RECI/IMI-IMU/0038/2012]; EUEuropean Commission; LAO/ITQB; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BD/80257/2011],"We thank A.

There is a risk that this isolation from real-life conditions may lead to poor translatability and misinterpretation of results. We and others have shown that feral mice as well as laboratory mice exposed to naturalistic environments harbor a more diverse gut microbiota and display an activated immunological phenotype compared to hygienic laboratory mice. We here describe a naturalistic indoors housing system for mice, representing a farmyard-type habitat typical for house mice. Large open pens were installed with soil and domestic animal feces, creating a highly diverse microbial environment and providing space and complexity allowing for natural behavior. Laboratory C57BL/6 mice were co-housed in this system together with wild-caught feral mice, included as a source of murine microbionts. We found that mice feralized in this manner displayed a gut microbiota structure similar to their feral cohabitants, such as higher relative content of Firmicutes and enrichment of Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the immunophenotype of feralized mice approached that of feral mice, with elevated levels of memory T-cells and late-stage NK cells compared to laboratory-housed control mice, indicating antigenic experience and immune training. The dietary elements presented in the mouse pens could only moderately explain changes in microbial colonization, and none of the immunological changes. In conclusion, this system enables various types of studies using genetically controlled mice on the background of adaptation to a high diversity microbial environment and a lifestyle natural for the species.","[Arnesen, Henriette; Knutsen, Linn Emilie; Hognestad, Bente Wabakken; Johansen, Grethe Marie; Storset, Anne Kristine; Boysen, Preben] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Oslo, Norway; [Arnesen, Henriette] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, As, Norway; [Bemark, Mats] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Biomed, Sahlgrenska Acad, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Bemark, Mats] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Transfus Med, Gothenburg, Region Vastra G, Sweden; [Pabst, Oliver] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Mol Med, Aachen, Germany","Boysen, P (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Oslo, Norway.",preben.boysen@nmbu.no,"Boysen, Preben/C-5238-2013; Bemark, Mats/B-2578-2019","Boysen, Preben/0000-0002-0084-1251; Bemark, Mats/0000-0001-7416-9819; Arnesen, Henriette/0000-0003-1173-4010","NMBU; Nansen Fund (Unifor, Norway)","This research was funded internally at NMBU and the collaborators, microbiota analyses was supported by a grant from The Nansen Fund (Unifor, Norway).",,72,2,2,1,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Such effort allows us to amend their conservation strategies and tactics accordingly so that they are able to appropriately adapt to the new environment and dietary selection. In this study we focus on the gut flora of two groups of an endangered species, Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), wild group (WG) which is compared with that of the individuals of the same species but kept in the captivities (CG), a control group. Such a project is aimed to work out whether the composition of the gut microbes has significantly been changed due to captive feedings. To do so, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize gut bacteria of the musk deer from the two groups. The results show that there is a significant difference in community structure of the bacteria: WG shows significant enrichment of Firmicutes and depletion of Bacteroidetes, while CG has a significant abundance of Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota. Metagenomics was used to analyze the differences in functional enzymes between the two groups. The related results indicate that genes in WG are mostly related to the enzymes digesting cellulose and generating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) for signaling pathways, but CG shows enrichment in methanogenesis, including the CO2/H-2 pathway and the methylotrophic pathway. Thus, this study indicates that the Firmicutes-rich gut microbiota in the WG enables individuals to maximize their energy intake from the cellulose, and has significant abundance of Euryarchaeota and methanogenesis pathways that allow them to reduce redundant energy consumption in methane metabolism, ensuring them to adapt to the wild environments.","[Sun, Yewen; Shi, Zhihui; Zhu, Feng; Chen, Rui; Zhang, Jun; Pan, Ruliang; Li, Baoguo; Guo, Songtao] Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Key Lab Anim Conservat, Xian, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yujiao; Liu, Zhensheng; Zhao, Chang; Gao, Hui; Teng, Liwei] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yujiao] Henan Univ Anim Husb & Econ, Coll Food & Biol Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhensheng] China State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Wildlife Conservat, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Lu, Taofeng] Guizhou Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Inst Lab Anim Sci, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ruliang] Univ Western Australia, Sch Human Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Teng, Liwei] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Harbin Vet Res Inst, Harbin, Peoples R China","Guo, ST (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Key Lab Anim Conservat, Xian, Peoples R China.; Teng, LW (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Harbin, Peoples R China.; Teng, LW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Harbin Vet Res Inst, Harbin, Peoples R China.",tenglw1975@163.com; songtaoguo@nwu.edu.cn,,", Zhensheng Liu/0000-0001-5457-1536","National Key Program of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; Strategic Priority Research Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31872247, 31372221]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2018JC-022]; Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China (Northwest University), Ministry of Education [ZSK2019006]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572014CA03, DL13EA01]","This work was supported by the National Key Program of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0503200); the Strategic Priority Research Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB31000000); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31872247 and 31372221); the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (2018JC-022); Opening Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China (Northwest University), Ministry of Education (ZSK2019006); and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572014CA03 and DL13EA01).",,89,4,4,4,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Correspondingly, monumental human and financial resources have been invested in biomedical research, with a mission to decode the mechanisms of ageing and how these contribute to age-related disease. Multiple hallmarks of ageing have been identified that are common across taxa, highlighting their fundamental importance. These include dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism and telomeres biology, epigenetic modifications, cell-matrix interactions, proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion, inflammageing and immuno-senescence. While our understanding of the molecular basis of ageing is improving, it remains a complex and multifactorial process that remains to be fully understood. A key aspect of the shortfall in our understanding of the ageing process lies in translating data from standard animal models to humans. Consequently, we suggest that a 'biomimetic' and comparative approach, integrating knowledge from species in the wild, as opposed to inbred genetically homogenous laboratory animals, can provide powerful insights into human ageing processes. Here we discuss some particularities and comparative patterns among several species from the animal kingdom, endowed with longevity or short lifespans and unique metabolic profiles that could be potentially exploited to the understanding of ageing and age-related diseases. Based upon lessons from nature, we also highlight several avenues for renewed focus in the pathophysiology of ageing and age-related disease (i.e. diet-microbiome-health axis, oxidative protein damage, adaptive homoeostasis and planetary health). We propose that a biomimetic alliance with collaborative research from different disciplines can improve our understanding of ageing and age-related diseases with long-term sustainable utility.","[Dai, Lu; Stenvinkel, Peter] Karolinska Inst, Div Renal Med, Dept Clin Sci Intervent & Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Schurgers, Leon] Maastricht Univ, Dept Biochem, Cardiovasc Res Sch Maastricht CARIM, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Schurgers, Leon] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Expt Med & Syst Biol, Aachen, Germany; [Shiels, Paul G.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Canc Sci, Wolfson Wohl Translat Res Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","Stenvinkel, P (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Div Renal Med, Dept Clin Sci Intervent & Technol, Stockholm, Sweden.",peter.stenvinkel@ki.se,"Schurgers, Leon/AAT-7100-2021","Schurgers, Leon/0000-0001-7867-6957; Shiels, Paul/0000-0002-7577-9843; Stenvinkel, Peter/0000-0002-8785-4820",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [722609]; Strategic Research Program in Diabetes at Karolinska Institutet (Swedish Research Council) [2009-1068]; Heart and Lung FoundationSwedish Heart-Lung Foundation; CIMED,This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie (www.intricare.eu) [grant number 722609]; Strategic Research Program in Diabetes at Karolinska Institutet (Swedish Research Council) [grant number 2009-1068]; the Heart and Lung Foundation (to P.S.); CIMED (to P.S.).,,190,0,0,1,1,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"5TH FLR, 90 HIGH HOLBORN, LONDON WC1V 6LJ, ENGLAND",0143-5221,1470-8736,,CLIN SCI,Clin.

Despite its ubiquity, our understanding of this invisible but often critical relationship is still in its infancy. We employed adult Neotropical butterflies as a study system to ask three questions: First, how does gut microbial community composition vary across host individuals, species and dietary guilds? Second, how do gut microbiota compare to food microbial communities? Finally, are gut flora functionally adapted to the chemical makeup of host foods? To answer these questions we captured nearly 300 Costa Rican butterflies representing over 50 species, six families, and two feeding guilds: frugivores and nectivores. We characterized bacteria and fungi in guts, wild fruits, and wild nectars via amplicon sequencing and assessed the catabolic abilities of the gut microbiota via culture-based assays. Gut communities were distinct from food communities, suggesting that the gut environment acts as a filter on potential colonists. Nevertheless, gut flora varied widely among individuals and species. On average, a pair of butterflies shared 21% of their bacterial species and 6% of their fungi. Host species explained 25-30% of variation in microbial communities while host diet explained 4%, suggesting that non-dietary aspects of host biology play a large role in structuring the butterfly gut flora. Much of the variation between species correlated with host phylogeny. Host diet was related to gut microbial function: compared to frugivores, nectivores' gut flora exhibited increased catabolism of sugars and sugar alcohols and decreased catabolism of amino acids, carboxylic acids, and dicarboxylic acids. Since fermented juice contains more amino acids and less sugar than nectar, it appears that host diet filters the gut flora by favoring microbes that digest compounds abundant in foods. By quantifying the degree to which gut communities vary among host individuals, species and dietary guilds and evaluating how gut microbial composition and catabolic potential are related to host diet, this study highlights the linkages between structure and function in one of the most complex and ubiquitous symbioses in the animal kingdom.","[Ravenscraft, Alison; Berry, Michelle; Peay, Kabir] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hammer, Tobin] Univ Colorado, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Boggs, Carol] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Ravenscraft, Alison] Univ Arizona, Ctr Insect Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Hammer, Tobin] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Ravenscraft, A (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Ravenscraft, A (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Ctr Insect Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",aravenscraft@gmail.com,"Ravenscraft, Alison/U-5500-2019","Ravenscraft, Alison/0000-0003-4974-4804","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Stanford Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics; NIH PERT postdoctoral fellowshipUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; Stanford UniversityStanford University; Stanford University's Biology Department; Stanford University's Center for Latin American Studies; Stanford University's Biosciences Office of Graduate Education","A.

Deficiencies in any one of the these pathways can lead to complications, such as calcium oxalate urinary stones. While considerable research has been conducted on individual oxalate-degrading bacterial isolates, interactions between oxalate and the gut microbiota as a whole are unknown. We examined the reduction in oxalate excretion in a rat model following oral administration of fecal microbes from a mammalian herbivore adapted to a high oxalate diet or to fecal transplants consisting of two different formulations of mixed oxalate-degrading isolates. While all transplants elicited a significant reduction in oxalate excretion initially, the greatest effect was seen with fecal microbial transplants, which persisted even in the absence of dietary oxalate. The reduction in oxalate excretion in animals given fecal transplants corresponded with the establishment of diverse bacteria, including known oxalate-degrading bacteria and a cohesive network of bacteria centered on oxalate-degrading specialists from the Oxalobacteraceae family. Results suggested that the administration of a complete community of bacteria facilitates a cohesive balance in terms of microbial interactions. Our work offers important insights into the development of targeted bacteriotherapies intended to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in patients at risk for recurrent calcium oxalate stones as well as bacteriotherapies targeting other toxins for elimination. IMPORTANCE Oxalate is a central component in 80% of kidney stones. While mammals do not possess the enzymes to degrade oxalate, many gastrointestinal bacteria are efficient oxalate degraders. We examined the role of cohesive microbial networks for oxalate metabolism, using Sprague-Dawley rats as a model host. While the transplantation of oxalate-degrading bacteria alone to the Sprague-Dawley hosts did increase oxalate metabolism, fecal transplants from a wild mammalian herbivore, Neotoma albigula, had a significantly greater effect. Furthermore, the boost for oxalate metabolism persisted only in animals that received fecal transplants. Animals receiving fecal transplants had a more diverse and cohesive network of bacteria associated with the Oxalobacteraceae, a family known to consist of specialist oxalate-degrading bacteria, than did animals that received oxalate-degrading bacteria alone. Our results indicate that fecal transplants are more effective at transferring specific functions than are microbial specialists alone, which has broad implications for the development of bacteriotherapies.","[Miller, Aaron W.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Urol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Miller, Aaron W.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Immunol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Miller, Aaron W.; Dale, Colin; Dearing, M.

This study investigated the scale and pattern of genetic differentiation between bacteria of the family Acetobacteraceae isolated from the guts of Drosophila fruit flies, plant material and industrial fermentations. Genome-scale analysis of the phylogenetic relationships and predicted functions was conducted on 44 Acetobacteraceae isolates, including newly sequenced genomes from 18 isolates from wild and laboratory Drosophila. Isolates from the external environment and Drosophila could not be assigned to distinct phylogenetic groups, nor are their genomes enriched for any different sets of genes or category of predicted gene functions. In contrast, analysis of bacteria from laboratory Drosophila showed they were genetically distinct in their universal capacity to degrade uric acid (a major nitrogenous waste product of Drosophila) and absence of flagellar motility, while these traits vary among wild Drosophila isolates. Analysis of the competitive fitness of Acetobacter discordant for these traits revealed a significant fitness deficit for bacteria that cannot degrade uric acid in culture with Drosophila. We propose that, for wild populations, frequent cycling of Acetobacter between Drosophila and the external environment prevents genetic differentiation by maintaining selection for traits adaptive in both the gut and external habitats. However, laboratory isolates bear the signs of adaptation to persistent association with the Drosophila host under tightly defined environmental conditions.","[Winans, Nathan J.; Chouaia, Bessem; Chaston, John M.; Douglas, Angela E.; Newell, Peter D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Walter, Alec; Newell, Peter D.] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Biol Sci, Oswego, NY 13126 USA; [Chaston, John M.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY USA; [Winans, Nathan J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurosurg, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Chouaia, Bessem] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Milan, Italy","Newell, PD (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Biol Sci, Oswego, NY 13126 USA.",peter.newell@oswego.edu,,"chouaia, bessem/0000-0003-0726-7237","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1241099]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM095372]; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [1F32GM099374-01]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM095372, F32GM099374] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1241099] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1241099; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R01GM095372; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 1F32GM099374-01",,65,25,26,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

The bacteria that individuals acquire as they age may therefore have a profound effect on their future fitness. Since most birds are capable of flight, they can be widely distributed in and adapted to various ecosystems. Moreover, birds are also challenged by the need to digest a wide range of food resources in their guts. However, little is known regarding how the microbial community structure in birds, especially wild birds, changes with host age. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region to depict the microbial composition and structure in the adults and nestlings of Jankowski's bunting (Emberiza jankowskii), an endangered species of bird, during the breeding season. The results showed that the phyla Proteobacteria (52.45%), Firmicutes (13.87%), Bacteroidetes (5.76%), Actinobacteria (4.95%), Planctomycetes (4.36%), Euryarchaeota (3.20%), Acidobacteria (2.59%), Fusobacteria (2.24%), and Chloroflexi (1.8%) dominated the gut microbial communities in Jankowski's bunting. There was no significant difference in the alpha diversity and richness among different age groups. There was also no significant difference in species richness and diversity between the nestlings and adults. However, we observed different bacterial compositions at the genus level. The generaPhotobacteriumandBrochothrixwere detected only in the nestling groups (at days 3, 6, and 9), whileDiplorickettsiawas detected only in the adult group. In summary, this study can provide additional information regarding the intestinal microorganisms of wild passerine and grassland birds and provide theoretical evidence for methods to protect Jankowski's bunting.","[Shang, Weiping; Li, Shi; Zhang, Lishi; Jiang, Yunlei] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hui] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China","Jiang, YL (corresponding author), Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, 2888 Xincheng St, Changchun, Peoples R China.",jiangyl487@nenu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670398, 31172109, 31601856] Funding Source: Medline",,,38,0,0,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0343-8651,1432-0991,,CURR MICROBIOL,Curr.

Marmosets also feed heavily on tree gums and exudates, and they have evolved unique morphological and anatomical characteristics to facilitate gum feeding (gummivory). In this study, we characterized the fecal micro biomes of adult and infant animals from a captive population of common marmosets at the Callitrichid Research Center at the University of Nebraska at Omaha under their normal dietary and environmental conditions. The microbiomes of adult animals were dominated by species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Phascolarctobacterium, Megamonas, and Megasphaera. Culturing and genomic analysis of the Bifidobacterium populations from adult animals identified four known marmoset-associated species (B. reuteri, B. aesculapii, B. myosotis, and B. hapali) and three unclassified taxa of Bifidobacterium that are phylogenetically distinct. Species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed that these same species of Bifidobacterium are abundant members of the microbiome throughout the lives of the animals. Genomic loci in each Bifidobacterium species encode enzymes to support growth and major marmoset milk oligosaccharides during breastfeeding; however, metabolic islands that can support growth on complex polysaccharide substrates in the diets of captive adults (pectin, xyloglucan, and xylan), including loci in B. aesculapii that can support its unique ability to grow on arabinogalactan-rich tree gums, were species-specific. IMPORTANCE Bifidobacterium species are recognized as important, beneficial microbes in the human gut microbiome, and their ability colonize individuals at different stages of life is influenced by host, dietary, environmental, and ecological factors, which is poorly understood. The common marmoset is an emerging nonhuman primate model with a short maturation period, making this model amenable to study the microbiome throughout a life history. Features of the microbiome in captive marmosets are also shared with human gut microbiomes, including abundant populations of Bifidobacterium species. Our studies show that several species of Bifidobacterium are dominant members of the captive marmoset microbiome throughout their life history. Metabolic capacities in genomes of the marmoset Bifidobacterium species suggest species-specific adaptations to different components of the captive marmoset diet, including the unique capacity in B. aesculapii for degradation of gum arabic, suggesting that regular dietary exposure in cap- tivity may be important for preserving gum-degrading species in the microbiome.","[Zhu, Lifeng; Hassenstab, Haley; Mustoe, Aaryn; French, Jeffrey] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Zhu, Lifeng; Yang, Qinnan; Haute, Mallory J.

It has been hypothesized that the gastrointestinal microbiome of humans and other non-human primates may have played significant roles in host evolution by facilitating a range of dietary adaptations. We have undertaken a comparative sequencing survey of the gastrointestinal microbiomes of several non-human primate species, with the goal of better understanding how these microbiomes relate to the evolution of non-human primate diversity. Here we present a comparative analysis of gastrointestinal microbial communities from three different species of Old World wild monkeys. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed fecal samples from three different wild non-human primate species (black-and-white colobus [Colubus guereza], red colobus [Piliocolobus tephrosceles], and red-tailed guenon [Cercopithecus ascanius]). Three samples from each species were subjected to small subunit rRNA tag pyrosequencing. Firmicutes comprised the vast majority of the phyla in each sample. Other phyla represented were Bacterioidetes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Lentisphaerae, Tenericutes, Planctomycetes, Fibrobacateres, and TM7. Bray-Curtis similarity analysis of these microbiomes indicated that microbial community composition within the same primate species are more similar to each other than to those of different primate species. Comparison of fecal microbiota from non-human primates with microbiota of human stool samples obtained in previous studies revealed that the gut microbiota of these primates are distinct and reflect host phylogeny. Conclusion/Significance: Our analysis provides evidence that the fecal microbiomes of wild primates co-vary with their hosts, and that this is manifested in higher intraspecies similarity among wild primate species, perhaps reflecting species specificity of the microbiome in addition to dietary influences. These results contribute to the limited body of primate microbiome studies and provide a framework for comparative microbiome analysis between human and non-human primates as well as a comparative evolutionary understanding of the human microbiome.","[Yildirim, Suleyman; Yeoman, Carl J.; Wilson, Brenda A.; Stumpf, Rebecca M.; Leigh, Steven R.; White, Bryan A.] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sipos, Maksim] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Torralba, Manolito; Nelson, Karen E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Rockville, MD USA; [Wilson, Brenda A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Microbiol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Stumpf, Rebecca M.; Leigh, Steven R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [White, Bryan A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Yildirim, S (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",bwhite44@illinois.edu,"Yeoman, Carl/ABA-1906-2021","LEIGH, STEVEN/0000-0001-6844-7122; Yildirim, Suleyman/0000-0002-2752-1223",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0935347],"This project is funded by the National Science Foundation (grant no. 0935347).

Examining evidence accumulated in the literature up to date, we note that the gut microbiome is involved in the increased social behavior of domesticated species through the gut-immune system-brain axis. We further discuss data that point toward clear difference in the microbiome composition between domesticated species and closely related wild ancestors. This difference is related to changes in diet, due to co-habitation with humans, which leads to increase in Bifidobacteria and changes in carbohydrate metabolism. We note that these changes may also influence interaction between microbiome and virome. Virome is linked to the evolutionary changes through incorporation of retro-viruses into the host genome. Together with transposons these mobile genetic elements may also lead to changes in regulatory networks, and increase adaptive potential. Changes in microbiome of animals during co-habitation with humans should be considered as an important event during domestication process.","[Glazko, Valeriy, I; Glazko, Tatyana T.] FSBEI HPE Russian State Agr Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad, Moscow, Russia; [Glazko, Valeriy, I; Kosovsky, Yu G.; Glazko, Tatyana T.] FSBSI VA Afanasyev RI Fur & Rabbit Farming, Moscow, Russia; [Zybaylov, Boris L.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 4301 W Markham, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Glazko, Galina, V] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biomed Informat, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Zybaylov, BL (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 4301 W Markham, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.",blzybaylov@uams.edu,,"Zybailov, Boris/0000-0003-2432-9145",NIH Center of Biomedical Research ExcellenceUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P20GM121293],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The publication of this article was supported by P20GM121293/NIH Center of Biomedical Research Excellence.",,46,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,OCT,2021,31,10,,,,,1635,1645,9.59684E+15,10.1177/09596836211025975,,JUL 2021,11,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,UA0JC,WOS:000675169300001,,,,,2021-10-25,

Despite many studies documenting the microbial taxa associated with animals, the pattern and ecological determinants of among-animal variation in microbial communities are poorly understood. This study quantified the bacterial communities associated with natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Across five collections, each fly bore 16-78 OTUs, predominantly of the Acetobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. Positive relationships, mostly among related OTUs, dominated both the significant co-occurrences and co-association networks among bacteria, and OTUs with important network positions were generally of intermediate abundance and prevalence. The prevalence of most OTUs was well predicted by a neutral model suggesting that ecological drift and passive dispersal contribute significantly to microbiome composition. However, some Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae were present in more flies than predicted, indicative of superior among-fly dispersal. These taxa may be well-adapted to the Drosophila habitat from the perspective of dispersal as the principal benefit of the association to the microbial partners. Taken together, these patterns indicate that both stochastic processes and deterministic processes relating to the differential capacity for persistence in the host habitat and transmission between hosts contribute to bacterial community assembly in Drosophila melanogaster.","[Adair, Karen L.; Wilson, Marita; Bost, Alyssa; Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Douglas, AE (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.; Douglas, AE (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",aes326@cornell.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BIO1241099],We thank John McMullen for assistance with fly collections and Vince Martinson for technical advice.

If loss of gut biodiversity threatens the health (and therefore the fitness of individuals), and this loss can be correlated with the adaptive potential of a species in changing environments, measuring functional composition of the microbiota from non-invasive samples, such as faeces and skin swabs, could provide a useful and practical tool for determining conservation priorities. This article reviews the evidence for adaptive potential of microbiota in wild species, and proposes future directions. While there is ample indication of inter- and intra-specific variation in microbiota diversity, there is little evidence that diversity per se confers fitness. However, there are convincing examples showing that microbiota flexibility, composition and function may well be sources of adaptive potential, although case studies are relatively few, and the analytical approaches needed to demonstrate the mechanisms underlying host-microbiota interactions have only recently been developed.","[Hauffe, Heidi C.; Barelli, Claudia] Fdn E Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy; [Barelli, Claudia] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, 109 Davenport Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Barelli, Claudia] Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL USA","Hauffe, HC (corresponding author), Fdn E Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, Via E Mach 1, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy.",heidi.hauffe@fmach.it,"Hauffe, Heidi Christine/AAU-1684-2021","Hauffe, Heidi Christine/0000-0003-3098-8964",European UnionEuropean Commission [752399],The writing of this article has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 752399 (WILDGUT).,,106,15,15,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1566-0621,1572-9737,,CONSERV GENET,Conserv.

Here, we demonstrate, using murine models, that exposure of mice to dog-associated house dust protects against ovalbumin or cockroach allergen-mediated airway pathology. Protected animals exhibited significant reduction in the total number of airway T cells, down-regulation of Th2-related airway responses, as well as mucin secretion. Following dog-associated dust exposure, the cecal microbiome of protected animals was extensively restructured with significant enrichment of, amongst others, Lactobacillus johnsonii. Supplementation of wild-type animals with L. johnsonii protected them against both airway allergen challenge or infection with respiratory syncytial virus. L. johnsonii-mediated protection was associated with significant reductions in the total number and proportion of activated CD11c(+)/CD11b(+) and CD11c(+)/CD8(+) cells, as well as significantly reduced airway Th2 cytokine expression. Our results reveal that exposure to dog-associated household dust results in protection against airway allergen challenge and a distinct gastrointestinal microbiome composition. Moreover, the study identifies L. johnsonii as a pivotal species within the gastrointestinal tract capable of influencing adaptive immunity at remote mucosal surfaces in a manner that is protective against a variety of respiratory insults.","[Fujimura, Kei E.; Rauch, Marcus; Faruqi, Ali A.; Lynch, Susan V.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Gastroenterol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Boushey, Homer A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Demoor, Tine; Jang, Sihyug; Lukacs, Nicholas W.] Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Johnson, Christine C.] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Zoratti, Edward] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Div Allergy & Clin Immunol, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Ownby, Dennis] Med Coll Georgia, Dept Pediat, Augusta, GA 30912 USA","Lukacs, NW (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",nlukacs@umich.edu; susan.lynch@ucsf.edu,"Lukacs, Nicholas W/ABH-5583-2020",,"National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [P01AI089473-01A1]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [P01AI089473] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases P01AI089473-01A1.",,30,253,263,3,72,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

However, these studies are often confounded by numerous factors. Selection experiments offer unique opportunities to validate conclusions and test hypotheses generated by comparative studies. We used a replicated, 15-generation selection experiment on bank voles (Myodes glareolus) that have been selected for high swim-induced aerobic metabolism, predatory behavior toward crickets, and the ability to maintain body mass on a high-fiber, herbivorous diet. We predicted that selection on host performance, mimicking adaptive radiation, would result in distinct microbial signatures. We collected foregut and cecum samples from animals that were all fed the same nutrient-rich diet and had not been subjected to any performance tests. We conducted microbial inventories of gut contents by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We found no differences in cecal microbial community structure or diversity between control lines and the aerobic or predatory lines. However, the cecal chambers of voles selected for herbivorous capability harbored distinct microbial communities that exhibited higher diversity than control lines. The foregut communities of herbivorous-selected voles were also distinct from control lines. Overall, this experiment suggests that differences in microbial communities across herbivorous mammals may be evolved, and not solely driven by current diet or other transient factors.","[Kohl, Kevin D.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Sadowska, Edyta T.; Rudolf, Agata M.; Koteja, Pawel] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Dearing, M.

Here we employ wild three-spined sticklebacks as a model, combining field observations with complementary experimental manipulations of diet designed to mimic seasonal variation in the wild. We clearly demonstrate that season-specific diets are a powerful causal driver of major systemic immunophenotypic variation. This effect occurred largely independently of the bulk composition of the bacterial microbiome (which was also driven by season and diet) and of host condition, demonstrating neither of these, per se, constrain immune allocation in healthy individuals. Nonetheless, through observations in multiple anatomical compartments, differentially exposed to the direct effects of food and immunity, we found evidence of immune-driven control of bacterial community composition in mucus layers. This points to the interactive nature of the host-microbiome relationship, and is the first time, to our knowledge, that this causal chain (diet. immunity. microbiome) has been demonstrated in wild vertebrates. Microbiome effects on immunity were not excluded and, importantly, we identified outgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (especially mycolic-acid producing corynebacteria) as a consequence of the more animal-protein-rich summertime diet. This may provide part of the ultimate explanation (and possibly a proximal cue) for the dramatic immune re-adjustments that we saw in response to diet change.","[Friberg, Ida M.; Taylor, Joe D.; Jackson, Joseph A.] Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Salford, Lancs, England","Jackson, JA (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Salford, Lancs, England.",j.a.jackson@Salford.ac.uk,"Taylor, Joe/F-2196-2015","Taylor, Joe/0000-0003-0095-0869",Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [RPG-301],This work was funded by a research grant from the Leverhulme Trust (RPG-301) held by JJ at Aberystwyth University.,,55,8,8,3,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

AUREUS,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a pathobiont of humans as well as a multitude of animal species. The high prevalence of multi-resistant and more virulent strains of S. aureus necessitates the development of new prevention and treatment strategies for S. aureus infection. Major advances towards understanding the pathogenesis of S. aureus diseases have been made using conventional mouse models, i.e., by infecting naive laboratory mice with human-adapted S. aureus strains. However, the failure to transfer certain results obtained in these murine systems to humans highlights the limitations of such models. Indeed, numerous S. aureus vaccine candidates showed promising results in conventional mouse models but failed to offer protection in human clinical trials. These limitations arise not only from the widely discussed physiological differences between mice and humans, but also from the lack of attention that is paid to the specific interactions of S. aureus with its respective host. For instance, animal-derived S. aureus lineages show a high degree of host tropism and carry a repertoire of host-specific virulence and immune evasion factors. Mouse-adapted S. aureus strains, humanized mice, and microbiome-optimized mice are promising approaches to overcome these limitations and could improve transferability of animal experiments to human trials in the future.","[Mrochen, Daniel M.; Fernandes de Oliveira, Liliane M.; Raafat, Dina; Holtfreter, Silva] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Immunol & Transfus Med, Dept Immunol, Ferdinand Sauerbruch Str DZ 7, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany; [Raafat, Dina] Alexandria Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Alexandria 21521, Egypt","Mrochen, DM (corresponding author), Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Immunol & Transfus Med, Dept Immunol, Ferdinand Sauerbruch Str DZ 7, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany.",mrochend@uni-greifswald.de; liliane.fernandes@med.uni-greifswald.de; dina.raafat@med.uni-greifswald.de; silva.holtfreter@med.uni-greifswald.de,,"Mrochen, Daniel Michael/0000-0002-5893-1778; Raafat, Dina/0000-0002-3610-9863","BMBF, InfectControl 2020, project InVACFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FKZ 03ZZ0806B]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FKZ GRK1870/1]; European Social Fund, Card-ii-Omics [ESF/14-BMA55-0037/16]; DFG (German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [393148499]; Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Greifswald","This research was funded by BMBF, InfectControl 2020, project InVAC, FKZ 03ZZ0806B to D.M.M.; by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant number FKZ GRK1870/1 to L.M.F.d.O., and by the European Social Fund, Card-ii-Omics, ESF/14-BMA55-0037/16 to S.H.

Although STING has important functions in the host defense against pathogens and in autoimmune diseases, its physiological relevance in intestinal homeostasis is largely unknown. In this study, we show that STING(-/-) mice presented defective protective mechanisms of intestinal mucosa, including decreased number of goblet cells, diminished mucus production, and lower levels of secretory IgA, when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Fecal content and microbiota DNA could activate STING, indicating a role of this molecule in gut. Microbiota composition was altered in STING(-/-) mice toward a more inflammatory profile, evidencing a reduction in the Allobacolum and Bifidobacterium groups along with increase in Disulfovibrio bacteria. Absence of STING lead to decrease in induced intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and to increase in group 1 innate lymphoid cell (ILC1) as well as ILC3 frequencies and decrease in ILC2 in the colon. Development and function of Foxp3+ and LAP+ regulatory Tcells were also compromised in STING(-/-) mice. Moreover, these mice were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfateinduced colitis, T-cell-induced colitis, and enteric Salmonella typhimurium infection when compared with WT animals. Therefore, our results identify an important role of STING in maintaining gut homeostasis and also a protective effect in controlling gut inflammation.","[Canesso, M. C. C.; Lemos, L.; Neves, T.

Due to urbanization in the 20th century, they were gradually abandoned and became wild cattle straying in suburban Hong Kong. Recently, these cattle were observed to have become omnivorous by eating leftover barbeque food waste in country parks. Microbiome analysis was performed on fecal samples of the omnivorous cattle using deep sequencing and the resulting microbiome was compared with that of traditional herbivorous cattle in Southern China. A more diverse gut microbiome was observed in the omnivorous cattle, suggesting that microbiota diversity increases as diet variation increases. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Anaeroplasma, Anaerovorax, Bacillus, Coprobacillus and Solibacillus significantly increased and those of Anaerofustis, Butyricimonas, Campylobacter, Coprococcus, Dehalobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, rc4.4, RFN20, Succinivibrio and Turicibacter significantly decreased in the omnivorous group. The increase in microbial community levels of Bacillus and Anaerovorax likely attributes to the inclusion of meat in the diet; while the decrease in relative abundance of Coprococcus, Butyricimonas, Succinivibrio, Campylobacter and Phascolarctobacterium may reflect the reduction in grass intake. Furthermore, an increased consumption of resistant starch likely resulted in the increase in abundance of Anaeroplasma. In conclusion, a significant change in the gut microbial community was observed in the omnivorous cattle, suggesting that diet may be one of the factors that may signal an adaptation response by the cattle to maintain feed efficiency as a consequence of the change in environment.

Here, we compare the taxonomic composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities across three gut sections in synanthropic house mouse (Mus musculus) and a closely related non-synanthropic mound-building mouse (Mus spicilegus).ResultsUsing Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons, we found higher bacterial diversity in M. spicilegus and detected 11 bacterial operational taxonomic units with significantly different proportions. Notably, abundance of Oscillospira, which is typically higher in lean or outdoor pasturing animals, was more abundant in non-commensal M. spicilegus. ITS2-based barcoding revealed low diversity and high uniformity of gut fungi in both species, with the genus Kazachstania clearly dominant.ConclusionsThough differences in gut bacteria observed in the two species can be associated with their close association with humans, changes due to a move from commensalism to captivity would appear to have caused larger shifts in microbiota.","[Bendova, Barbora; Schmiedova, Lucie; Kreisinger, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bendova, Barbora; Pialek, Jaroslav; Dureje, Ludovit; Schmiedova, Lucie; Cizkova, Dagmar] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Studenec Res Facil, Brno, Czech Republic; [Martin, Jean-Francois] Univ Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, CBGP Montpellier,SupAgro,INRA, Montferrier Sur Lez, France","Kreisinger, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",jakubkreisinger@seznam.cz,"Schmiedova, Lucie/S-3351-2017; Kreisinger, Jakub/H-4020-2011","Schmiedova, Lucie/0000-0003-2180-5281; Kreisinger, Jakub/0000-0001-9375-9814; Cizkova, Dagmar/0000-0001-5031-7792; Pialek, Jaroslav/0000-0002-0829-7481",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [18-17796Y]; Grant Agency of Charles University [1501218]; SVV Project [260571/2020],"This study was supported through the Czech Science Foundation, Project no. 18-17796Y, and the Grant Agency of Charles University, Project no. 1501218.

Although much information has been gained through laboratory studies of acute starvation, little is known about how starvation affects an animal once food is again available (i.e. during the refeeding and recovery phases). Many animals exhibit a curious phenomenon - some seem to 'get better' at starving following exposure to one or more starvation events - by this we mean that they exhibit potentially adaptive responses, including reduced rates of mass loss, reduced metabolic rates, and lower costs of digestion. During subsequent refeedings they may also exhibit improved digestive efficiency and more rapid mass gain. Importantly, these responses can last until the next starvation bout or even be inherited and expressed in the subsequent generation. Currently, however, little is known about the molecular regulation and physiological mechanisms underlying these changes. Here, we identify areas of research that can fill in the most pressing knowledge gaps. In particular, we highlight how recently refined techniques (e.g. stable isotope tracers, quantitative magnetic resonance and thermal measurement) as well as next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g. RNA-seq, proteomics and holobiome sequencing) can address specific starvation-focused questions. We also describe outstanding unknowns ripe for future research regarding the timing and severity of starvation, and concerning the persistence of these responses and their interactions with other ecological stressors.","[McCue, Marshall D.] St Marys Univ, Dept Biol Sci, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA; [Terblanche, John S.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Benoit, Joshua B.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Biol Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA","McCue, MD (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Dept Biol Sci, San Antonio, TX 78228 USA.",mmccue1@stmarytx.edu,"Terblanche, John/AAB-4457-2020; McCue, Marshall/A-6227-2011","McCue, Marshall/0000-0003-1255-285X; Terblanche, John/0000-0001-9665-9405",,,,148,21,21,2,30,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

The skin and fur of mammals can host a wide variety of ectoparasites, many of which are phylogenetically diverse, specialized, and specifically adapted to their hosts. Among hematophagous dipteran parasites, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to serve as important attractants, leading parasites to compatible sources of blood meals. VOCs have been hypothesized to be mediated by host-associated bacteria, which may thereby indirectly influence parasitism. Host-associated bacteria may also influence parasitism directly, as has been observed in interactions between animal gut microbiota and malarial parasites. Hypotheses relating bacterial symbionts and eukaryotic parasitism have rarely been tested among humans and domestic animals, and to our knowledge have not been tested in wild vertebrates. In this study, we used Afrotropical bats, hematophagous ectoparasitic bat flies, and haemosporidian (malarial) parasites vectored by bat flies as a model to test the hypothesis that the vertebrate host microbiome is linked to parasitism in a wild system. We identified significant correlations between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages, as well as striking differences in skin microbial network characteristics between ectoparasitized and nonectoparasitized bats. We also identified links between the oral microbiome and presence of malarial parasites among miniopterid bats. Our results support the hypothesis that microbial symbionts may serve as indirect mediators of parasitism among eukaryotic hosts and parasites.","[Lutz, Holly L.; Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92161 USA; [Lutz, Holly L.; Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lutz, Holly L.; Dick, Carl W.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Negaunee Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Dick, Carl W.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA","Lutz, HL (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92161 USA.",hllutz@health.ucsd.edu,,"Gilbert, Jack/0000-0001-7920-7001; Lutz, Holly/0000-0001-6454-809X",National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology [1611948],"We thank the Kenya Wildlife Service and the Uganda Wildlife Authority for permission to conduct research in national parks, and Simon Musila of the National Museums of Kenya for his logistical support.

However, little is known about Culicoides imicola microbiota and its influence on this insect's biology. In this study, the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on C. imicola microbiota was characterized using shotgun-metagenomic sequencing of whole-body DNA samples. Wild-caught C. imicola adult nulliparous females were sampled in two locations from Sicily, Italy. The climatic variables of temperature and soil moisture from both localities were recorded together with potential host bloodmeal sources. Shared core microbiome among C. imicola populations included Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Halomonas, Candidatus Zinderia, Propionibacterium, and Schizosaccharomyces. Specific and unique taxa were also found in C. imicola from each location, highlighting similarities and differences in microbiome composition between the two populations. DNA and protein identification showed differences in host preferences between the two populations, with Homo sapiens and Canis lupus familiaris L. being the preferred bloodmeal source in both locations. A principal component analysis showed that the combined effect of host preferences (H. sapiens) and local soil moisture factors shape the microbiome composition of wild-caught populations of C. imicola. These results contribute to characterizing the role of the microbiome in insect adaptation and its utility in predicting geographic expansion of Culicoides species with potential implications for the control of vector-borne diseases.","[Diaz-Sanchez, S.; Hernandez-Jarguin, A.; de Mera, I.

Eight natural locations in Chile, where A. franciscana or A. persimilis occur, were sampled for analysis of free-living and gut-associated bacteria in water from nature and laboratory cultures. The highest ecological diversity (Shannon's index, H') was found in brines, it decreased in the gut of wild and laboratory animals, and in laboratory water. Significant differences in H' existed between brines and laboratory water, and between brines and gut of wild animals. The greatest similarity of bacterial community composition was between brines and the gut of field animals, suggesting a transient state of the gut microbiota. Sequences retrieved from DGGE patterns (n = 83) exhibited an average of 97.8 % identity with 41 bacterial genera from the phyla Proteobacteria (55.4 % of sequences match), Bacteroidetes (22.9 %), Actinobacteria (16.9 %) and Firmicutes (4.8 %). Environment-exclusive genera distribution was seen in Sphingomonas and Paenibacillus (gut of field animals), Amaricoccus and Ornithinimicrobium (gut of laboratory animals), and Hydrogenophaga (water of laboratory cultures).

Pre-emptive deworming is often recommended for equid translocations but eliminating parasites prior to translocation could cause disruptions in a balanced host-parasite relationship, adding an additional stressor to an already stressful intervention involving capture, transport, and adaptation to a new environment. Following a disease risk assessment, we decided against pre-emptive deworming and focused on monitoring the first group of nine translocated kulan in a large acclimatization enclosure prior to release. Over the 5-month acclimatization period, we regularly collected fecal samples and analyzed the shedding intensity of gastro-intestinal parasite eggs, obtained time budgets through behavioral observations, and visually assessed body condition. We identified strongyles (Strongylinae and Cyathostominae) and pinworms (Oxyuris equi) in fecal samples. All individuals shed strongyle eggs and two of the nine individuals had higher shedding intensities, but rarely reached levels for which deworming is recommended. All kulan appeared healthy throughout the observation period, aggressive interactions were very rare, and time budgets were very similar and dominated by feeding. Our results suggest that in translocation projects where the risk of introducing new parasites is minimal, pre-emptive treatment in wild equids can be replaced with non-invasive monitoring during the acclimatization period. We acknowledge that the small number of kulan, the large size of the enclosure, and the low temperatures during the animals stay in the acclimatization enclosure may all have reduced infestation pressure.","[Gliga, Diana S.; Walzer, Chris; Kaczensky, Petra] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Dept Interdisciplinary Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Petrova, Natalia] Moscow State Acad Vet Med & Biotechnol, Moscow, Russia; [Linnell, John D.

For example, across latitudinal gradients, some organisms may trade off between traits that maximize fitness components in one, but not both, of somatic maintenance or reproductive output. Latitudinal gradients in life history strategies are traditionally attributed to environmental selection on an animal's genotype, without any consideration of the possible impact of associated microorganisms (microbiota) on life history traits. Here, we show in Drosophila melanogaster, a key model for studying local adaptation and life history strategy, that excluding the microbiota from definitions of local adaptation is a major shortfall. First, we reveal that an isogenic fly line reared with different bacteria varies the investment in early reproduction versus somatic maintenance. Next, we show that in wild fruit flies, the abundance of these same bacteria was correlated with the latitude and life history strategy of the flies, suggesting geographic specificity of the microbiota composition. Variation in microbiota composition of locally adapted D. melanogaster could be attributed to both the wild environment and host genetic selection. Finally, by eliminating or manipulating the microbiota of fly lines collected across a latitudinal gradient, we reveal that host genotype contributes to latitude-specific life history traits independent of the microbiota and that variation in the microbiota can suppress or reverse the differences between locally adapted fly lines. Together, these findings establish the microbiota composition of a model animal as an essential consideration in local adaptation.","[Walters, Amber W.; Hughes, Rachel C.; Call, Tanner B.; Walker, Carson J.; Wilcox, Hailey; Petersen, Samara C.; Chaston, John M.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Rudman, Seth M.; Schmidt, Paul S.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Newell, Peter D.] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Biol Sci, Oswego, NY USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Douglas, Angela E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Ithaca, NY USA","Chaston, JM (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",john_chaston@byu.edu,,"Schmidt, Paul/0000-0002-8076-6705","NRSA postdoctoral fellowshipUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1F32GM099374-01]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM095372, R01GM100366]; Brigham Young University","NRSA postdoctoral fellowship, Grant/Award Number: 1F32GM099374-01; NIH, Grant/Award Number: R01GM095372 and R01GM100366; Brigham Young University",,130,14,15,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

In spite of known dental, manual, and locomotor adaptations, the intestinal anatomy of geladas is similar to that of other primates. We currently lack a clear understanding of the adaptations in digestive physiology necessary for this species to subsist on a graminoid-based diet, but digestion in other graminivores, such as ruminants, relies heavily on the microbial community residing in the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Furthermore, geladas form complex, multilevel societies, making them a suitable system for investigating links between sociality and the GI microbiota. Results: Here, we explore the gastrointestinal microbiota of gelada monkeys inhabiting an intact ecosystem and document how factors like multilevel social structure and seasonal changes in diet shape the GI microbiota. We compare the gelada GI microbiota to those of other primate species, reporting a gradient from geladas to herbivorous specialist monkeys to dietary generalist monkeys and lastly humans, the ultimate ecological generalists. We also compare the microbiotas of the gelada GI tract and the sheep rumen, finding that geladas are highly enriched for cellulolytic bacteria associated with ruminant digestion, relative to other primates. Conclusions: This study represents the first analysis of the gelada GI microbiota, providing insights into the adaptations underlying graminivory in a primate. Our results also highlight the role of social organization in structuring the GI microbiota within a society of wild animals.","[Trosvik, Pal; de Muinck, Eric J.; Rueness, Eli K.; Mekonnen, Addisu] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, Oslo, Norway; [Fashing, Peter J.; Nga Nguyen] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Anthropol, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Fashing, Peter J.; Nga Nguyen] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Environm Studies Program, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Beierschmitt, Evan C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Callingham, Kadie R.] Bwindi Gorilla Project, Bwindi Impenetrable Natl Pk, Kanungu, Uganda; [Kraus, Jacob B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anthropol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Trew, Thomas H.] Cleve Lodge, Minster Rd, Ramsgate CT12 4BA, Kent, England; [Moges, Amera] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Biol, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Mekonnen, Addisu] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Venkataraman, Vivek V.] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Trosvik, P (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066, Oslo, Norway.",pal.trosvik@ibv.uio.no,"Mekonnen, Addisu/U-6087-2018","Mekonnen, Addisu/0000-0001-8403-1071; de Muinck, Eric/0000-0001-5606-3172",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [230796/F20]; Rufford Small Grants [11727-1]; People's Trust for Endangered Species; San Diego Zoo; California State University Fullerton; Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation; Primate Conservation Inc.; Gibson,"This study was funded by Research Council of Norway grant 230796/F20, Rufford Small Grants 11727-1, and the People's Trust for Endangered Species.

This regenerative response in areas adjacent to breaches in the epithelial barrier depends on the gut microbiota because ColEP proliferation is markedly diminished in germ-free animals. Analysis of conventionally raised C57BL/6 (B6) knockout mice lacking the Toll-like receptor signal transduction pathway component Myd88 and wild-type animals transplanted with Myd88(-/-) bone marrow, revealed that Myd88-mediated signaling through mesenchymal cells is also required for the ColEP response. Studies of B6 Csf1(op/op) (lacking macrophages) mice, Rag1(-/-) mice, and wild-type mice treated with neutrophil-specific Gr1 mAbs, disclosed that macrophages but not lymphocytes or neutrophils are necessary. GeneChip analysis of laser-capture-microdissected mesenchymal cells coupled with immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies showed that, during the regenerative response, macrophages in the pericryptal stem cell niche express genes associated with their activation and extend processes to directly contact ColEPs near the crypt base. GeneChip analysis also identified a number of potential molecular mediators of regeneration expressed in the pericryptal progenitor niche, including secreted factors that stimulate epithelial proliferation and proteins involved in extracellular matrix and basement membrane function, stability, and growth factor binding. Together, these studies indicate that the colonic epithelial progenitor niche is a dynamic structure in which macrophages function as mobile cellular transceivers that coordinate inputs from luminal microbes and injured epithelium and transmit regenerative signals to neighboring ColEPs.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol & Pharmacol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Genome Sci, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Stappenbeck, TS (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, Box 8118,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",stappenb@pathology.wusti.edu,"Mills, Jason/AAA-6688-2021",,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [U01DK063483, K08DK002954] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIDDK NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [DK 02954, U01 DK063483, DK 63483, DK 06220, K08 DK002954] Funding Source: Medline",,,43,433,445,1,25,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Antibiotic treatment is considered only in severe cases and immune-compromised patients. The beneficial effects of antibiotic therapy and the consequences for adaptive immune responses are not well understood. We used a mouse model for Salmonella diarrhea to assess the effects of per os treatment with ciprofloxacin (15 mg/kg of body weight intragastrically 2 times/day, 5 days) or parenteral ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 5 days), two common drugs used in human patients. The therapeutic and adverse effects were assessed with respect to generation of a protective adaptive immune response, fecal pathogen excretion, and the emergence of nonsymptomatic excreters. In the mouse model, both therapies reduced disease severity and reduced the level of fecal shedding. In line with clinical data, in most animals, a rebound of pathogen gut colonization/fecal shedding was observed 2 to 12 days after the end of the treatment. Yet, levels of pathogen shedding and frequency of appearance of nonsymptomatic excreters did not differ from those for untreated controls. Moreover, mice treated intraperitoneally with ceftriaxone developed an adaptive immunity protecting the mice from enteropathy in wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium challenge infections. In contrast, the mice treated intragastrically with ciprofloxacin were not protected. Thus, antibiotic treatment regimens can disrupt the adaptive immune response, but treatment regimens may be optimized in order to preserve the generation of protective immunity. It might be of interest to determine whether this also pertains to human patients. In this case, the mouse model might be a tool for further mechanistic studies.","[Endt, Kathrin; Maier, Lisa; Kaeppeli, Rina; Barthel, Manja; Misselwitz, Benjamin; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich] ETH, Inst Mikrobiol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kremer, Marcus] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Allgemeine Pathol & Pathol Anat, Munich, Germany","Hardt, WD (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Mikrobiol, Schmelzbergstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hardt@micro.biol.ethz.ch,"Misselwitz, Benjamin/L-7193-2016","Misselwitz, Benjamin/0000-0002-8719-5175; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich/0000-0002-9892-6420",Novartis Stiftung fur Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung,This work was funded in part by a grant from the Novartis Stiftung fur Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung to W.-D.H.,,58,14,14,1,6,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0066-4804,1098-6596,,ANTIMICROB AGENTS CH,Antimicrob.

Because initial swarming of neutrophils at the site of infection occurs within minutes, rather than the hours required to induce emergency granulopoiesis, the relevance of having high numbers of these cells available at any one time is obvious. We observed that germ-free (GF) animals show delayed clearance of an apathogenic bacterium after systemic challenge. In this article, we show that the size of the bone marrow myeloid cell pool correlates strongly with the complexity of the intestinal microbiota. The effect of colonization can be recapitulated by transferring sterile heat-treated serum from colonized mice into GF wild-type mice. TLR signaling was essential for microbiota-driven myelopoiesis, as microbiota colonization or transferring serum from colonized animals had no effect in GF MyD88(-/-) TICAM1(-/-) mice. Amplification of myelopoiesis occurred in the absence of microbiota-specific IgG production. Thus, very low concentrations of microbial Ags and TLR ligands, well below the threshold required for induction of adaptive immunity, sets the bone marrow myeloid cell pool size. Coevolution of mammals with their microbiota has probably led to a reliance on microbiota-derived signals to provide tonic stimulation to the systemic innate immune system and to maintain vigilance to infection. This suggests that microbiota changes observed in dysbiosis, obesity, or antibiotic therapy may affect the cross talk between hematopoiesis and the microbiota, potentially exacerbating inflammatory or infectious states in the host.","[Balmer, Maria L.; Geuking, Markus B.; Li, Hai; Mccoy, Kathy D.; Sack, Emma; Macpherson, Andrew J.] Univ Bern, Univ Clin Visceral Surg & Med, Dept Clin Res, Div Gastroenterol, Murtenstr 35, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; [Schuerch, Christian M.; Ochsenbein, Adrian F.] Univ Bern, Dept Clin Res Tumor Immunol, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; [Saito, Yasuyuki; Kovtonyuk, Larisa V.; Manz, Markus G.] Univ Zurich Hosp, Div Hematol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cuenca, Miguelangel; Hapfelmeier, Siegfried] Univ Bern, Inst Infect Dis, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; [Sack, Emma] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Microbiol, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Macpherson, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Univ Clin Visceral Surg & Med, Dept Clin Res, Div Gastroenterol, Murtenstr 35, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.",emma.slack@micro.biol.ethz.ch; andrew.macpherson@insel.ch,"Saito, Yasuyuki/AAD-1436-2019; Slack, Emma/AAD-5837-2019; Balmer, Maria Luisa/AAB-8993-2021; Saito, Yasuyuki/C-2541-2015; Slack, Emma/B-1612-2016; Balmer, Maria L/A-8546-2013; Schurch, Christian/L-6188-2019; Hapfelmeier, Siegfried/B-6005-2011; Li, Hai/AAI-9163-2021; Harris, Nicola Laraine/E-5342-2019","Saito, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-9291-1383; Slack, Emma/0000-0002-2473-1145; Balmer, Maria Luisa/0000-0003-0356-6352; Saito, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-9291-1383; Slack, Emma/0000-0002-2473-1145; Schurch, Christian/0000-0002-1792-1768; Hapfelmeier, Siegfried/0000-0002-6913-7932; Manz, Markus/0000-0002-4676-7931; Li, Hai/0000-0002-4762-9362; Harris, Nicola Laraine/0000-0003-2922-0210; Ochsenbein, Adrian/0000-0003-1773-5436; Cuenca, Miguelangel/0000-0003-3435-9102","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [310030-124732, 313600-123736, 313600-123736/1, 133132, 310030_146528/1]; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Genaxen Foundation; Oncosuisse; European Research Council under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [281785, 281904]; Bernische Krebsliga; Gertrud-Hagmann-Stiftung fur Malignomforschung; SwissLife Jubilaumsstiftung; Ambizione fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation [PZ00P3_136742]","A.J.M. was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grants 310030-124732 and 313600-123736), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Genaxen Foundation.

How this balance is achieved is not fully understood, and disruption of this relationship can lead to disease. Excessive inflammatory responses to resident microbes are characteristic of certain gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The immune dysregulation of IBD has complex genetic underpinnings that cannot be fully recapitulated with single-gene-knockout models. A deeper understanding of the genetic regulation of innate immune responses to resident microbes requires the ability to measure immune responses in the presence and absence of the microbiota using vertebrate models with complex genetic variation. Here, we describe a new gnotobiotic vertebrate model to explore the natural genetic variation that contributes to differences in innate immune responses to microbiota. Threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, has been used to study the developmental genetics of complex traits during the repeated evolution from ancestral oceanic to derived freshwater forms. We established methods to rear germ-free stickleback larvae and gnotobiotic animals monoassociated with single bacterial isolates. We characterized the innate immune response of these fish to resident gut microbes by quantifying the neutrophil cells in conventionally reared monoassociated or germ-free stickleback from both oceanic and freshwater populations grown in a common intermediate salinity environment. We found that oceanic and freshwater fish in the wild and in the laboratory share many intestinal microbial community members. However, oceanic fish mount a strong immune response to residential microbiota, whereas freshwater fish frequently do not. A strong innate immune response was uniformly observed across oceanic families, but this response varied among families of freshwater fish. The gnotobiotic stickleback model that we have developed therefore provides a platform for future studies mapping the natural genetic basis of the variation in immune response to microbes.","[Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn; Small, Clayton M.; Currey, Mark; Cresko, William A.] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn; Mittge, Erika K.; Agarwal, Meghna; Guillemin, Karen] Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Milligan-Myhre, Kathryn] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA","Milligan-Myhre, K (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.; Milligan-Myhre, K (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Inst Mol Biol, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.; Milligan-Myhre, K (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",kmillig1@uaa.alaska.edu,"Cresko, William/H-4010-2014","Cresko, William/0000-0002-3496-8074","National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P50GM098911, F32DK096753, R24RR032670]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [R24RR032670] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [F32DK096753] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P50GM098911] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R24OD011199] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers P50GM098911 (to K.G. and W.A.C.), F32DK096753 (to K.M.-M.) and R24RR032670 (to W.A.C.).

In species in which social status determines access to resources, socially dominant animals maintain better immune processes and health status than subordinates. As high species diversity is an index of ecosystem health, the intestinal biome of healthier, socially dominant animals should be more diverse than those of subordinates. Gradual colonization of the juvenile intestine after birth predicts lower intestinal biome diversity in juveniles than adults. We tested these predictions on the effect of: (1) age (juvenile/adult) and (2) social status (low/high) on bacterial microbiome and eukaryome diversity and composition in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a highly social, female-dominated carnivore in which social status determines access to resources. We comprehensively screened feces from 35 individually known adult females and 7 juveniles in the Serengeti ecosystem for bacteria and eukaryotes, using a set of 48 different amplicons (4 for bacterial 16S, 44 for eukaryote 18S) in a multi-amplicon sequencing approach. We compared sequence abundances to classical coprological egg or oocyst counts. For all parasite taxa detected in more than six samples, the number of sequence reads significantly predicted the number of eggs or oocysts counted, underscoring the value of an amplicon sequencing approach for quantitative measurements of parasite load. In line with our predictions, our results revealed a significantly less diverse microbiome in juveniles than adults and a significantly higher diversity of eukaryotes in high-ranking than low-ranking animals. We propose that free-ranging wildlife can provide an intriguing model system to assess the adaptive value of intestinal biome diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes.","[Heitlinger, Emanuel] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Res Grp Ecol & Evolut Mol Parasite Host Interact, Berlin, Germany; [Heitlinger, Emanuel] Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, Mol Parasitol, Berlin, Germany; [Ferreira, Susana C.

Here, we generated 5,596 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the gut metagenomes of 180 predominantly wild animal species representing 5 classes, in addition to 14 existing animal gut metagenome data sets. The MAGs comprised 1,522 species-level genome bins (SGBs), most of which were novel at the species, genus, or family level, and the majority were enriched in host versus environment metagenomes. Many traits distinguished SGBs enriched in host or environmental biomes, including the number of antimicrobial resistance genes. We identified 1,986 diverse biosynthetic gene clusters; only 23 clustered with any MIBiG database references. Gene-based assembly revealed tremendous gene diversity, much of it host or environment specific. Our MAG and gene data sets greatly expand the microbial genome repertoire and provide a broad view of microbial adaptations to the vertebrate gut. IMPORTANCE Microbiome studies on a select few mammalian species (e.g., humans, mice, and cattle) have revealed a great deal of novel genomic diversity in the gut microbiome. However, little is known of the microbial diversity in the gut of other vertebrates. We studied the gut microbiomes of a large set of mostly wild animal species consisting of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Unfortunately, we found that existing reference databases commonly used for metagenomic analyses failed to capture the microbiome diversity among vertebrates. To increase database representation, we applied advanced metagenome assembly methods to our animal gut data and to many public gut metagenome data sets that had not been used to obtain microbial genomes. Our resulting genome and gene cluster collections comprised a great deal of novel taxonomic and genomic diversity, which we extensively characterized. Our findings substantially expand what is known of microbial genomic diversity in the vertebrate gut.","[Youngblut, Nicholas D.; De la Cuesta-Zuluaga, Jacobo; Dauser, Silke; Ley, Ruth E.] Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Microbiome Sci, Tubingen, Germany; [Reischer, Georg H.; Schuster, Nathalie; Farnleitner, Andreas H.] TU Wien, Res Grp Environm Microbiol & Mol Diagnost, Inst Chem Environm & Biosci Engn, Vienna, Austria; [Reischer, Georg H.; Farnleitner, Andreas H.] ICC Interuniv Cooperat Ctr Water & Hlth, Vienna, Austria; [Walzer, Chris; Stalder, Gabrielle] Univ Vet Med, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Walzer, Chris] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY USA; [Farnleitner, Andreas H.] Karl Landsteiner Univ Hlth Sci, Res Div Water Qual & Hlth, Krems An Der Donau, Austria","Youngblut, ND (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Dev Biol, Dept Microbiome Sci, Tubingen, Germany.",nyoungblut@tuebingen.mpg.de,"Ley, Ruth E/M-8542-2014; Reischer, Georg Hubert/N-6381-2017","Ley, Ruth E/0000-0002-9087-1672; Reischer, Georg/0000-0002-3962-8685; de la Cuesta-Zuluaga, Juan Jacobo/0000-0002-7369-992X; Walzer, Chris/0000-0002-0437-5147; Youngblut, Nicholas/0000-0002-7424-5276","Department of Microbiome Science at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P23900, P22032]; Science Call 2015 Resource und Lebensgrundlage Wasser Project - Niederosterreichische Forschungs- und Bildungsgesellschaft (NFB) [SC15-016]",This work was supported by the Department of Microbiome Science at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology.

Elevated habitat is a pivotal factor for wild sable survival and reproduction, and the adaptability is in part enabled through their gut microbial communities. Our observations show that despite having been forced to migrate from low altitudes to high altitudes because of anthropogenic habitat encroachment, wild sables showed robustness in adapting to harsh conditions. Additionally, we propose that the crucial factor enabling wild sables to survive in changeable environments was their gut microbial communities. It is widely understood that harsh conditions, such as high altitude and low temperature environments, have an adverse effect on wild fauna survival. However, our results suggested that increasing altitude can enhance some functions in wild sable gut microbial communities. In recent decades, wild sable (Carnivora Mustelidae Martes zibellina) habitats, which are often natural forests, have been squeezed by anthropogenic disturbances such as clear-cutting, tilling and grazing. Sables tend to live in sloped areas with relatively harsh conditions. Here, we determine effects of environmental factors on wild sable gut microbial communities between high and low altitude habitats using Illumina Miseq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Our results showed that despite wild sable gut microbial community diversity being resilient to many environmental factors, community composition was sensitive to altitude. Wild sable gut microbial communities were dominated by Firmicutes (relative abundance 38.23%), followed by Actinobacteria (30.29%), and Proteobacteria (28.15%). Altitude was negatively correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes, suggesting sable likely consume more vegetarian food in lower habitats where plant diversity, temperature and vegetation coverage were greater. In addition, our functional genes prediction and qPCR results demonstrated that energy/fat processing microorganisms and functional genes are enriched with increasing altitude, which likely enhanced metabolic functions and supported wild sables to survive in elevated habitats. Overall, our results improve the knowledge of the ecological impact of habitat change, providing insights into wild animal protection at the mountain area with hash climate conditions.","[Su, Lantian; Tan, Haoxin; Khalid, Muhammed] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Agr & Biol, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinxin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Instrumental Anal Ctr, Dongchuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Jin, Guangyao] Heilongjiang Acad Forestry, Inst Wild Anim, Haping Rd 134, Harbin 150081, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yue] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Area, Hexing Rd 26, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Romantschuk, Martin; Hui, Nan] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Niemenkatu 73, Lahti 15140, Finland; [Yin, Shan] Minist Educ, Minist Sci & Technol, Shanghai Yangtze River Delta Ecoenvironm Change &, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Yin, Shan] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Shanghai Urban Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Hui, N (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Niemenkatu 73, Lahti 15140, Finland.",lanter_shawn666@sjtu.edu.cn; xinxin.liu@sjtu.edu.cn; changzhao@sjtu.edu.cn; mayue@nefu.edu.cn; hostage@sjtu.edu.cn; kokub32@gmail.com; Martin.romantschuk@helsinki.fi; yinshan@sjtu.edu.cn; nan.hui@sjtu.edu.cn,"Khalid, Muhammad/AAU-4383-2021; Hui, Nan/H-3560-2018","Hui, Nan/0000-0001-8517-8454; Yin, Shan/0000-0003-0293-4176",Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [42007048]; Shanghai Pujiang ProjectShanghai Pujiang Program [2020-000224],This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (project number: 42007048) and Shanghai Pujiang Project (Application number: 2020-000224).,,70,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAR,2021,11,3,,,,,,,865,10.3390/ani11030865,,,18,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences",Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,RD0PM,WOS:000633191500001,33803658,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-10-25,

A lingering controversy is whether the dingo has been tamed and has now reverted to its ancestral wild state or whether its ancestors were domesticated and it now resides on the continent as a feral dog. The goal of this article is to place the discussion onto a theoretical framework, highlight what is currently known about dingo origins and taxonomy and then make a series of experimentally testable organismal, cellular and biochemical predictions that we propose can focus future research. Discussion We consider a canid that has been unconsciously selected as a tamed animal and the endpoint of methodical or what we now call artificial selection as a domesticated animal. We consider wild animals that were formerly tamed as untamed and those wild animals that were formerly domesticated as feralized. Untamed canids are predicted to be marked by a signature of unconscious selection whereas feral animals are hypothesized to be marked by signatures of both unconscious and artificial selection. First, we review the movement of dingo ancestors into Australia. We then discuss how differences between taming and domestication may influence the organismal traits of skull morphometrics, brain and size, seasonal breeding, and sociability. Finally, we consider cellular and molecular level traits including hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic position of dingoes, metabolic genes that appear to be under positive selection and the potential for micronutrient compensation by the gut microbiome. Conclusions Western Australian Government policy is currently being revised to allow the widespread killing of the Australian dingo. These policies are based on an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary history of the canid and assume the dingo is feralized. However, accumulated evidence does not definitively show that the dingo was ever domesticated and additional focused research is required. We suggest that incorporating ancient DNA data into the debate concerning dingo origins will be pivotal to understanding the evolutionary history of the canid. Further, we advocate that future morphological, behavioural and genetic studies should focus on including genetically pure Alpine and Desert dingoes and not dingo-dog hybrids. Finally, we propose that future studies critically examine genes under selection in the dingo and employ the genome from a wild canid for comparison.","[Ballard, J.

All strains were susceptible to linezolid and teicoplanin. Rates of nonsusceptibility (including resistant and intermediate categories) to other 16 antimicrobials tested varied from 69.3% to 0.4%, A considerable proportion (48.0%) of the strains was multidrug-resistant and diverse genetic determinants associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified. Tetracycline-resistant strains carried the tet(M) and/or tet(L) genes. Macrolides resistance was associated with the erm(B), erm(A) and mefA genes, while 43.2% of the isolates were negative for the investigated genes. High-level resistance to gentamicin associated with the aac(6')-le-aph(2 '')-la gene was detected in one E. faecalis strain. The two strains presenting high-level resistance to streptomycin were negative for the ant(6')-Ia, ant(3')-Ia, ant(9')-Ia and ant(9')-Ib genes. The vat(D) gene was found in all the 47 quinupristin/dalfopristin resistant strains identified as non-E. faecalis. Analysis of PFGE profiles of E. hirae strains after restriction with SmaI demonstrated the occurrence of five clonal groups. The predominant E. hirae clone was distributed among birds in the two institutions, suggesting that this clone was well adapted to the host and environments investigated. The four clonal groups identified among E. faecalis were composed by small numbers of strains and, generally, restricted to birds in the same sector. The occurrence of enterococcal strains exhibiting antimicrobial resistance traits and carrying genetic determinants that represent potential threats to the health of both humans and animals, in the intestinal microbiota of A. aestiva, highlights the need for additional monitoring studies to elucidate the population structure and the dynamics of transmission of these microorganisms among animals, humans and the environment.

Long-term use of antibiotics in birds leads to the development of many drug-resistant microorganisms, has a negative impact on the environment and the antibiotic residues in poultry meat pose hazards to consumers' health. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics used in poultry are good alternatives for antibiotic and antibiotic growth stimulants. However, such additives must be adapted to the species, age and intended use of birds. Our newly developed synbiotic formulas which comprised three, four or five strains ofLactobacillussp., as well asS. cerevisiaeand inulin, were administered in feed for meat-type chickens throughout the 42-day experimental period. The results showed that our new synbiotics do not have any unfavorable influence on chicken health and may modulate the immune response and biochemical parameters. The results are very promising, and our synbiotics can be considered as products for commercial use in poultry. However, these findings should be confirmed in future field experiments. In this study, the influence of new multi-strain synbiotics on chicken growth performance, hematology, serum biochemistry and immunity was explored. Each synbiotic preparation (A, B and C) comprised three, four or five strains ofLactobacillussp., respectively, as well asS. cerevisiaeand inulin. All strains used in the synbiotics originated from wild-type strains from animal farms in Poland. Six groups of chickens, ROSS 308 line, were fed with three different synbiotics at a dose of 0.5 g/1 kg of feed. Body weight, as well as the biochemical and hematological parameters of the animals in each study group, were determined on the 7th, 14th, 28th and 42nd day of life. Body weight on day 42 differed between groups and was the highest in control group. This group also had the highestfeed conversion ratio (FCR) value. All measured biochemical parameters were in the normal ranges for poultry; however, we observed a lower alkaline phosphatase (AP) concentration on day 7 in the groups fed with synbiotics, which correlated with a lower level of triglycerides in those groups. The aspartate transaminase (AST) concentration was significantly lower in all groups on day 42 in comparison with the control. On day 7, the control group showed the highest concentration of Ca, K and P. Other parameters did not differ significantly throughout the experiment. All groups showed a similar tendency of increase in the red blood cells (RBC) count according to the age of the birds. Every white blood cells (WBC) population showed differences in the proportions between T and B lymphocytes. The T cell and monocyte counts increased until day 28 in all groups. The results showed that our newly developed synbiotic formulas do not have any unfavorable influence on chicken health and may modulate immune response and biochemical parameters. However, this hypothesis needs to be evaluated in future experiments.","[Zbikowski, Artur; Pawlowski, Karol; Dolka, Beata; Nerc, Joanna; Szeleszczuk, Piotr] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Vet Med, Dept Pathol & Vet Diagnost, Nowoursynowska 159c St, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Slizewska, Katarzyna] Lodz Univ Technol, Inst Fermentat Technol & Microbiol, Dept Biotechnol & Food Sci, Wolczanska 171-173, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland","Zbikowski, A (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Vet Med, Dept Pathol & Vet Diagnost, Nowoursynowska 159c St, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",artur_zbikowski@sggw.edu.pl; karol_pawlowski@sggw.edu.pl; katarzyna.slizewska@p.lodz.pl; beata_dolka@sggw.edu.pl; joanna_nerc@sggw.edu.pl; piotr_szeleszczuk@sggw.edu.pl,,"Pawlowski, Karol/0000-0003-4565-2873; /0000-0001-8836-5351; Zbikowski, Artur/0000-0001-5219-2065",Program of Applied Research - National Centre for Research and Development [PBS3/A8/32/2015],"This research was supported by a grant from the Program of Applied Research funded by the National Centre for Research and Development no.
