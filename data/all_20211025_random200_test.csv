Effect of Periodontal Pathogens on Total Bone Volume Fraction: A Phenotypic Study,"Zhang Z-Y, Xie M-R, Liu Y, Li Y-X, Wu K, Ding Y-M",2020,Article,10.1007/s11596-020-2243-8,"Studies have shown that periodontal pathogens can enter the bloodstream, causing a series of reactions that can lead to a variety of systemic diseases. Epidemiological investigations also found a tight correlation between periodontitis (PD) and osteoporosis. This study aimed to further explore the effect of periodontal pathogens on bone volume fraction like bone tissue and mass, and explain the relationship between PD and osteoporosis. Sprague Dawley rats (female, 16 weeks old) were divided into the wild-type (WT) control group (n=9) and PD group (n=9). After eight weeks, periodontal tissues and ligatures, the fourth lumbar vertebra, the femur, the tibia, and blood were extracted and analyzed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), respectively. We found that the bone mass of the lumbar vertebra, femur, and tibia was decreased in the PD group. The number of osteoclasts was higher in bone tissue in the PD group than in the WT group (P<0.05). The levels of inflammatory mediators and type I collagen C-terminal peptide (CTX-1) were higher in the PD group than in the WT group (P<0.05), although no significant difference in bone glutamic acid protein (BGP) levels was observed (P>0.05). In addition, we detected several periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, in blood samples from rats in the PD group. These findings suggest that periodontal pathogens can enter the blood circulation from periodontal tissue, promote a systemic inflammation response, and subsequently reduce systemic bone density. © 2020, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.","bone mineral density; inflammation; periodontal pathogens; periodontitis; systemic disease; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; animal; blood; bone density; diagnostic imaging; disease model; female; femur; fusobacterium nucleatum; human; isolation and purification; lumbar vertebra; metabolism; micro-computed tomography; microbiology; osteoclast; osteoporosis; pathology; periodontitis; porphyromonas gingivalis; rat; sprague dawley rat; tibia; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; animals; blood; bone density; disease models, animal; female; femur; fusobacterium nucleatum; humans; lumbar vertebrae; osteoclasts; osteoporosis; periodontitis; porphyromonas gingivalis; rats; rats, sprague-dawley; tibia; x-ray microtomography",No
Gut Microbiota of Wild and Captive Alpine Musk Deer (Moschus chrysogaster),"Sun Y, Sun Y, Shi Z, Liu Z, Zhao C, Lu T, Gao H, Zhu F, Chen R, Zhang J, Pan R, Li B, Teng L, Guo S",2020,Article,10.3389/fmicb.2019.03156,"As for the wild animals, their diet components are always changed, so that we have to monitor such changes by analyzing the modification of intestinal microbial community. Such effort allows us to amend their conservation strategies and tactics accordingly so that they are able to appropriately adapt to the new environment and dietary selection. In this study we focus on the gut flora of two groups of an endangered species, Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), wild group (WG) which is compared with that of the individuals of the same species but kept in the captivities (CG), a control group. Such a project is aimed to work out whether the composition of the gut microbes has significantly been changed due to captive feedings. To do so, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize gut bacteria of the musk deer from the two groups. The results show that there is a significant difference in community structure of the bacteria: WG shows significant enrichment of Firmicutes and depletion of Bacteroidetes, while CG has a significant abundance of Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota. Metagenomics was used to analyze the differences in functional enzymes between the two groups. The related results indicate that genes in WG are mostly related to the enzymes digesting cellulose and generating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) for signaling pathways, but CG shows enrichment in methanogenesis, including the CO2/H2 pathway and the methylotrophic pathway. Thus, this study indicates that the Firmicutes-rich gut microbiota in the WG enables individuals to maximize their energy intake from the cellulose, and has significant abundance of Euryarchaeota and methanogenesis pathways that allow them to reduce redundant energy consumption in methane metabolism, ensuring them to adapt to the wild environments. © Copyright © 2020 Sun, Sun, Shi, Liu, Zhao, Lu, Gao, Zhu, Chen, Zhang, Pan, Li, Teng and Guo.",firmicutes to bacteroides/prevotella (f/b) ratio; gut microbiota; methane; short-chain fatty acid; wild musk deer; animal experiment; animal model; article; bacteroidetes; caloric intake; clostridium; community structure; controlled study; dna extraction; energy metabolism; environmental factor; feces microflora; firmicutes; gene function; gene sequence; intestine flora; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial metabolism; moschus; nonhuman; prevotella; principal component analysis; proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; sequence analysis; taxonomy,Yes
Native microbial colonization of Drosophila melanogaster and its use as a model of Enterococcus faecalis pathogenesis,"Cox CR, Gilmore MS",2007,Article,10.1128/IAI.01496-06,"Enterococci are commensal organisms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of a broad range of mammalian and insect hosts, but they are also leading causes of nosocomial infection. Little is known about the ecological role of enterococci in the GI tract consortia. To develop a tractable model for studying the roles of these organisms as commensals and pathogens, we characterized the Drosophila melanogaster microflora and examined the occurrence of enterococci in the gastrointestinal consortium of Drosophila. In a survey of laboratory-reared Drosophila and wild-captured flies, we found that Drosophila was naturally colonized by representatives of five bacterial phyla. Among these organisms were several species of enterococci, including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gattinaraum, and Enterococcus durans, as well as a previously detected but uncultured Enterococcus species. Drosophila could be cured of enterococcal carriage by antibiotic treatment and could be reassociated with laboratory strains. High-level colonization by a well-characterized strain expressing the enterococcal cytolysin was found to be detrimental to Drosophila compared to the effect of an isogenic, noncytolytic control. The anatomical distribution of enterococci in the Drosophila GI tract was determined by immunohistochemical staining of thin sections of naturally colonized and reassociated flies.

Temporal Dynamics of Chronic Inflammation on the Cecal Microbiota in IL-10-/- Mice,"Overstreet A-MC, Ramer-Tait AE, Suchodolski JS, Hostetter JM, Wang C, Jergens AE, Phillips GJ, Wannemuehler MJ",2021,Article,10.3389/fimmu.2020.585431,"The intestinal microbiota is a critical component of mucosal health as evidenced by the fact that alterations in the taxonomic composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. To better understand how the progression of inflammation impacts the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, we used culture independent taxonomic profiling to identify temporal changes in the cecal microbiota of C3Bir IL-10-/- mice concomitantly with the onset and progression of colitis. This analysis revealed that IL-10-/- mice displayed a biphasic progression in disease severity, as evidenced by histopathological scores and cytokine production. Beginning at 4 weeks of age, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-1α as well as chemokines including RANTES and MIP-1α were elevated in the serum of IL-10-/- mice. By 19 weeks of age, the mice developed clinical signs of disease as evidenced by weight loss, which was accompanied by a significant increase in serum levels of KC and IL-17. While the overall diversity of the microbiota of both wild type and IL-10-/- were similar in young mice, the latter failed to increase in complexity as the mice matured and experienced changes in abundance of specific bacterial taxa that are associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans. Collectively, these results reveal that there is a critical time in young mice between four to six weeks of age when inflammation and the associated immune responses adversely affect maturation of the microbiota. © Copyright © 2021 Overstreet, Ramer-Tait, Suchodolski, Hostetter, Wang, Jergens, Phillips and Wannemuehler.","colitis; cytokine response; dysbiosis; enterobacteriaceae; ibd; il-10; microbiome; temporal dynamic changes; cxcl1 chemokine; gamma interferon; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 6; rna 16s; serum amyloid a; tumor necrosis factor; xenobiotic agent; il10 protein, mouse; interleukin 10; age; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial flora; bacterial metabolism; biosynthesis; butyrivibrio; chlamydia muridarum; chronic inflammation; colitis; controlled study; cytokine production; disease exacerbation; disease severity; dna repair; dorea; enteritis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; escherichia; female; gene sequence; helicobacter hepaticus; histopathology; immune response; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; intestine injury; lactococcus; metabolite; microbial community; microbial diversity; mouse; nonhuman; oscillibacter; pseudomonas; rna sequence; roseburia; signal transduction; animal; cecum; immunology; inflammation; intestine flora; knockout mouse; microbiology; animals; cecum; colitis; female; gastrointestinal microbiome; inflammation; interleukin-10; mice; mice, knockout",No
Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 Ameliorates Neuroendocrine Alterations Associated with an Exaggerated Stress Response and Anhedonia in Obese Mice,"Agusti A, Moya-Pérez A, Campillo I, Montserrat-de la Paz S, Cerrudo V, Perez-Villalba A, Sanz Y",2018,Article,10.1007/s12035-017-0768-z,"Obesity, besides being a problem of metabolic dysfunction, constitutes a risk factor for psychological disorders. Experimental models of diet-induced obesity have revealed that obese animals are prone to anxious and depressive-like behaviors. The present study aimed to evaluate whether Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 could reverse the neurobehavioral consequences of obesity in a high-fat diet (HFD) fed mouse model via regulation of the gut–brain axis. Adult male wild-type C57BL-6 mice were fed a standard diet or HFD, supplemented with either placebo or the bifidobacterial strain for 13 weeks. Behavioral tests were performed, and immune and neuroendocrine parameters were analyzed including leptin and corticosterone and their receptors, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and neurotransmitters. We found that obese mice showed anhedonia (p < 0.050) indicative of a depressive-like behavior and an exaggerated hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA)-mediated stress response to acute physical (p < 0.001) and social stress (p < 0.050), but these alterations were ameliorated by B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 (p < 0.050). These behavioral effects were parallel to reductions of the obesity-associated hyperleptinemia (p < 0.001) and restoration of leptin signaling (p < 0.050), along with fat mass loss (p < 0.010). B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 administration also led to restoration of the obesity-induced reductions in adrenaline in the hypothalamus (p < 0.010), involved in the hypothalamic control of energy balance. Furthermore, the bifidobacterial strain reduced the obesity-induced upregulation of TLR2 protein or gene expression in the intestine (p < 0.010) and the hippocampus (p < 0.050) and restored the alterations of 5-HT levels in the hippocampus (p < 0.050), which could contribute to attenuating the obesity-associated depressive-like behavior (p < 0.050). In summary, the results indicate that B. pseudocatenulatum CECT 7765 could play a role in depressive behavior comorbid with obesity via regulation of endocrine and immune mediators of the gut–brain axis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","bifidobacterium; depression; microbiota; obesity; serotonin; stress; tlr2; corticosterone; epinephrine; leptin; neurotransmitter; toll like receptor 2; catecholamine; corticosterone; glucocorticoid receptor; leptin; leptin receptor; serotonin; toll like receptor 2; adult; anhedonia; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial strain; bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum; body weight gain; controlled study; depression; disease association; energy balance; fat mass; gene expression; hormone determination; hyperleptinemia; hypothalamus; hypothalamus hypophysis system; lipid diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; social stress; stress; tlr2 gene; upregulation; animal; anxiety; bifidobacterium; blood; c57bl mouse; feces; metabolism; microbiology; motor activity; mouse mutant; neuroendocrine system; obesity; physiological stress; physiology; adiposity; anhedonia; animals; anxiety; behavior, animal; bifidobacterium; catecholamines; corticosterone; depression; feces; leptin; male; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, obese; motor activity; neurosecretory systems; receptors, glucocorticoid; receptors, leptin; serotonin; stress, physiological; toll-like receptor 2; weight gain",No

Individual quality and phenology mediate the effect of radioactive contamination on body temperature in Chernobyl barn swallows,"Boratyński Z, Mousseau TA, Møller AP",2021,Article,10.1002/ece3.7742,"Anthropogenic stressors, such as radioactive contaminants released from the Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi accidents, deteriorate ecological and evolutionary processes, as evidence for damaging effects of radioactive contamination on wildlife is accumulating. Yet little is known about physiological traits of animals inhabiting contaminated areas, and how those are affected by individual quality and phenology. We investigated variation in body temperature of wild barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, exposed to radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine and Belarus. We tested whether exposure to variable levels of radioactive contamination modified core body temperature of birds, and whether individual and phenological characteristics modulated radiosensitivity of body temperature. We showed that barn swallow body temperature varied with exposure to environmental radioactive contamination and that individual characteristics and phenology affected radioactive exposure. Increased radiosensitivity and up-regulation of body temperature were detected in birds of low body condition, high risk of capture, and in animals captured late during the day but early during the season. These results highlight the complex ways that the body temperature of a wild bird is impacted by exposure to increased radioactive contamination in natural habitats. By impacting body temperature, increased radioactive contamination may compromise energetic balance, jeopardize responsiveness to global warming, and increase risk of overheating. © 2021 The Authors.

Host plant species determines symbiotic bacterial community mediating suppression of plant defenses,"Chung SH, Scully ED, Peiffer M, Geib SM, Rosa C, Hoover K, Felton GW",2017,Article,10.1038/srep39690,"Herbivore associated bacteria are vital mediators of plant and insect interactions. Host plants play an important role in shaping the gut bacterial community of insects. Colorado potato beetles (CPB; Leptinotarsa decemlineata) use several Solanum plants as hosts in their natural environment. We previously showed that symbiotic gut bacteria from CPB larvae suppressed jasmonate (JA)-induced defenses in tomato. However, little is known about how changes in the bacterial community may be involved in the manipulation of induced defenses in wild and cultivated Solanum plants of CPB. Here, we examined suppression of JA-mediated defense in wild and cultivated hosts of CPB by chemical elicitors and their symbiotic bacteria. Furthermore, we investigated associations between the gut bacterial community and suppression of plant defenses using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Symbiotic bacteria decreased plant defenses in all Solanum hosts and there were different gut bacterial communities in CPB fed on different host plants. When larvae were reared on different hosts, defense suppression differed among host plants. These results demonstrate that host plants influence herbivore gut bacterial communities and consequently affect the herbivore's ability to manipulate JA-mediated plant defenses. Thus, the presence of symbiotic bacteria that suppress plant defenses might help CPB adapt to host plants. © The Author(s) 2017.",; cyclopentane derivative; jasmonic acid; oxylipin; salicylic acid; animal; bacterial phenomena and functions; beetle; herbivory; intestine flora; larva; metabolism; microbiology; solanum; symbiosis; animals; bacterial physiological phenomena; coleoptera; cyclopentanes; gastrointestinal microbiome; herbivory; larva; oxylipins; salicylic acid; solanum; symbiosis,No
Egg lipid and thiamine vary between early and late spawning lake sturgeon,"Larson D, Scribner K, Dabrowski K, Lee B-J, Crossman J",2021,Article,10.1111/jai.14239,"Nutritional deficiency associated with reduced thiamine (vitamin B1) and reduced natural reproduction of salmonid species in the Great Lake Region is well established. The negative relationship between egg thiamine and lipid concentration to post-hatch larval growth and survival in teleost species, coupled with the limited research of egg thiamine in Acipenseriform species of conservation concern, including lake sturgeon, indicates that study of thiamine concentrations lake sturgeon eggs is warranted. Eggs were collected from females (N = 12) during the early and late portion of the spawning run in 2007 in a wild population from Black Lake, MI. Concentrations of thiamine, lipid and fatty acid concentration were measured along with female biological information (body size and egg size) and characteristics of larvae at hatch. Significant differences in egg thiamine concentrations were observed between early- and late-spawning females (mean ± SD: 2.36 nmol·g−1 ± 1.09 vs. 0.73 ± 0.25 nmol·g−1, W = 0.05, p &lt;.01). No significant relationships were observed between female body size or egg size and egg lipid or thiamine concentration. Differences in lipid and thiamine concentrations were not predictive of larval body size or yolk sac volume at hatch. Total and phosphorylated thiamine were correlated with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that dietary items were likely partially responsible for provisioning of essential compounds. Given the negative effects of low egg thiamine concentration on larval survival in other fish species globally, results indicate that further research in areas of nutrient acquisition and thiamine effects on larval survival, natural recruitment, and hatchery feeding strategies is warranted for lake sturgeon. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",; ,No

In this study, a water-soluble polysaccharide (MP) extracted from wild morels was evaluated for its effects on the gut microbiota of non-treated and cyclophosphamide (CP)-treated mice. The results showed that MP restored the spleen weight and increased the counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and spleen of the CP-treated mice. Mice treated with MP exhibited increased levels of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, especially Lachnospiraceae, compared to normal mice, and increased levels of Bacteroidetes and SCFA-producing bacteria, especially Ruminococcaceae, compared to the CP-treated mice. Moreover, MP treatment increased the production of valeric acid and decreased the production of acetic acid in the non-treated mice and increased the production of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid in the CP-treated mice.

GLP-1R agonists modulate enteric immune responses through the intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte GLP-1R,"Yusta B, Baggio LL, Koehler J, Holland D, Cao X, Pinnell LJ, Johnson-Henry KC, Yeung W, Surette MG, Bang KWA, Sherman PM, Drucker DJ",2015,Article,10.2337/db14-1577,"Obesity and diabetes are characterized by increased inflammation reflecting disordered control of innate immunity. We reveal a local intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL)-GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling network that controls mucosal immune responses. Glp1r expression was enriched in intestinal IEL preparations and copurified with markers of Tab and Tgd IELs, the two main subsets of intestinal IELs. Exendin-4 increased cAMP accumulation in purified IELs and reduced the production of cytokines from activated IELs but not from splenocytes ex vivo. These actions were mimicked by forskolin, absent in IELs from Glp1r2/2 mice, and attenuated by the GLP-1R agonist exendin (9-39) consistent with a GLP-1R-dependent mechanism of action. Furthermore, Glp1r2/2 mice exhibited dysregulated intestinal gene expression, an abnormal representation of microbial species in feces, and enhanced sensitivity to intestinal injury following administration of dextran sodium sulfate. Bone marrow transplantation using wild-type C57BL/6 donors normalized expression of multiple genes regulating immune function and epithelial integrity in Glp1r2/2 recipient mice, whereas acute exendin-4 administration robustly induced the expression of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines in normal and injured intestine.

Influence of Porphyromonas gingivalis in gut microbiota of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice,"Ohtsu A, Takeuchi Y, Katagiri S, Suda W, Maekawa S, Shiba T, Komazaki R, Udagawa S, Sasaki N, Hattori M, Izumi Y",2019,Article,10.1111/odi.13044,"Objectives: Increasing evidence suggests that periodontitis can exacerbate diabetes, and gut bacterial dysbiosis appears to be linked with the diabetic condition. The present study examined the effects of oral administration of the periodontopathic bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, on the gut microbiota and systemic conditions in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Materials and Methods: Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection in C57BL/6J male mice (STZ). STZ and wild-type (WT) mice were orally administered P. gingivalis (STZPg, WTPg) or saline (STZco, WTco). Feces were collected, and the gut microbiome was examined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The expression of genes related to inflammation, epithelial tight junctions, and glucose/fatty acid metabolism in the ileum or liver were examined by quantitative PCR. Results: The relative abundance of several genera, including Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, and Facklamia, was significantly increased in STZco mice compared to WTco mice. The relative abundances of Staphylococcus and Turicibacter in the gut microbiome were altered by oral administration of P. gingivalis in STZ mice. STZPg mice showed higher concentrations of fasting blood glucose and inflammatory genes levels in the ileum, compared to STZco mice.

Comparative analysis of the gut microbiota composition between captive and wild forest musk deer,"Li Y, Hu X, Yang S, Zhou J, Zhang T, Qi L, Sun X, Fan M, Xu S, Cha M, Zhang M, Lin S, Liu S, Hu D",2017,Article,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01705,"The large and complex gut microbiota in animals has profound effects on feed utilization and metabolism. Currently, gastrointestinal diseases due to dysregulated gut microbiota are considered important factors that limit growth of the captive forest musk deer population. Compared with captive forest musk deer, wild forest musk deer have a wider feeding range with no dietary limitations, and their gut microbiota are in a relatively natural state. However, no reports have compared the gut microbiota between wild and captive forest musk deer. To gain insight into the composition of gut microbiota in forest musk deer under different food-source conditions, we employed high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing technology to investigate differences in the gut microbiota occurring between captive and wild forest musk deer. Both captive and wild forest musk deer showed similar microbiota at the phylum level, which consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, although significant differences were found in their relative abundances between both groups. α-Diversity results showed that no significant differences occurred in the microbiota between both groups, while β-diversity results showed that significant differences did occur in their microbiota compositions.

Gut microbiota composition of Japanese macaques associates with extent of human encroachment,"Lee W, Hayakawa T, Kiyono M, Yamabata N, Hanya G",2019,Article,10.1002/ajp.23072,"In recent decades, human–wildlife interaction and associated anthropogenic food provisioning has been increasing and becoming more severe due to fast population growth and urban development. Noting the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology like nutrition and health, it is thus essential to understand how human–wildlife interactions and availability of anthropogenic food in habitats can affect an animal's gut microbiome. This study, therefore, set out to examine the gut microbiota of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with varying accessibility to anthropogenic food and the possibility of using gut microbiota as indicator for macaques’ reliance on anthropogenic food. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we described the microbial composition of Japanese macaques experiencing different types of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability—captive, provisioned, crop-raiding, and wild. In terms of alpha diversity, our results showed that observed richness of gut microbiota did not differ significantly between disturbance types but among collection sites, whereas Shannon diversity index differed by both disturbance types and sites. In terms of beta diversity, captive populations harbored the most distinctive gut microbial composition, and had the greatest difference compared with wild populations. Whereas for provisioned and crop-raiding groups, the macaques exhibited intermediate microbiota between wild and captive. We identified several potential bacterial taxa at different taxonomic ranks whose abundance potentially could help in assessing macaques’ accessibility to anthropogenic food.

Among the various sources and transmission routes identified, fertilisers of faecal origin, irrigation and surface water for plant-based food and water for aquaculture were considered of major importance. For terrestrial animal production, potential sources consist of feed, humans, water, air/dust, soil, wildlife, rodents, arthropods and equipment. Among those, evidence was found for introduction with feed and humans, for the other sources, the importance could not be assessed. Several ARB of highest priority for public health, such as carbapenem or extended-spectrum cephalosporin and/or fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacterales (including Salmonella enterica), fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis were identified. Among highest priority ARGs blaCTX-M, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-48-like, blaOXA-23, mcr, armA, vanA, cfr and optrA were reported. These highest priority bacteria and genes were identified in different sources, at primary and post-harvest level, particularly faeces/manure, soil and water. For all sectors, reducing the occurrence of faecal microbial contamination of fertilisers, water, feed and the production environment and minimising persistence/recycling of ARB within animal production facilities is a priority. Proper implementation of good hygiene practices, biosecurity and food safety management systems is very important. Potential AMR-specific interventions are in the early stages of development. Many data gaps relating to sources and relevance of transmission routes, diversity of ARB and ARGs, effectiveness of mitigation measures were identified. Representative epidemiological and attribution studies on AMR and its effective control in food production environments at EU level, linked to One Health and environmental initiatives, are urgently required. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

Structural and compositional mismatch between captive and wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parrs’ gut microbiota highlights the relevance of integrating molecular ecology for management and conservation methods,"Lavoie C, Courcelle M, Redivo B, Derome N",2018,Article,10.1111/eva.12658,"Stocking methods are used in the Province of Quebec to restore Salmo salar populations. However, Atlantic salmon stocked juveniles show higher mortality rates than wild ones when introduced into nature. Hatchery environment, which greatly differs from the natural environment, is identified as the main driver of the phenotypic mismatch between captive and wild parrs. The latter is also suspected to impact the gut microbiota composition, which can be associated with essential metabolic functions for their host. We hypothesized that hatchery-raised parrs potentially recruit gut microbial communities that are different from those recruited in the wild. This study evaluated the impacts of artificial rearing on gut microbiota composition in 0+ parrs meant for stocking in two distinct Canadian rivers: Rimouski and Malbaie (Quebec, Canada). Striking differences between hatchery and wild-born parrs’ gut microbiota suggest that microbiota could be another factor that could impact their survival in the targeted river, because the microbiome is narrowly related to host physiology. For instance, major commensals belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiacea from wild parrs’ gut microbiota were substituted in captive parrs by lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family. Overall, captive parrs host a generalist bacterial community whereas wild parrs’ microbiota is much more specialized. This is the very first study demonstrating extensive impact of captive rearing on intestinal microbiota composition in Atlantic salmon intended for wild population stocking. Our results strongly suggest the need to implement microbial ecology concepts into conservation management of endangered salmon stocks supplemented with hatchery-reared parrs. © 2018 The Authors.

Response to dietary carbohydrates in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) muscle tissue as revealed by NMR-based metabolomics,"Jarak I, Tavares L, Palma M, Rito J, Carvalho RA, Viegas I",2018,Article,10.1007/s11306-018-1390-4,"Introduction: Feed optimization is a key step to the environmental and economic sustainability of aquaculture, especially for carnivorous species. Plant-derived ingredients can contribute to reduce costs and nitrogenous effluents while sparing wild fish stocks. However, the metabolic use of carbohydrates from vegetable sources by carnivorous fish is still not completely understood. Objectives: We aimed to study the effects of diets with carbohydrates of different digestibilities, gelatinized starch (DS) and raw starch (RS), in the muscle metabolome of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Methods: We followed an NMR-metabolomics approach, using two sample preparation procedures, the intact muscle (HRMAS) and the aqueous muscle extracts ( 1 H NMR), to compare the variations in muscle metabolome between the two diets. Results: In muscle, multivariate analysis revealed similar metabolome shifts for DS and RS diets, when compared with the control diet. HRMAS of intact muscle, which included both hydrophobic and hydrophilic metabolites, showed increased lipid in DS-fed fish by univariate analysis. Regardless of the nature of the starch, increased glycine and phenylalanine, and decreased proline were observed when compared to the Ctr diet. Combined univariate analysis of intact muscle and aqueous extracts indicated specific diet related changes in lipid and amino acid metabolism, consistent with increased dietary carbohydrate supplementation. Conclusions: Due to differential sample processing, outputs differ in detail but provide complementary information. After tracing nutritional alterations by profiling fillet components, DS seems to be the most promising alternative to fishmeal-based diets in aquaculture. This approach should be reproducible for other farmed fish species and provide valuable information on nutritional and organoleptic properties of the final product. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",aquaculture; diet optimization; digestible starch; fish; metabolism; tissue extracts; starch; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal model; aquaculture; article; bioavailability; carbohydrate diet; controlled study; digestion; european sea bass; fish; growth rate; lipid metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; muscle tissue; nonhuman; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; swimming; animal; bass; carbohydrate diet; metabolism; muscle; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; animals; bass; dietary carbohydrates; metabolomics; muscles; proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy,No
Do host-associated gut microbiota mediate the effect of an herbicide on disease risk in frogs?,"Knutie SA, Gabor CR, Kohl KD, Rohr JR",2018,Article,10.1111/1365-2656.12769,"Environmental stressors, such as pollutants, can increase disease risk in wildlife. For example, the herbicide atrazine affects host defences (e.g. resistance and tolerance) of the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), but the mechanisms for these associations are not entirely clear. Given that pollutants can alter the gut microbiota of hosts, which in turn can affect their health and immune systems, one potential mechanism by which pollutants could increase infection risk is by influencing host-associated microbiota. Here, we test whether early-life exposure to the estimated environmental concentration (EEC; 200 μg/L) of atrazine affects the gut bacterial composition of Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) tadpoles and adults and whether any atrazine-induced change in community composition might affect host defences against Bd. We also determine whether early-life changes in the stress hormone corticosterone affect gut microbiota by experimentally inhibiting corticosterone synthesis with metyrapone. With the exception of changing the relative abundances of two bacterial genera in adulthood, atrazine did not affect gut bacterial diversity or community composition of tadpoles (in vivo or in vitro) or adults. Metyrapone did not significantly affect bacterial diversity of tadpoles, but significantly increased bacterial diversity of adults. Gut bacterial diversity during Bd exposure did not predict host tolerance or resistance to Bd intensity in tadpoles or adults. However, early-life bacterial diversity negatively predicted Bd intensity as adult frogs. Specifically, Bd intensity as adults was associated negatively with the relative abundance of phylum Fusobacteria in the guts of tadpoles. Our results suggest that the effect of atrazine on Bd infection risk is not mediated by host-associated microbiota because atrazine does not affect microbiota of tadpoles or adults. However, host-associated microbes seem important in host resistance to Bd because the early-life microbiota, during immune system development, predicted later-life infection risk with Bd. Overall, our study suggests that increasing gut bacterial diversity and relative abundances of Fusobacteria might have lasting positive effects on amphibian health. © 2017 The Authors.

Arabidopsis thaliana and Pseudomonas Pathogens Exhibit Stable Associations over Evolutionary Timescales,"Karasov TL, Almario J, Friedemann C, Ding W, Giolai M, Heavens D, Kersten S, Lundberg DS, Neumann M, Regalado J, Neher RA, Kemen E, Weigel D",2018,Article,10.1016/j.chom.2018.06.011,"Disease outbreaks in agriculture are often associated with clonal expansions of single pathogenic lineages. In this study, Karasov et al. show that in populations of a wild plant, no single lineage of an abundant pathogen takes over the host population. Genetic and species diversity may prevent clonal expansions in nature.Crop disease outbreaks are often associated with clonal expansions of single pathogenic lineages. To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild pathosystems, we carried out a multi-year, multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in its natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. The most common Pseudomonas lineage corresponded to a ubiquitous pathogenic clade. Sequencing of 1,524 genomes revealed this lineage to have diversified approximately 300,000 years ago, containing dozens of genetically identifiable pathogenic sublineages. There is differentiation at the level of both gene content and disease phenotype, although the differentiation may not provide fitness advantages to specific sublineages. The coexistence of sublineages indicates that in contrast to crop systems, no single strain has been able to overtake the studied A. thaliana populations in the recent past.

Diet Versus Phylogeny: a Comparison of Gut Microbiota in Captive Colobine Monkey Species,"Hale VL, Tan CL, Niu K, Yang Y, Knight R, Zhang Q, Cui D, Amato KR",2018,Article,10.1007/s00248-017-1041-8,"Both diet and host phylogeny shape the gut microbial community, and separating out the effects of these variables can be challenging. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to evaluate the impact of diet and phylogeny on the gut microbiota of nine colobine monkey species (N = 64 individuals). Colobines are leaf-eating monkeys that fare poorly in captivity—often exhibiting gastrointestinal (GI) problems. This study included eight Asian colobines (Rhinopithecus brelichi, Rhinopithecus roxellana, Rhinopithecus bieti, Pygathrix nemaeus, Nasalis larvatus, Trachypithecus francoisi, Trachypithecus auratus, and Trachypithecus vetulus) and one African colobine (Colobus guereza). Monkeys were housed at five different captive institutes: Panxi Wildlife Rescue Center (Guizhou, China), Beijing Zoo, Beijing Zoo Breeding Center, Singapore Zoo, and Singapore Zoo Primate Conservation Breeding Center. Captive diets varied widely between institutions, but within an institution, all colobine monkey species were fed nearly identical or identical diets. In addition, four monkey species were present at multiple captive institutes. This allowed us to parse the effects of diet and phylogeny in these captive colobines. Gut microbial communities clustered weakly by host species and strongly by diet, and overall, colobine phylogenetic relationships were not reflected in gut microbiota analyses. Core microbiota analyses also identified several key taxa—including microbes within the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families—that were shared by over 90% of the monkeys in this study. Microbial species within these families include many butyrate producers that are important for GI health.

Detection of neopterin in the urine of captive and wild platyrrhines,"Sacco AJ, Mayhew JA, Watsa M, Erkenswick G, Binder AK",2020,Article,10.1186/s40850-020-00051-9,"Background: Non-invasive biomarkers can facilitate health assessments in wild primate populations by reducing the need for direct access to animals. Neopterin is a biomarker that is a product of the cell-mediated immune response, with high levels being indicative of poor survival expectations in some cases. The measurement of urinary neopterin concentration (UNC) has been validated as a method for monitoring cell-mediated immune system activation in multiple catarrhine species, but to date there is no study testing its utility in the urine of platyrrhine species. In this study, we collected urine samples across three platyrrhine families including small captive populations of Leontopithecus rosalia and Pithecia pithecia, and larger wild populations of Leontocebus weddelli, Saguinus imperator, Alouatta seniculus, and Plecturocebus toppini, to evaluate a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of urinary neopterin in platyrrhines. Results: Our results revealed measured UNC fell within the sensitivity range of the assay in all urine samples collected from captive and wild platyrrhine study species via commercial ELISA, and results from several dilutions met expectations. We found significant differences in the mean UNC across all study species. Most notably, we observed higher UNC in the wild population of L. weddelli which is known to have two filarial nematode infections compared to S. imperator, which only have one. Conclusion: Our study confirms that neopterin is measurable via commercial ELISA in urine collected from captive and wild individuals of six genera of platyrrhines across three different families. These findings promote the future utility of UNC as a promising biomarker for field primatologists conducting research in Latin America to non-invasively evaluate cell-mediated immune system activation from urine. © 2020 The Author(s).",biomarker; health monitoring; immune function; neopterin; platyrrhines; ,No
Inulin Fermentable Fiber Ameliorates Type I Diabetes via IL22 and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Experimental Models,"Zou J, Reddivari L, Shi Z, Li S, Wang Y, Bretin A, Ngo VL, Flythe M, Pellizzon M, Chassaing B, Gewirtz AT",2021,Article,10.1016/j.jcmgh.2021.04.014,"Background & Aims: Nourishment of gut microbiota via consumption of fermentable fiber promotes gut health and guards against metabolic syndrome. In contrast, how dietary fiber impacts type 1 diabetes is less clear. Methods: To examine impact of dietary fibers on development of type 1 diabetes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous non-obese diabetes (NOD) models, mice were fed grain-based chow (GBC) or compositionally defined diets enriched with a fermentable fiber (inulin) or an insoluble fiber (cellulose). Spontaneous (NOD mice) or STZ-induced (wild-type mice) diabetes was monitored. Results: Relative to GBC, low-fiber diets exacerbated STZ-induced diabetes, whereas diets enriched with inulin, but not cellulose, strongly protected against or treated it. Inulin's restoration of glycemic control prevented loss of adipose depots, while reducing food and water consumption. Inulin normalized pancreatic function and markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity. Such amelioration of diabetes was associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition and was eliminated by antibiotic administration. Pharmacologic blockade of fermentation reduced inulin's beneficial impact on glycemic control, indicating a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Furthermore, inulin's microbiota-dependent anti-diabetic effect associated with SCFA-independent restoration of interleukin 22, which was necessary and sufficient to ameliorate STZ-induced diabetes. Inulin-enriched diets significantly delayed diabetes in NOD mice. Conclusions: Fermentable fiber confers microbiota-dependent increases in SCFA and interleukin 22 that, together, may have potential to prevent and/or treat type 1 diabetes. © 2021 The Authors",cellulose; gut microbiota; insulin resistance; inulin; type 1 diabetes; ,No

A number of studies have shown that different bacterial species modulate the intestinal CD4(+) T cell compartment in different ways. We performed mechanistic in vivo studies that demonstrated the crucial requirement for regulatory T cells (Treg) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the induction of intestinal T cell homeostasis even following colonization with a completely benign microbiota. In the absence of a functional Treg response or IL-10 receptor signaling, the same bacteria that induced a Treg response in wild-type animals now induced T helper type 17 responses, without intestinal inflammation. Therefore, Treg, IL-10 and Th17 are crucial regulatory mechanisms in the intestine not only for controlling inflammation, but also to establish a continuum of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis upon commensal colonization.","; il10 protein, mouse; interleukin 10; adaptation; animal; article; bacteroides; cellular immunity; disease model; enteritis; germfree animal; growth, development and aging; homeostasis; immunology; intestine; lactobacillus; metagenome; microbiology; mouse; mucosal immunity; regulatory t lymphocyte; symbiosis; th17 cell; adaptation, physiological; animals; bacteroides; disease models, animal; homeostasis; immunity, cellular; immunity, mucosal; inflammatory bowel diseases; interleukin-10; intestines; lactobacillus; metagenome; mice; specific pathogen-free organisms; symbiosis; t-lymphocytes, regulatory; th17 cells",No
Fifty years of European ungulate dietary studies: a synthesis,"Spitzer R, Felton A, Landman M, Singh NJ, Widemo F, Cromsigt JPGM",2020,Article,10.1111/oik.07435,"Over recent decades, ungulate populations across Europe have undergone a rapid recovery. While this constitutes a conservation success, there is increasing concern about their impacts on shared resources with humans. Understanding ungulate food choices is crucial for predicting such impacts. Numerous studies have focused on single species or communities at narrow spatial scales. Here, we used 265 published diets from 87 European studies to investigate patterns of resource use by four common deer species (moose Alces alces, red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and fallow deer Dama dama), and wild boar Sus scrofa at the continental scale. On average, deer diets separated mostly along a gradient from grass to browse. Fallow deer diets contained the most and moose diets the least amount of grass, but we also found large intraspecific variation among all deer species. Diets of roe deer, a presumed browser, frequently contained ≥ 25% grass. Wild boar diet contained grass in amounts similar to red deer but otherwise differed strongly from deer diets. All five ungulate species shifted to eating higher proportions of woody browse during winter. Habitat influenced variation in intraspecific diets, but the proportions of key forage types related to feeding type (i.e. grass for intermediate feeders red and fallow deer, and shrubs for the browsers moose and roe deer) remained fairly consisted across habitat types. In northern and central Europe, diet similarity between roe deer and red deer was highest during winter and spring and lowest during summer and autumn but remained constant across the seasons in southern Europe. We foresee that, as interspecific interactions driven by land-use and climatic changes increase across Europe, further monitoring and testing will be needed to understand the dynamics of dietary niche partitioning among ungulates. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

Hydrogen metabolism in Helicobacter pylori plays a role in gastric carcinogenesis through facilitating CagA translocation,"Wang G, Romero-Gallo J, Benoit SL, Blanca Piazuelo M, Dominguez RL, Morgan DR, Peek RM, Jr, Maier RJ",2016,Article,10.1128/mBio.01022-16,"A known virulence factor of Helicobacter pylori that augments gastric cancer risk is the CagA cytotoxin. A carcinogenic derivative strain, 7.13, that has a greater ability to translocate CagA exhibits much higher hydrogenase activity than its parent noncarcinogenic strain, B128. A Δhyd mutant strain with deletion of hydrogenase genes was ineffective in CagA translocation into human gastric epithelial AGS cells, while no significant attenuation of cell adhesion was observed. The quinone reductase inhibitor 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO) was used to specifically inhibit the H2-utilizing respiratory chain of outer membrane-permeabilized bacterial cells; that level of inhibitor also greatly attenuated CagA translocation into AGS cells, indicating the H2-generated transmembrane potential is a contributor to toxin translocation. The Δhyd strain showed a decreased frequency of DNA transformation, suggesting that H. pylori hydrogenase is also involved in energizing the DNA uptake apparatus. In a gerbil model of infection, the ability of the Δhyd strain to induce inflammation was significantly attenuated (at 12 weeks postinoculation), while all of the gerbils infected with the parent strain (7.13) exhibited a high level of inflammation. Gastric cancer developed in 50% of gerbils infected with the wild-type strain 7.13 but in none of the animals infected with the Δhyd strain. By examining the hydrogenase activities from well-defined clinical H. pylori isolates, we observed that strains isolated from cancer patients (n=6) have a significantly higher hydrogenase (H2/O2) activity than the strains isolated from gastritis patients (n=6), further supporting an association between H. pylori hydrogenase activity and gastric carcinogenesis in humans. IMPORTANCE Hydrogen-utilizing hydrogenases are known to be important for some respiratory pathogens to colonize hosts. Here a gastric cancer connection is made via a pathogen’s (H. pylori) use of molecular hydrogen, a host microbiome-produced gas. Delivery of the known carcinogenic factor CagA into host cells is augmented by the H2-utilizing respiratory chain of the bacterium. The role of hydrogenase in carcinogenesis is demonstrated in an animal model, whereby inflammation markers and cancer development were attenuated in the hydrogenase-null strain. Hydrogenase activity comparisons of clinical strains of the pathogen also support a connection between hydrogen metabolism and gastric cancer risk. While molecular hydrogen use is acknowledged to be an alternative high-energy substrate for some pathogens, this work extends the roles of H2 oxidation to include transport of a carcinogenic toxin. The work provides a new avenue for exploratory treatment of some cancers via microflora alterations. © 2016 Strugeon et al.","; 2 heptyl 4 hydroxyquinoline 1 oxide; bacterial dna; caga protein; hydrogen; hydrogenase; bacterial antigen; bacterial protein; caga protein, helicobacter pylori; hydrogen; hydrogenase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial cell; bacterial outer membrane; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; cell adhesion; cell membrane potential; controlled study; enzyme activity; gene deletion; gerbil; helicobacter pylori; human; human cell; hyd gene; hydrogen metabolism; inflammation; male; metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; protein transport; respiratory chain; stomach cancer; stomach carcinogenesis; animal; carcinogenesis; cell line; cell transformation; disease model; enzymology; epithelium cell; genetics; helicobacter infection; helicobacter pylori; microbiology; pathogenicity; pathology; protein transport; animals; antigens, bacterial; bacterial proteins; carcinogenesis; cell line; cell transformation, neoplastic; disease models, animal; epithelial cells; gene deletion; gerbillinae; helicobacter infections; helicobacter pylori; humans; hydrogen; hydrogenase; protein transport",No

From protein damage to cell aging to population fitness in E. coli: Insights from a multi-level agent-based model,"Koleva KZ, Hellweger FL",2015,Article,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.01.024,"Aging is an important process affecting many organisms, including bacteria that appear to divide symmetrically. Recent research has established much of the mechanisms underlying aging in Escherichia coli, including the role of damaged protein aggregates (DPAs) that are transported by diffusion within the nucleoid-free intracellular space, which leads to their polar localization and asymmetric inheritance (i.e. aging). This provides an opportunity to develop a mechanistic model of E. coli and use it to assess the role of this process at the population level. Is there a fitness benefit to asymmetric inheritance of DPAs? Here we explore this question using a multi-level agent-based model, which simulates a population of individual cells, each with a population of individual DPAs. The model is compared to relevant data compiled from four published studies, which shows it reproduces the main patterns observed, including intracellular localization and inheritance of DPAs, their effect on growth rate, differences in growth rate between sibling pairs, under unstressed and heat shock conditions, for wild type and a mutant that partitions DPAs symmetrically. The model is used to estimate population growth rates of the wildtype and mutant, which shows a statistically significant benefit of aging by asymmetric DPA segregation. However, the benefit is very small and probably not relevant in the context of the ecology of the bacteria's primary habitat (the intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals). But, at an evolutionary time scale even this small benefit may be relevant for bacteria with large population sizes and short generation times. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",agent-based model; aging; bacteria; fitness; protein damage; aging of materials; bacteria; computational methods; ecology; escherichia coli; growth rate; health; plants (botany); proteins; agent-based model; fitness; intracellular localization; intracellular spaces; mechanistic modeling; population growth rates; protein damage; warm-blooded animals; population statistics; asymmetry; fitness; germ cell; microbial activity; mutation; protein; timescale; animalia; escherichia coli,No

However, the composition of the natural S. aureus population in wild and laboratory rats is largely unknown. Here, 144 nasal S. aureus isolates from free-living wild rats, captive wild rats and laboratory rats were genotyped and profiled for antibiotic resistances and human-specific virulence genes. The nasal S. aureus carriage rate was higher among wild rats (23.4%) than laboratory rats (12.3%). Freeliving wild rats were primarily colonized with isolates of clonal complex (CC) 49 and CC130 and maintained these strains even in husbandry. Moreover, upon livestock contact, CC398 isolates were acquired. In contrast, laboratory rats were colonized with many different S. aureus lineages-many of which are commonly found in humans. Five captive wild rats were colonized with CC398-MRSA. Moreover, a single CC30-MRSA and two CC130-MRSA were detected in free-living or captive wild rats.

Expression of the Blood-Group-Related Gene B4galnt2 Alters Susceptibility to Salmonella Infection,"Rausch P, Steck N, Suwandi A, Seidel JA, Künzel S, Bhullar K, Basic M, Bleich A, Johnsen JM, Vallance BA, Baines JF, Grassl GA",2015,Article,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005008,"Glycans play important roles in host-microbe interactions. Tissue-specific expression patterns of the blood group glycosyltransferase β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B4galnt2) are variable in wild mouse populations, and loss of B4galnt2 expression is associated with altered intestinal microbiota. We hypothesized that variation in B4galnt2 expression alters susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. To test this, we challenged mice genetically engineered to express different B4galnt2 tissue-specific patterns with a Salmonella Typhimurium infection model. We found B4galnt2 intestinal expression was strongly associated with bacterial community composition and increased Salmonella susceptibility as evidenced by increased intestinal inflammatory cytokines and infiltrating immune cells. Fecal transfer experiments demonstrated a crucial role of the B4galnt2-dependent microbiota in conferring susceptibility to intestinal inflammation, while epithelial B4galnt2 expression facilitated epithelial invasion of S. Typhimurium. These data support a critical role for B4galnt2 in gastrointestinal infections. We speculate that B4galnt2-specific differences in host susceptibility to intestinal pathogens underlie the strong signatures of balancing selection observed at the B4galnt2 locus in wild mouse populations. © 2015 Rausch et al.","; beta 1,4 n acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2; gamma interferon; glycan; glycosyltransferase; interleukin 6; lectin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; mucin 2; myeloperoxidase; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; rna 16s; small interfering rna; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; beta-1,4-n-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 2; n acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; animal cell; animal tissue; article; bacterial colonization; bacterial gene; cell infiltration; cell invasion; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dna extraction; enteritis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gastrointestinal infection; gene expression; gene frequency; gene sequence; histopathology; host susceptibility; immunohistochemistry; infection sensitivity; microbial community; microbial diversity; mouse; nonhuman; organismal interaction; phylogeny; population abundance; real time polymerase chain reaction; salmonellosis; sequence analysis; animal; animal salmonellosis; biosynthesis; c57bl mouse; genetic predisposition; genetic transfection; genetics; host parasite interaction; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; microbiology; physiology; salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium; transgenic mouse; bacteria (microorganisms); mus; salmonella; salmonella typhimurium; animals; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; gastrointestinal microbiome; genetic predisposition to disease; host-parasite interactions; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization, fluorescence; intestinal mucosa; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, transgenic; n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases; real-time polymerase chain reaction; salmonella infections, animal; salmonella typhimurium; transfection",No
Gene Sets for Utilization of Primary and Secondary Nutrition Supplies in the Distal Gut of Endangered Iberian Lynx,"Alcaide M, Messina E, Richter M, Bargiela R, Peplies J, Huws SA, Newbold CJ, Golyshin PN, Simón MA, López G, Yakimov MM, Ferrer M",2012,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0051521,"Recent studies have indicated the existence of an extensive trans-genomic trans-mural co-metabolism between gut microbes and animal hosts that is diet-, host phylogeny- and provenance-influenced. Here, we analyzed the biodiversity at the level of small subunit rRNA gene sequence and the metabolic composition of 18 Mbp of consensus metagenome sequences and activity characteristics of bacterial intra-cellular extracts, in wild Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) fecal samples. Bacterial signatures (14.43% of all of the Firmicutes reads and 6.36% of total reads) related to the uncultured anaerobic commensals Anaeroplasma spp., which are typically found in ovine and bovine rumen, were first identified. The lynx gut was further characterized by an over-representation of 'presumptive' aquaporin aqpZ genes and genes encoding 'active' lysosomal-like digestive enzymes that are possibly needed to acquire glycerol, sugars and amino acids from glycoproteins, glyco(amino)lipids, glyco(amino)glycans and nucleoside diphosphate sugars. Lynx gut was highly enriched (28% of the total glycosidases) in genes encoding α-amylase and related enzymes, although it exhibited low rate of enzymatic activity indicative of starch degradation. The preponderance of β-xylosidase activity in protein extracts further suggests lynx gut microbes being most active for the metabolism of β-xylose containing plant N-glycans, although β-xylosidases sequences constituted only 1.5% of total glycosidases. These collective and unique bacterial, genetic and enzymatic activity signatures suggest that the wild lynx gut microbiota not only harbors gene sets underpinning sugar uptake from primary animal tissues (with the monotypic dietary profile of the wild lynx consisting of 80-100% wild rabbits) but also for the hydrolysis of prey-derived plant biomass. Although, the present investigation corresponds to a single sample and some of the statements should be considered qualitative, the data most likely suggests a tighter, more coordinated and complex evolutionary and nutritional ecology scenario of carnivore gut microbial communities than has been previously assumed. © 2012 Alcaide et al.","; amino acid; amylase; carbohydrate; dna; glycerol; glycoaminolipid; glycoprotein; glycosaminoglycan; glycosidase; lipid; nucleoside diphosphate sugar; small subunit ribosomal rna; starch; unclassified drug; xylan 1,4 beta xylosidase; adult animal; anaeroplasma; animal tissue; aqpz gene; article; biomass; carbohydrate metabolism; digestion; endangered species; enzyme activity; feces analysis; firmicutes; gene; gene expression; hydrolysis; iberian lynx; intestine flora; lynx; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; rna gene; rna sequence; sequence analysis; small subunit rrna gene; wild species; animals; animals, wild; bacteria; endangered species; feeding behavior; gastrointestinal tract; genes, bacterial; genetic variation; lynx; spain; anaeroplasma; animalia; bacteria (microorganisms); bovinae; firmicutes; lynx; lynx pardinus; oryctolagus cuniculus; ovis",No
Inhibition of TLR4 signaling prolongs Treg-dependent murine islet allograft survival,"Zhang N, Krüger B, Lal G, Luan Y, Yadav A, Zang W, Grimm M, Waaga-Gasser AM, Murphy B, Bromberg JS, Schröppel B",2010,Article,10.1016/j.imlet.2009.10.004,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide an important link between innate and adaptive immune system. We hypothesized that the recognition of endogenous TLR4 ligands is occurring at the time of transplantation, and these innate signals drive the inflammation and affect alloimmune responses. We confirmed that early after transplantation of allogenic islets, transcripts for TLR4 as well as potential ligands were released or up-regulated. In an allogenic islet transplantation model, genetic disruption of TLR4 on donor islets had no effect on allograft survival, whereas TLR4 deficiency in recipients lead to prolonged graft survival. Low dose rapamycin-treatment of TLR4-/- recipients induced permanent engraftment of 45% islet graft (p = 0.005) compared to WT recipients. This prolonged graft survival was dependent on the presence of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg. Naïve CD4+CD25- T cells cultured with the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide showed enhanced IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IFNγ secretion and inhibited TGFβ induced Foxp3+Treg generation.

Comparative Analysis of Microbial Community Structure and Function in the Gut of Wild and Captive Amur Tiger,"Ning Y, Qi J, Dobbins MT, Liang X, Wang J, Chen S, Ma J, Jiang G",2020,Article,10.3389/fmicb.2020.01665,"It has been well acknowledged that the gut microbiome is important for host health, composition changes in these microbial communities might increase susceptibility to infections and reduce adaptability to environment. Reintroduction, as an effective strategy for wild population recovery and genetic diversity maintenance for endangered populations, usually takes captive populations as rewilding resource. While, little is known about the compositional and functional differences of gut microbiota between captive and wild populations, especially for large carnivores, like Amur tiger. In this study, high throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (amplicon sequencing) and metagenomics were used to analyze the composition and function variations of gut microbiota communities between captive and wild Amur tiger populations based on total 35 fecal samples (13 from captive tigers and 22 from wild tigers). Our results showed that captive Amur tigers have higher alpha diversity in gut microbiota, but that the average unweighted UniFrac distance of bacterial taxa among wild Amur tigers was much larger. The function differences involve most aspects of the body functions, especially for metabolism, environmental information processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems. It was indicated that the diet habit and environment difference between captive and wild populations lead to composition differences of gut microbiota and then resulted in significant differences in functions. These contrasts of functional and compositional variations in gut microbiota between wild and captive Amur tigers are essential insights for guiding conservation management and policy decision-making, and call for more attention on the influence of gut microbiota on the ability of captive animals to survive in the wild. © Copyright © 2020 Ning, Qi, Dobbins, Liang, Wang, Chen, Ma and Jiang.",16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing; amur tiger; conservation management; core microbiome; metagenome sequencing; carbohydrate binding protein; esterase; glycosidase; rna 16s; actinobacteria; agar gel electrophoresis; amur tiger; article; bacteroidetes; bioinformatics; community structure; comparative study; controlled study; dna extraction; feces analysis; firmicutes; high throughput sequencing; intestine flora; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial kinetics; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; proteobacteria; taxonomy; tiger,Yes
"Lipid-Lowering Effects of Lotus Leaf Alcoholic Extract on Serum, Hepatopancreas, and Muscle of Juvenile Grass Carp via Gene Expression","Yao J, Hu P, Zhu Y, Xu Y, Tan Q, Liang X",2020,Article,10.3389/fphys.2020.584782,"Compared with wild grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), intensively cultured fish displayed disordered lipid metabolism, showing excess lipid deposition in the hepatopancreas and muscle. Lotus leaf prevents fat accumulation in humans and may have similar effects on fish. This study explored the regulatory mechanisms by which the dietary addition of an alcoholic extract of lotus leaf (AELL) reduced lipid deposition in the hepatopancreas and muscle of juvenile grass carp. The fish (average initial weight: 34.00 ± 0.40 g) were fed four experimental diets containing different AELL levels (0, 0.07, 0.14, and 0.21%) for 8 weeks. Serum components, lipid droplet size, triacylglycerol (TAG) content, enzymatic activities, and mRNA levels of genes related to lipid metabolism in the hepatopancreas and muscle were analyzed. The results show that dietary AELL supplementation significantly reduced the TAG content and lipid droplet area in the histological sections as well as the fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity in both the hepatopancreas and muscle but enhanced the activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) in both tissues. In addition, dietary AELL supplementation decreased the mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake (cd36, fatp1/fatp4/fatp6, fabp10/fabp11, acsl1/acsl4) and de novo lipid synthesis (pgd, g6pd, and fasn) as well as the transcription factors pparg and srebf1 in the hepatopancreas and muscle but increased the mRNA levels of genes relating to lipid catabolism (cpt1a, lipe, pnpla2, lpl), lipid transportation (apob), and the transcription factor ppara in both tissues. In conclusion, dietary AELL supplementation reduced lipid accumulation in the hepatopancreas and muscle by affecting the gene expression of proteins with known effects on lipid metabolism in juvenile grass carp. © Copyright © 2020 Yao, Hu, Zhu, Xu, Tan and Liang.",ctenopharyngodon idellus; lipid catabolism; lipid transportation; lipogenesis; molecular pathway; plant extract; alcohol; antilipemic agent; carnitine palmitoyltransferase i; fat droplet; fatty acid synthase; lipoprotein lipase; lotus extract; messenger rna; plant extract; transcription factor; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; acsl1 gene; acsl4 gene; animal experiment; animal tissue; apob gene; article; cd36 gene; controlled study; cpt1a gene; diet supplementation; dietary intake; drug effect; enzyme activity; experimental diet; fabp10 gene; fabp11 gene; fasn gene; fatp1 gene; fatp4 gene; fatp6 gene; fatty acid transport; g6pd gene; gene expression; gene function; grass carp; hepatopancreas; histology; juvenile animal; lipe gene; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipid transport; lipogenesis; lipolysis; lotus (genus); lpl gene; muscle tissue; nonhuman; pgd gene; plant leaf; pnpla2 gene; pparg gene; regulatory mechanism; serum; srebf1 gene; tissue section; treatment duration,No
Porphyromonas gingivalis Induces Insulin Resistance by Increasing BCAA Levels in Mice,"Tian J, Liu C, Zheng X, Jia X, Peng X, Yang R, Zhou X, Xu X",2020,Article,10.1177/0022034520911037,"Insulin resistance is one of the critical pathogeneses of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Elevated levels of plasma branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with insulin resistance. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the development of insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms by which P. gingivalis induces insulin resistance are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether P. gingivalis induces insulin resistance through BCAA biosynthesis. We established a murine model of periodontitis by infecting mice with P. gingivalis. Alveolar bone loss, insulin sensitivity, and the plasma level of BCAAs were measured. A P. gingivalis BCAA aminotransferase-deficient strain (∆bcat) was constructed, and its kinetic growth, biofilm formation, and in vivo colonization were compared with its wild-type strain. Alveolar bone loss, insulin sensitivity, and the plasma level of BCAAs of the mice infected with either wild-type strain or ∆bcat strain were further measured. We found that periodontal infection with P. gingivalis significantly upregulated the plasma level of BCAAs and aggravated the high-fat diet (HFD)–induced insulin resistance. Bcat deletion did not alter the growth, biofilm formation, and in vivo colonization of P. gingivalis. More important, the ∆bcat strain was unable to upregulate the plasma level of BCAAs and induce insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. These findings suggest that the BCAA biosynthesis of P. gingivalis plays a critical role in the development of insulin resistance in the HFD-fed mice. The BCAA biosynthesis pathways may provide a potential target for the disruption of linkage between periodontitis and T2DM. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2020.","alveolar bone loss; blood glucose; branched-chain amino acids; diabetes mellitus; high-fat diet; periodontitis; branched chain amino acid; insulin; adverse event; animal; insulin resistance; lipid diet; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; porphyromonas gingivalis; amino acids, branched-chain; animals; diabetes mellitus, type 2; diet, high-fat; insulin; insulin resistance; mice; porphyromonas gingivalis",No
Functional genomic studies of the intestinal response to a foodborne enteropathogen in a humanized gnotobiotic mouse model,"Lecuit M, Sonnenburg JL, Cossart P, Gordon JI",2007,Article,10.1074/jbc.M610926200,"Members of the genus Listeria provide a model for defining host responses to invasive foodborne enteropathogens. Active translocation of Listeria monocytogenes across the gut epithelial barrier is mediated by interaction of bacterial internalin (InlA) and its species-specific host receptor, E-cadherin, whereas translocation across Peyer's patches through M-cells is InlA-independent. To define microbial determinants and molecular correlates of the host response to translocation via these two routes, we colonized germ-free transgenic mice expressing the human enterocyte-associated E-cadherin receptor with wildtype (WT) or mutant L. monocytogenes strains, or its nonpathogenic noninvasive relative Listeria innocua, or with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent gut symbiont. Mouse Gene-Chips, combined with Ingenuity Pathway software, were used to identify canonical signaling pathways that comprise the response to WT L. monocytogenes versus the other species. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments with L. innocua and L. monocytogenes, respectively, demonstrated that the 773-member transcriptional signature of the response to WT L. monocytogenes is largely conserved in the ΔinlA mutant. Internalin-dependent responses include down-regulation of gene networks involved in various aspects of lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism and up-regulation of immunoinflammatory responses. The host response is markedly attenuated in a listeriolysin-deficient (Δhly) mutant despite its ability to be translocated to the lamina propria. Together, these studies establish that hly, rather than bacterial invasion of the lamina propria mediated by InlA, is a dominant determinant of the intensity of the host response to L. monocytogenes infection via the oral route. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","; energy metabolism; foodborne enteropathogen; gut epithelial barrier; humanized gnotobiotic mouse model; immunoinflammatory responses; intestinal response; listeria; monocytogenes; species-specific host receptor; translocation; amino acids; functional analysis; gene expression; lipids; mutagenesis; pathogens; genetic engineering; bacterial protein; internalin; listeriolysin; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; bacterial protein; cadherin; internalin protein, bacteria; amino acid metabolism; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium mutant; bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; computer program; controlled study; down regulation; energy metabolism; food contamination; functional genomics; genetic transcription; gnotobiotics; immune response; inflammation; intestine; intestine cell; lamina propria; lipid metabolism; listeria innocua; listeria monocytogenes; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; signal transduction; transgenic mouse; upregulation; wild type; animal; bacterial translocation; bacteroides; disease model; dna microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome; germfree animal; human; immunology; intestine mucosa; listeriosis; microbiology; mucosal immunity; pathogenicity; peyer patch; signal transduction; bacteria (microorganisms); bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; listeria; listeria innocua; listeria monocytogenes; mus musculus; animals; bacterial proteins; bacterial translocation; bacteroides; cadherins; disease models, animal; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genome; germ-free life; humans; immunity, mucosal; intestinal mucosa; listeria infections; listeria monocytogenes; mice; mice, transgenic; oligonucleotide array sequence analysis; peyer's patches; signal transduction; software",No
"Germ-Free Conditions Modulate Host Purine Metabolism, Exacerbating Adenine-Induced Kidney Damage","Mishima E, Ichijo M, Kawabe T, Kikuchi K, Akiyama Y, Toyohara T, Suzuki T, Suzuki C, Asao A, Ishii N, Fukuda S, Abe T",2020,Article,10.3390/toxins12090547,"Alterations in microbiota are known to affect kidney disease conditions. We have previously shown that germ-free conditions exacerbated adenine-induced kidney damage in mice; however, the mechanism by which this occurs has not been elucidated. To explore this mechanism, we examined the influence of germ-free conditions on purine metabolism and renal immune responses involved in the kidney damage. Germ-free mice showed higher expression levels of purine-metabolizing enzymes such as xanthine dehydrogenase, which converts adenine to a nephrotoxic byproduct 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA). The germ-free mice also showed increased urinary excretion of allantoin, indicating enhanced purine metabolism. Metabolome analysis demonstrated marked differences in the purine metabolite levels in the feces of germ-free mice and mice with microbiota. Furthermore, unlike the germ-free condition, antibiotic treatment did not increase the expression of purine-metabolizing enzymes or exacerbate adenine-induced kidney damage. Considering renal immune responses, the germ-free mice displayed an absence of renal IL-17A expression. However, the adenine-induced kidney damage in wild-type mice was comparable to that in IL-17A-deficient mice, suggesting that IL-17A does not play a major role in the disease condition. Our results suggest that the enhanced host purine metabolism in the germ-free mice potentially promotes the conversion of the administered adenine into 2,8-DHA, resulting in exacerbated kidney damage. This further suggests a role of the microbiota in regulating host purine metabolism. © 2020 by the authors.","chronic kidney disease; gut-kidney axis; il-17; microbiota; th17; uremic toxins; uric acids; xanthine dehydrogenase; xanthine oxidase; 2,8 dihydroxyadenine; adenine; adenine hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl; adenosine; adenosine monophosphate deaminase; allantoin; ampicillin; antibiotic agent; creatinine; guanine; guanosine; guanosine phosphate reductase; hypoxanthine; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; inosine; interleukin 17 antibody; interleukin 23; isoflurane; metronidazole; neomycin; purine metabolizing enzyme; purine nucleoside phosphorylase 1; purine phosphoribosyl transferase 1; transcription factor foxp3; unclassified drug; urate; uric acid; vancomycin; xanthine; xanthine dehydrogenase; xanthine oxidase; adenine; il17a protein, mouse; interleukin 17; purine derivative; adult; analysis of variance; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; col1a1 gene; controlled study; diet; disease exacerbation; emr1 gene; fn1 gene; gene; gene expression; germfree animal; high performance liquid chromatography; histology; il1a gene; immune response; immunohistochemistry; immunological tolerance; intestine flora; kidney fibrosis; kidney injury; male; metabolome; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; purine metabolism; rna extraction; tgfb1 gene; urea nitrogen blood level; urinary excretion; acute kidney failure; animal; c57bl mouse; genetics; germfree animal; metabolism; pathology; physiology; transgenic mouse; acute kidney injury; adenine; animals; germ-free life; interleukin-17; male; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, transgenic; purines",No
"Longitudinal study of Clostridium difficile shedding in raccoons on swine farms and conservation areas in Ontario, Canada","Bondo KJ, Weese JS, Rouseau J, Jardine CM",2015,Article,10.1186/s12917-015-0563-x,"Background: Clostridium difficile is an important enteropathogen affecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. The objectives of this study were to 1) compare the prevalence and characteristics of C. difficile isolated from the feces of raccoons trapped on swine farms and conservation sites, and 2) investigate the role of raccoons as potential reservoirs for host-adapted strains of C. difficile using a longitudinal study. Fecal swabs were collected from raccoons at 5 conservation sites and 5 swine farms, once every five weeks, from May to November, 2012. Results: Clostridium difficile was isolated from 9 % (38/444) of samples, from 12 % (37/302) of raccoons, from all 10 sites. A total of 19 different ribotypes were identified, including 5 ribotypes that matched recognized international designations and which are also found in humans (001, 014, 056, 078, and 103). Location type (farm or conservation area) was not associated with C. difficile status (P = 0.448) but only 3 ribotypes (014, 056, and 078) were found in both location types. The prevalence of ribotype 078 was significantly higher on farms (4 %; 9/220) compared to conservation sites (1 %; 2/225) (P = 0.034). Only one of 108 raccoons caught in multiple sessions was positive on more than one occasion. Conclusions: We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that raccoons harbour host-adapted strains of C. difficile, rather, it appears that raccoons transiently acquire C. difficile from the environment. Raccoons are unlikely to be maintaining C. difficile, but because we detected C. difficile strains that have the potential to cause illness in humans and livestock, and because raccoons can move relatively large distances, they may play a role in the dissemination of pathogenic ribotypes of C. difficile throughout the environment. © 2015 Bondo et al.",clostridium difficile; conservation area; longitudinal study; procyon lotor; raccoon; swine farm; animal; animal husbandry; bacterial shedding; clostridium infections; disease carrier; feces; female; isolation and purification; longitudinal study; male; microbiology; ontario; peptoclostridium difficile; pig; raccoon; swine diseases; transmission; veterinary; animal husbandry; animals; bacterial shedding; clostridium difficile; clostridium infections; disease reservoirs; feces; female; longitudinal studies; male; ontario; raccoons; swine; swine diseases,No
The P2X7 ion channel is dispensable for energy and metabolic homeostasis of white and brown adipose tissues,"Tian T, Heine M, Evangelakos I, Jaeckstein MY, Schaltenberg N, Stähler T, Koch-Nolte F, Kumari M, Heeren J",2020,Article,10.1007/s11302-020-09738-7,"Several studies suggest a role of extracellular adenine nucleotides in regulating adipose tissue functions via the purinergic signaling network. Metabolic studies in mice with global deletion of the purinergic receptor P2X7 on the C57BL/6 background indicate that this receptor has only a minor role in adipose tissue for diet-induced inflammation or cold-triggered thermogenesis. However, recent data show that a polymorphism (P451L) present in C57BL/6 mice attenuates P2X7 receptor function, whereas BALB/c mice express the fully functional P451 allele. To determine the potential role of P2rx7 under metabolic and thermogenic stress conditions, we performed comparative studies using male P2rx7 knockout (KO) and respective wild-type controls on both BALB/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds. Our data show that adipose P2rx7 mRNA levels are increased in obese mice. Moreover, P2rx7 deficiency results in reduced levels of circulating CCL2 and IL6 with a moderate effect on gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers in white adipose tissue and liver of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. However, P2X7 expression does not alter body weight, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia associated with high-fat diet feeding on both genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, deficiency of P2rx7 is dispensable for energy expenditure at thermoneutral and acute cold exposure conditions. In summary, these data show that—apart from a moderate effect on inflammatory cytokines—P2X7 plays only a minor role in inflammatory and thermogenic effects of white and brown adipose tissue even on the BALB/c background. © 2020, The Author(s).",adipose tissue; energy metabolism; obesity; p2x7 ion channel; purinergic signaling; 5' nucleotidase; adenine nucleotide; adp ribosyl cyclase/cyclic adp ribose hydrolase 1; beta galactosidase; cd11b antigen; cd39 antigen; cholesterol; collagenase; drug metabolizing enzyme; gamma tubulin; glucose; horseradish peroxidase; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; ion channel; messenger rna; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; neomycin; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; purinergic p2x4 receptor; purinergic p2x5 receptor; purinergic p2x7 receptor; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; uncoupling protein 1; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body composition; body weight; brown adipose tissue; calorimetry; cb6f1 mouse; chemiluminescence immunoassay; cold exposure; controlled study; diet induced obesity; endothelium cell; energy expenditure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; gene frequency; genetic polymorphism; glucose tolerance test; histology; homeostasis; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; lipid diet; macrophage; male; metabolic homeostasis; metabolomics; microscopy; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; oxygen consumption; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; rna isolation; signal transduction; thermogenesis; western blotting; white adipose tissue,No

Recent studies of other vector-borne illnesses have shown that arthropod microbiota influences the ability of infectious agents to colonize the insect vector and transmit to the human host. This has garnered attention as a potential control strategy against T. cruzi, as vector control is the main tool of Chagas disease prevention. Here we characterized the microbiota in T. infestans feces of both wild-caught and laboratory-reared insects and examined the relationship between microbial composition and T. cruzi infection using highly sensitive high-throughput sequencing technology to sequence the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene on the MiSeq Illumina platform. We collected 59 wild (9 with T. cruzi infection) and 10 lab-reared T. infestans (4 with T. cruzi infection) from the endemic area of Arequipa, Perú. Wild T. infestans had greater hindgut bacterial diversity than laboratory-reared bugs. Microbiota of lab insects comprised a subset of those identified in their wild counterparts, with 96 of the total 124 genera also observed in laboratory-reared insects. Among wild insects, variation in bacterial composition was observed, but time and location of collection and development stage did not explain this variation. T. cruzi infection in lab insects did not affect α-or β-diversity; however, we did find that the β-diversity of wild insects differed if they were infected with T. cruzi and identified 10 specific taxa that had significantly different relative abundances in infected vs. uninfected wild T. infestans (Bosea, Mesorhizo-bium, Dietzia, and Cupriavidus were underrepresented in infected bugs; Sporosarcina, an unclassified genus of Porphyromonadaceae, Nestenrenkonia, Alkalibacterium, Peptoniphi-lus, Marinilactibacillus were overrepresented in infected bugs). Our findings suggest that T. cruzi infection is associated with the microbiota of T. infestans and that inferring the microbiota of wild T. infestans may not be possible through sampling of T. infestans reared in the insectary. © 2019 Waltmann et al.","; rna 16s; bacterial dna; rna 16s; actinobacteria; arthrodesis; arthropod; article; bacteroidetes; cyanobacterium; disease transmission; dna extraction; feces microflora; gene sequence; insect vector; intestine flora; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; peptoniphilus; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; proteobacteria; restriction fragment length polymorphism; rhizobiales; rna sequence; sanger sequencing; time series analysis; triatoma infestans; trypanosoma; trypanosoma cruzi; vector control; wolbachia; animal; bacterium; chagas disease; classification; feces; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; human; isolation and purification; laboratory; microbiology; microflora; parasitology; physiology; triatoma; animals; bacteria; chagas disease; dna, bacterial; feces; gastrointestinal tract; humans; insect vectors; laboratories; microbiota; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal, 16s; triatoma; trypanosoma cruzi",Yes
The alternative sigma factor σB plays a crucial role in adaptive strategies of Clostridium difficile during gut infection,"Kint N, Janoir C, Monot M, Hoys S, Soutourina O, Dupuy B, Martin-Verstraete I",2017,Article,10.1111/1462-2920.13696,"Clostridium difficile is a major cause of diarrhoea associated with antibiotherapy. Exposed to stresses in the gut, C. difficile can survive by inducing protection, detoxification and repair systems. In several firmicutes, most of these systems are controlled by the general stress response involving σB. In this work, we studied the role of σB in the physiopathology of C. difficile. We showed that the survival of the sigB mutant during the stationary phase was reduced. Using a transcriptome analysis, we showed that σB controls the expression of ∼25% of genes including genes involved in sporulation, metabolism, cell surface biogenesis and the management of stresses. By contrast, σB does not control toxin gene expression. In agreement with the up-regulation of sporulation genes, the sporulation efficiency is higher in the sigB mutant than in the wild-type strain. sigB inactivation also led to increased sensitivity to acidification, cationic antimicrobial peptides, nitric oxide and ROS. In addition, we showed for the first time that σB also plays a crucial role in oxygen tolerance in this strict anaerobe. Finally, we demonstrated that the fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","; bacterial protein; sigb protein, bacteria; sigma factor; virulence factor; animal; bacterial spore; c3h mouse; diarrhea; dna repair; female; gastrointestinal tract; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; germfree animal; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; mouse; multidrug resistance; oxidative stress; pathogenicity; peptoclostridium difficile; upregulation; animals; bacterial proteins; clostridium difficile; diarrhea; dna repair; drug resistance, multiple, bacterial; female; gastrointestinal tract; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation, bacterial; germ-free life; mice; mice, inbred c3h; oxidative stress; sigma factor; spores, bacterial; up-regulation; virulence factors",No
Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase Detoxifies Lipopolysaccharide and Prevents Inflammation in Zebrafish in Response to the Gut Microbiota,"Bates JM, Akerlund J, Mittge E, Guillemin K",2007,Article,10.1016/j.chom.2007.10.010,"Vertebrates harbor abundant lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their gut microbiota. Alkaline phosphatases can dephosphorylate and detoxify the endotoxin component of LPS. Here, we show that expression of the zebrafish intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Iap), localized to the intestinal lumen brush border, is induced during establishment of the gut microbiota. Iap-deficient zebrafish are hypersensitive to LPS toxicity and exhibit the excessive intestinal neutrophil influx characteristic of wild-type zebrafish exposed to LPS. Both of these Iap mutant phenotypes are dependent on Myd88 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (Tnfr), proteins also involved in LPS sensitivity in mammals. When reared germ-free, the intestines of Iap-deficient zebrafish are devoid of neutrophils. Together, these findings demonstrate that the endogenous microbiota establish the normal homeostatic level of neutrophils in the zebrafish intestine through a process involving Iap, Myd88, and Tnfr. Thus, by preventing inflammatory responses, Iap plays a crucial role in promoting mucosal tolerance to resident gut bacteria. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Age-Dependent Allergic Asthma Development and Cystathionine Gamma-Lyase Deficiency,"Wang P, Wu L, Ju Y, Fu M, Shuang T, Qian Z, Wang R",2017,Article,10.1089/ars.2016.6875,"Aims: The pathogenic mechanisms for the higher prevalence of allergic asthma in children than in adults have not been settled. The aim of the present study is to examine whether the age-dependent development of allergic asthma is caused by age-dependent expression of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), a key enzyme that catalyzes the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Results: Allergic asthma was induced with ovalbumin in wild-type (WT) and CSE knock-out (KO) mice at young and old ages. CSE expression and H2S production were lower in immune cells of young WT mice than in those of old WT mice. Coincidentally, more severe asthmatic symptoms with a greater type-2 immunoreaction were found in young WT mice than old WT mice. H2S supplementation reversed the asthmatic symptoms. Lower expression levels of CSE proteins were also found in human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells in comparison with that of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adult people. The age-dependent asthma propensity vanished in CSE-KO mice, but these mice developed more severe asthma than WT mice. More splenocytes were differentiated to type-2 cytokine-generating cells in young WT mice and in CSE-KO mice at all ages. This differentiation was inhibited by H2S donors. GATA3 translocation to the nucleus and type-2 immunoreaction of splenocytes were inhibited after GATA3 was S-sulfhydrated by H2S. Innovation and Conclusion: For the first time, this study demonstrated that lower abundance of CSE expression and H2S production enhances type-2 immunoreaction and renders a higher incidence of allergic asthma at a young age. As such, H2S level may be a biomarker for asthma development and a H2S-based strategy can be perceived for asthma prevention and treatment. Antioxid.

Amazon fish bacterial communities show structural convergence along widespread hydrochemical gradients,"Sylvain F-É, Holland A, Audet-Gilbert É, Luis Val A, Derome N",2019,Article,10.1111/mec.15184,"The world's richest freshwater fish community thrives in gradients of contrasting environments in Amazonia, ranging from ion-poor acidic black waters, to ion-rich circumneutral white waters. These hydrochemical gradients structure Amazonian fish assemblages via ecological speciation events. Fish bacterial communities contain an important genetic heritage essential for their hosts' survival and are also involved in adaptive divergence via niche adaptation processes, but the extent to which they evolve in response to hydrochemical gradients in Amazonia is unknown. Here we investigated bacterial communities (gut and skin mucus) of two ecologically and phylogenetically divergent host species (Mesonauta festivus and Serrasalmus rhombeus) distributed throughout these hydrochemical gradients. The goal was to characterize intra- and interspecific Amazonian fish microbiome variations across multiple scales. Using a 16S metabarcoding approach, we investigated the microbiota of 43 wild M. festivus, 32 S. rhombeus and seven water samples, collected at seven sampling sites encompassing both water colours. Taxonomical structures of bacterial communities from both host species were significantly correlated to the environmental continua of magnesium, sodium, dissolved organic carbon, calcium, dissolved O2, pH, potassium, hardness and chloride. Analysis of discriminating features in community structures across multiple scales demonstrated intra- and interspecific structural parallelisms in the response to the hydrochemical gradients. Together, these parallelisms suggest the action of selection on bacterial community structures along Amazonian hydrochemical gradients. Functional approaches along with reciprocal transplant experiments will provide further insights on the potential contribution of Amazonian fish microbiomes in host adaptation and ecological speciation events. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","amazon; black water; fish; gut; microbiome; microbiota; water; animal; antibody specificity; brazil; evolution; fish; microbiology; microflora; nonparametric test; species difference; animals; biological evolution; brazil; fishes; microbiota; organ specificity; species specificity; statistics, nonparametric; water",No

Granulocytes Impose a Tight Bottleneck upon the Gut Luminal Pathogen Population during Salmonella Typhimurium Colitis,"Maier L, Diard M, Sellin ME, Chouffane E-S, Trautwein-Weidner K, Periaswamy B, Slack E, Dolowschiak T, Stecher B, Loverdo C, Regoes RR, Hardt W-D",2014,Article,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004557,"Topological, chemical and immunological barriers are thought to limit infection by enteropathogenic bacteria. However, in many cases these barriers and their consequences for the infection process remain incompletely understood. Here, we employed a mouse model for Salmonella colitis and a mixed inoculum approach to identify barriers limiting the gut luminal pathogen population. Mice were infected via the oral route with wild type S. Typhimurium (S. Tm) and/or mixtures of phenotypically identical but differentially tagged S. Tm strains (“WITS”, wild-type isogenic tagged strains), which can be individually tracked by quantitative real-time PCR. WITS dilution experiments identified a substantial loss in tag/genetic diversity within the gut luminal S. Tm population by days 2–4 post infection. The diversity-loss was not attributable to overgrowth by S. Tm mutants, but required inflammation, Gr-1+ cells (mainly neutrophilic granulocytes) and most likely NADPH-oxidase-mediated defense, but not iNOS. Mathematical modelling indicated that inflammation inflicts a bottleneck transiently restricting the gut luminal S. Tm population to approximately 6000 cells and plating experiments verified a transient, inflammation- and Gr-1+ cell-dependent dip in the gut luminal S. Tm population at day 2 post infection. We conclude that granulocytes, an important clinical hallmark of S. Tm-induced inflammation, impose a drastic bottleneck upon the pathogen population. This extends the current view of inflammation-fuelled gut-luminal Salmonella growth by establishing the host response in the intestinal lumen as a double-edged sword, fostering and diminishing colonization in a dynamic equilibrium.

Wild-type (WT) and MyD88-/- mice underwent jugular vein cannulation. One group received TPN without chow, and controls received standard chow. After 7 d, we harvested intestinal mucosally associated bacteria and isolated small-bowel lamina propria (LP) cells. Bacterial populations were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing. LP cells were analyzed using quantitative PCR and multicolor flow cytometry. WT, control mucosally associated microbiota were Firmicutesdominant, whereas WT TPN mice were Proteobacteria-domiant. Similar changes were observed in MyD88-/- mice with TPN administration. UniFrac analysis showed divergent small bowel and colonic bacterial communities in controls, merging toward similar microbiota (but distinct from controls) with TPN. The percentage of LP T regulatory cells significantly decreased with TPN in WT mice. F4/80+CD11b +CD11cdull/- macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines significantly increased with TPN. These proinflammatory immunologic changes were significantly abrogated in MyD88-/- TPN mice. Thus, TPN administration is associated with significant expansion of Proteobacteria within the intestinal microbiota and increased proinflammatory LP cytokines. Additionally, MyD88 signaling blockade abrogated decline in epithelial cell proliferation and epithelial barrier function loss.

"The short-chain fatty acid receptor, FFA2, contributes to gestational glucose homeostasis","Fuller M, Priyadarshini M, Gibbons SM, Angueira AR, Brodsky M, Geoffrey Hayes M, Kovatcheva-Datchary P, Bäckhed F, Gilbert JA, Lowe WL, Jr, Layden BT",2015,Article,10.1152/ajpendo.00171.2015,"The structure of the human gastrointestinal microbiota can change during pregnancy, which may influence gestational metabolism; however, a mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we observed that in wild-type (WT) mice the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased during pregnancy. Along with these changes, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are mainly produced through gut microbiota fermentation, significantly changed in both the cecum and peripheral blood throughout gestation in these mice. SCFAs are recognized by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as free fatty acid receptor-2 (FFA2), and we have previously demonstrated that the fatty acid receptor-2 gene (Ffar2) expression is higher in pancreatic islets during pregnancy. Using female Ffar2−/−mice, we explored the physiological relevance of signaling through this GPCR and found that Ffar2-deficient female mice developed fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance in the setting of impaired insulin secretion compared with WT mice during, but not before, pregnancy. Insulin tolerance tests were similar in Ffar2−/−and WT mice before and during pregnancy. Next, we examined the role of FFA2 in gestational β-cell mass, observing that Ffar2−/−mice had diminished gestational expansion of β-cells during pregnancy. Interestingly, mouse genotype had no significant impact on the composition of the gut microbiome, but did affect the observed SCFA profiles, suggesting a functional difference in the microbiota. Together, these results suggest a potential link between increased Ffar2 expression in islets and the alteration of circulating SCFA levels, possibly explaining how changes in the gut microbiome contribute to gestational glucose homeostasis. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.","free fatty acid receptor-2; gut microbiome; islets; free fatty acid receptor 2; g protein coupled receptor; glucose; insulin; unclassified drug; cell surface receptor; free fatty acid 2 receptor, mouse; insulin; volatile fatty acid; actinobacteria; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacteroidetes; cecum; cell expansion; controlled study; fatty acid blood level; female; glucose homeostasis; hyperglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin tolerance test; intestine flora; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; pregnancy; priority journal; protein function; signal transduction; agonists; animal; blood; c57bl mouse; chemistry; classification; fermentation; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; knockout mouse; metabolism; microbiology; molecular typing; mollicutes; pancreas islet beta cell; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; principal component analysis; secretion (process); stomach juice; tissue culture technique; actinobacteria; animals; bacteroidetes; cecum; diabetes, gestational; fatty acids, volatile; female; fermentation; gastrointestinal contents; gastrointestinal microbiome; insulin; insulin-secreting cells; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; molecular typing; pregnancy; pregnancy maintenance; principal component analysis; receptors, cell surface; tenericutes; tissue culture techniques",No

Wolbachia does not naturally infect Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue virus, but transinfected Ae. aegypti have antidengue virus properties and are currently being trialled as a dengue biocontrol strategy. Here, we assess the impact of Wolbachia infection of Ae. aegypti on the microbiome of wild mosquito populations (adults and larvae) collected from release sites in Cairns, Australia, by profiling the 16S rRNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Our data indicate that Wolbachia reduces the relative abundance of a large proportion of bacterial taxa in Ae. aegypti adults, that is in accordance with the known pathogen-blocking effects of Wolbachia on a variety of bacteria and viruses. In adults, several of the most abundant bacterial genera were found to undergo significant shifts in relative abundance. However, the genera showing the greatest changes in relative abundance in Wolbachia-infected adults represented a low proportion of the total microbiome. In addition, there was little effect of Wolbachia infection on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa in larvae, or on species diversity (accounting for species richness and evenness together) detected in adults or larvae.

Metaproteomics of Colonic Microbiota Unveils Discrete Protein Functions among Colitic Mice and Control Groups,"Moon C, Stupp GS, Su AI, Wolan DW",2018,Article,10.1002/pmic.201700391,"Metaproteomics can greatly assist established high-throughput sequencing methodologies to provide systems biological insights into the alterations of microbial protein functionalities correlated with disease-associated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. Here, the authors utilize the well-characterized murine T cell transfer model of colitis to find specific changes within the intestinal luminal proteome associated with inflammation. MS proteomic analysis of colonic samples permitted the identification of ≈10 000–12 000 unique peptides that corresponded to 5610 protein clusters identified across three groups, including the colitic Rag1−/− T cell recipients, isogenic Rag1−/− controls, and wild-type mice.

Epithelial-specific Toll-like Receptor (TLR)5 Activation Mediates Barrier Dysfunction in Experimental Ileitis,"Lopetuso LR, Jia R, Wang X-M, Jia L-G, Petito V, Goodman WA, Meddings JB, Cominelli F, Reuter BK, Pizarro TT",2017,Article,10.1097/MIB.0000000000001035,"Background: A large body of evidence supports a central role of TLR5 and its natural ligand, flagellin, in Crohn's disease (CD), with the precise mechanism(s) still unresolved. Methods: We investigated the role of flagellin/TLR5 in SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice, a spontaneous model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis. Results: Ileal Tlr5 and serum antiflagellin IgG antibodies were increased in SAMP before the onset of inflammation and during established disease; these trends were abrogated in the absence of colonizing commensal bacteria. Irradiated SAMP receiving either wild-Type (AKR) or SAMP bone marrow (BM) developed severe ileitis and displayed increased ileal Tlr5 compared with AKR recipients of either SAMP or AKR bone marrow, neither of which conferred ileitis, suggesting that elevated TLR5 in native SAMP is derived primarily from a nonhematopoietic (e.g., epithelial) source. Indeed, ileal epithelial TLR5 in preinflamed SAMP was increased compared with age-matched AKR and germ-free SAMP. TLR5-specific ex vivo activation of SAMP ileal tissues decreased epithelial barrier resistance, indicative of increased permeability, and was accompanied by altered expression of the tight junction proteins, claudin-3, occludin, and zonula occludens-1. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that aberrant, elevated TLR5 expression is present in the ileal epithelium of SAMP mice, is augmented in the presence of the gut microbiome, and that TLR5 activation in response to bacterial flagellin results in a deficiency to maintain appropriate epithelial barrier integrity.

However, the role of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the development of IBD is still largely unknown. Here, we used C6-deficient mice in which MAC formation was blocked due to the absence of C6 to develop an acute colitis model by the administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The results showed that DSS-induced colitis was aggravated in C6-deficient mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice, as represented by the markedly greater weight loss, higher disease activity index (DAI), shortened colon length, more severe histological injury with increased epithelial ulcerations, and massively increased infiltration of leukocytes accompanied by much higher myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in local inflammatory colonic sites. In addition, the DSS-induced colitis in C6-deficient mice could be significantly ameliorated by the exogenous C6 from WT sera. Furthermore, the significantly enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL-1, CCL-3, TGF-β1 and IL-17F, was also observed in C6-deficient mice.

Impact of nutritional stress on the honeybee colony health,"Branchiccela B, Castelli L, Corona M, Díaz-Cetti S, Invernizzi C, Martínez de la Escalera G, Mendoza Y, Santos E, Silva C, Zunino P, Antúnez K",2019,Article,10.1038/s41598-019-46453-9,"Honeybees Apis mellifera are important pollinators of wild plants and commercial crops. For more than a decade, high percentages of honeybee colony losses have been reported worldwide. Nutritional stress due to habitat depletion, infection by different pests and pathogens and pesticide exposure has been proposed as the major causes. In this study we analyzed how nutritional stress affects colony strength and health. Two groups of colonies were set in a Eucalyptus grandis plantation at the beginning of the flowering period (autumn), replicating a natural scenario with a nutritionally poor food source. While both groups of colonies had access to the pollen available in this plantation, one was supplemented with a polyfloral pollen patty during the entire flowering period. In the short-term, colonies under nutritional stress (which consumed mainly E. grandis pollen) showed higher infection level with Nosema spp. and lower brood and adult bee population, compared to supplemented colonies. On the other hand, these supplemented colonies showed higher infection level with RNA viruses although infection levels were low compared to countries were viral infections have negative impacts. Nutritional stress also had long-term colony effects, because bee population did not recover in spring, as in supplemented colonies did. In conclusion, nutritional stress and Nosema spp. infection had a severe impact on colony strength with consequences in both short and long-term. © 2019, The Author(s).","; animal; animal food; bee; colony collapse; eucalyptus; genetics; microbiology; nosema; pathogenicity; physiological stress; physiology; pollen; trypanosomatidae; varroidae; animal nutritional physiological phenomena; animals; bees; colony collapse; eucalyptus; nosema; pollen; stress, physiological; trypanosomatina; varroidae",No
"Insights in the Global Genetics and Gut Microbiome of Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia illucens: Implications for Animal Feed Safety Control","Khamis FM, Ombura FLO, Akutse KS, Subramanian S, Mohamed SA, Fiaboe KKM, Saijuntha W, Van Loon JJA, Dicke M, Dubois T, Ekesi S, Tanga CM",2020,Article,10.3389/fmicb.2020.01538,"The utilization of the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens L. for recycling organic waste into high-quality protein and fat biomass for animal feeds has gained momentum worldwide. However, information on the genetic diversity and environmental implications on safety of the larvae is limited. This study delineates genetic variability and unravels gut microbiome complex of wild-collected and domesticated BSF populations from six continents using mitochondrial COI gene and 16S metagenomics. All sequences generated from the study linked to H. illucens accessions KM967419.1, FJ794355.1, FJ794361.1, FJ794367.1, KC192965.1, and KY817115.1 from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences generated from the study and rooted by GenBank accessions of Hermetia albitarsis Fabricius and Hermetia sexmaculata Macquart separated all samples into three branches, with H. illucens and H. sexmaculata being closely related. Genetic distances between H. illucens samples from the study and GenBank accessions of H. illucens ranged between 0.0091 and 0.0407 while H. sexmaculata and H. albitarsis samples clearly separated from all H. illucens by distances of 0.1745 and 0.1903, respectively. Genetic distance matrix was used to generate a principal coordinate plot that further confirmed the phylogenetic clustering. Haplotype network map demonstrated that Australia, United States 1 (Rhode Island), United States 2 (Colorado), Kenya, and China shared a haplotype, while Uganda shared a haplotype with GenBank accession KC192965 BSF from United States. All other samples analyzed had individual haplotypes. Out of 481,695 reads analyzed from 16S metagenomics, four bacterial families (Enterobactereaceae, Dysgonomonadaceae, Wohlfahrtiimonadaceae, and Enterococcaceae) were most abundant in the BSF samples. Alpha-diversity, as assessed by Shannon index, showed that the Kenyan and Thailand populations had the highest and lowest microbe diversity, respectively; while microbial diversity assessed through Bray Curtis distance showed United States 3 (Maysville) and Netherlands populations to be the most dissimilar. Our findings on genetic diversity revealed slight phylogeographic variation between BSF populations across the globe. The 16S data depicted larval gut bacterial families with economically important genera that might pose health risks to both animals and humans.

In vitro fermentation pattern in the large intestine of hybrids between wild boars and domestic pigs-a preliminary study,"Miśta D, Króliczewska B, Pecka-Kiełb E, Bujok J, Zawadzki W, Górecka J, Piekarska J",2016,Article,10.17221/7,"Breeding of hybrids between wild boars and domestic pigs is in the consumer interest because of the need to ensure food security and diversification via widening the genetic basis of animals reared for meat. To expand the knowledge about their nutritional requirements, this study aimed to investigate hindgut fermentation in these animals. Caecal and colon cultures were incubated for 12 h in vitro with or without wheat bran as a supplementary substrate. Short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, methane, and total gas production were determined. The total concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in unincubated caecal and colon samples were 93.1 and 115 mmol/kg, respectively. The short-chain fatty acid profile in fresh hindgut contents was characterized by a high molar proportion of acetate (74.8-75.0 mol%), followed by propionate (18.2-18.5 mol%) and butyrate (5.4-5.5 mol%). The presence of wheat bran lowered acetate and increased butyrate, propionate, and valerate molar proportions. The ammonia level remained low (1.3-2.43 mmol/kg) regardless of the addition of the substrate. The relatively low pH and ammonia concentration in wild boar/pig hybrids may be caused by the low level of crude protein in diet of these animals. The rate of methanogenesis increased during the fermentation simultaneously with an increase in the production of gases after wheat bran addition. Methane production in the caecal and colon samples incubated with the substrate reached 15.6 and 16.1 mmol/kg, respectively. The hindgut fermentation pattern in wild boar/pig hybrids generally resembled that described earlier in domestic pigs, although some observed dissimilarities may be caused by distinct microbial activity.",caecal fermentation; colon fermentation; cross-breed; methane; short-chain fatty acids; sus scrofa; ,No
Habitat environments impacted the gut microbiome of long-distance migratory swan geese but central species conserved,"Wu Y, Yang Y, Cao L, Yin H, Xu M, Wang Z, Liu Y, Wang X, Deng Y",2018,Article,10.1038/s41598-018-31731-9,"The gut microbime plays an important role in the health of wild animals. This microbial community could be altered by habitat pollution and other human activities that threaten the host organisms. Here, we satellite-tracked a flock of swan geese (Anser cygnoides) migrating from their breeding area (Khukh Lake, Mongolia), with low levels of human activity, to their wintering area (Poyang Lake, China) which has been heavily impacted by human activities. Twenty fecal samples were collected from each site. High-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS was employed to explore bacterial and fungal composition and diversity of their gut microbiome. Although general composition, alpha-diversity, functional prediction, and the central taxa in the phylogenetic networks showed some similarities between the two habitats, significant divergences were detected in terms of beta-diversity, species abundances, and interaction network topologies. In addition, disease-related and xenobiotic biodegradation pathways, and pathogenic bacteria were significantly increased in bacterial communities from samples at Poyang Lake. Our results reveal that the gut microbiome of swan geese, while somewhat altered after long-distance migration, still maintained a core group of species. We also show that habitat environmental stress could impact these gut microbial communities, suggesting that habitat pollution could indirectly threaten wild animals by altering their gut microbiome. © 2018, The Author(s).","; animal; bacterium; classification; ecosystem; fungus; goose; growth, development and aging; intestine flora; microbiology; phylogeny; population migration; animal migration; animals; bacteria; ecosystem; fungi; gastrointestinal microbiome; geese; phylogeny",Yes

Genome-enabled exploration of microbial ecology and evolution in the sea: a rising tide lifts all boats,DeLong EF,2021,Article,10.1111/1462-2920.15403,"As a young bacteriologist just launching my career during the early days of the ‘microbial revolution’ in the 1980s, I was fortunate to participate in some early discoveries, and collaborate in the development of cross-disciplinary methods now commonly referred to as ""metagenomics"". My early scientific career focused on applying phylogenetic and genomic approaches to characterize ‘wild’ bacteria, archaea and viruses in their natural habitats, with an emphasis on marine systems. These central interests have not changed very much for me over the past three decades, but knowledge, methodological advances and new theoretical perspectives about the microbial world certainly have. In this invited ‘How we did it’ perspective, I trace some of the trajectories of my lab's collective efforts over the years, including phylogenetic surveys of microbial assemblages in marine plankton and sediments, development of microbial community gene- and genome-enabled surveys, and application of genome-guided, cultivation-independent functional characterization of novel enzymes, pathways and their relationships to in situ biogeochemistry.

Toll-like receptor 2-mediated intestinal injury and enteric tumor necrosis factor receptor i contribute to liver fibrosis in mice,"Hartmann P, Haimerl M, Mazagova M, Brenner DA, Schnabl B",2012,Article,10.1053/j.gastro.2012.07.099,"Background &amp; Aims: Progression of liver fibrosis in experimental models depends on gut-derived bacterial products, but little is known about mechanisms of disruption of the mucosal barrier or translocation. We used a mouse model of cholestatic liver disease to investigate mechanisms of intestinal barrier disruption following liver injury. Methods: Liver fibrosis and bacterial translocation were assessed in Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-deficient and tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFRI)-deficient mice subjected to bile duct ligation. Epithelial and lamina propria cells were isolated and analyzed by immunoblot analyses and flow cytometry. We analyzed bone marrow chimeras and mice with a conditional gain-of-function allele for the TNFRI receptor. By crossing TNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice with mice that expressed the VillinCre transgene specifically in intestinal epithelial cells, we created mice that express functional TNFRI specifically on intestinal epithelial cells (VillinCreTNFRIflxneo/flxneo mice). Results: Following bile duct ligation, TLR2-deficient mice had less liver fibrosis and intestinal translocation of bacteria and bacterial products than wild-type mice. Mice with hematopoietic cells that did not express TLR2 also had reduced bacterial translocation, indicating that TLR2 expression by hematopoietic cells regulates intestinal barrier function. The number of TLR2+ monocytes that produce tumor necrosis factor α increased in the intestinal lamina propria of wild-type mice following bile duct ligation; bacterial translocation was facilitated by TNFRI-mediated signals on intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusions: Intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation contribute to liver fibrosis via TLR2 signaling on monocytes in the lamina propria and TNFRI signaling on intestinal epithelial cells in mice. Therefore, enteric TNFRI is an important mediator of cholestatic liver fibrosis. © 2012 AGA Institute.",endotoxin; intestinal inflammation; microbiome; microbiota composition; toll like receptor 2; tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; allele; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial translocation; controlled study; epithelium cell; flow cytometry; gain of function mutation; hematopoietic cell; immunoblotting; intestine injury; lamina propria; liver fibrosis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; transgene; villincre gene,No

Here, we report a critical role for interleukin-22 (IL-22) in systemic protection against bacterial pathobionts that translocate into the circulation after infection with the pathogen Clostridium difficile. Infection with C.difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22-/- mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. Pathobionts exhibited increased resistant against complement-mediated phagocytosis, and their intravenous administration resulted in high animal mortality. Selective removal of translocated commensals rescued Il22-/- mice, and IL-22 administration enhanced the elimination of pathobionts. Mechanistically, IL-22 augmented bacterial phagocytosis by increasing the expression and bacterial binding of complement C3.

Midgut microbiota of the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae and interactions with Plasmodium falciparum infection,"Boissière A, Tchioffo MT, Bachar D, Abate L, Marie A, Nsango SE, Shahbazkia HR, Awono-Ambene PH, Levashina EA, Christen R, Morlais I",2012,Article,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002742,"The susceptibility of Anopheles mosquitoes to Plasmodium infections relies on complex interactions between the insect vector and the malaria parasite. A number of studies have shown that the mosquito innate immune responses play an important role in controlling the malaria infection and that the strength of parasite clearance is under genetic control, but little is known about the influence of environmental factors on the transmission success. We present here evidence that the composition of the vector gut microbiota is one of the major components that determine the outcome of mosquito infections. A. gambiae mosquitoes collected in natural breeding sites from Cameroon were experimentally challenged with a wild P. falciparum isolate, and their gut bacterial content was submitted for pyrosequencing analysis. The meta-taxogenomic approach revealed a broader richness of the midgut bacterial flora than previously described. Unexpectedly, the majority of bacterial species were found in only a small proportion of mosquitoes, and only 20 genera were shared by 80% of individuals. We show that observed differences in gut bacterial flora of adult mosquitoes is a result of breeding in distinct sites, suggesting that the native aquatic source where larvae were grown determines the composition of the midgut microbiota. Importantly, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in the mosquito midgut correlates significantly with the Plasmodium infection status. This striking relationship highlights the role of natural gut environment in parasite transmission.

Increased Expression of DUOX2 Is an Epithelial Response to Mucosal Dysbiosis Required for Immune Homeostasis in Mouse Intestine,"Grasberger H, Gao J, Nagao-Kitamoto H, Kitamoto S, Zhang M, Kamada N, Eaton KA, El-Zaatari M, Shreiner AB, Merchant JL, Owyang C, Kao JY",2015,Article,10.1053/j.gastro.2015.07.062,"Background &amp; Aims Dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), a hydrogen-peroxide generator at the apical membrane of gastrointestinal epithelia, is up-regulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) before the onset of inflammation, but little is known about its effects. We investigated the role of DUOX2 in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis in mice. Methods We analyzed the regulation of DUOX2 in intestinal tissues of germ-free vs conventional mice, mice given antibiotics or colonized with only segmented filamentous bacteria, mice associated with human microbiota, and mice with deficiencies in interleukin (IL) 23 and IL22 signaling. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction of intestinal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes of Duoxa-/- mice that lack functional DUOX enzymes. Genes differentially expressed in Duoxa-/- mice compared with co-housed wild-type littermates were correlated with gene expression changes in early-stage IBD using gene set enrichment analysis. Results Colonization of mice with segmented filamentous bacteria up-regulated intestinal expression of DUOX2. DUOX2 regulated redox signaling within mucosa-associated microbes and restricted bacterial access to lymphatic tissues of the mice, thereby reducing microbiota-induced immune responses. Induction of Duox2 transcription by microbial colonization did not require the mucosal cytokines IL17 or IL22, although IL22 increased expression of Duox2. Dysbiotic, but not healthy human microbiota, activated a DUOX2 response in recipient germ-free mice that corresponded to abnormal colonization of the mucosa with distinct populations of microbes. In Duoxa-/- mice, abnormalities in ileal mucosal gene expression at homeostasis recapitulated those in patients with mucosal dysbiosis. Conclusions DUOX2 regulates interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosa to maintain immune homeostasis in mice. Mucosal dysbiosis leads to increased expression of DUOX2, which might be a marker of perturbed mucosal homeostasis in patients with early-stage IBD. © 2015 AGA Institute.","gastroenterology; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine; microbial dysbiosis; antibiotic agent; bacterial dna; cxcl1 chemokine; dual oxidase 2; hydrogen peroxide; interleukin 17; interleukin 22; interleukin 23; macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha; messenger rna; oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; rna 16s; streptomycin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; duox1 protein, mouse; duox2 protein, human; interleukin derivative; interleukin receptor; interleukin-22; interleukin-23 receptor, mouse; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; comparative study; controlled study; down regulation; dysbiosis; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene expression profiling; homeostasis; human; immune homeostasis; immune response; in vivo study; inflammatory bowel disease; mesentery lymph node; microbial colonization; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; upregulation; animal; bacterial translocation; bacterium; biosynthesis; c57bl mouse; classification; deficiency; disease model; drug effects; enzyme induction; enzymology; epithelium cell; feces; female; gastroenteritis; genetic transcription; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; male; metabolism; microbiology; mucosal immunity; pathogenicity; permeability; ribotyping; salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium; salmonellosis; signal transduction; tissue culture technique; animals; anti-bacterial agents; bacteria; bacterial translocation; disease models, animal; dysbiosis; enzyme induction; epithelial cells; feces; female; gastroenteritis; host-pathogen interactions; humans; immunity, mucosal; inflammatory bowel diseases; interleukins; intestinal mucosa; male; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; nadph oxidase; permeability; receptors, interleukin; ribotyping; salmonella infections; salmonella typhimurium; signal transduction; tissue culture techniques; transcription, genetic",No
Cutaneous Nod2 Expression Regulates the Skin Microbiome and Wound Healing in a Murine Model,"Williams H, Crompton RA, Thomason HA, Campbell L, Singh G, McBain AJ, Cruickshank SM, Hardman MJ",2017,Article,10.1016/j.jid.2017.05.029,"The skin microbiome exists in dynamic equilibrium with the host, but when the skin is compromised, bacteria can colonize the wound and impair wound healing. Thus, the interplay between normal skin microbial interactions versus pathogenic microbial interactions in wound repair is important. Bacteria are recognized by innate host pattern recognition receptors, and we previously showed an important role for the pattern recognition receptor NOD2 in skin wound repair. NOD2 is implicated in changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in Crohn's disease, but its role on skin microbiota is unknown. Nod2-deficient (Nod2–/–) mice had an inherently altered skin microbiome compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, we found that Nod2–/– skin microbiome dominated and caused impaired healing, shown in cross-fostering experiments of wild-type pups with Nod2–/– pups, which then acquired altered cutaneous bacteria and delayed healing. High-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR showed a significant compositional shift, specifically in the genus Pseudomonas in Nod2–/– mice. To confirm whether Pseudomonas species directly impair wound healing, wild-type mice were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and, akin to Nod2–/– mice, were found to exhibit a significant delay in wound repair.

Materials and Methods: Fecal sampling from three female orangutans, around 35 years old, was carried out in the wild forest areas at the research station of Suaq Belimbing Gunung Leuser National Park located in the South Aceh district. Orangutan fecal samples were taken in the morning when the orangutans first defecated. The orangutans were above the tree, which is approximately 12-15 m from the ground where feces were found. Results: Fermentation testing using the API 50 CHL Kit showed that OUL4 isolates were identified as Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis with an identity value of 73.5%. Homology analysis demonstrated that the OUL4 isolates have 93% similarity to Weissella cibaria, and phylogenetic trees constructed using Mega 7.0 also showed that OUL4 isolates are related to W. cibaria. Conclusion: These results show that there is a difference in identification between biochemical testing with API kits and molecular analyses on LAB isolates from wild Sumatran orangutans.

Altered Gut Microbiota in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease,"Zhang L, Wang Y, Xiayu X, Shi C, Chen W, Song N, Fu X, Zhou R, Xu Y-F, Huang L, Zhu H, Han Y, Qin C",2017,Article,10.3233/JAD-170020,"The topic of gut microbiota is currently attracting considerable interest as a potential factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent and time course of alterations in the gut microbiota, and their effects on AD pathology remain uncertain. Herein, we compared the fecal microbiomes and fecal short chain fatty acid composition (SCFAs) between wild-type and AD model mice at different ages under strictly controlled specific pathogen free conditions, and also conducted microscopic investigations of intestinal structures. Our results showed that the microbiota composition and diversity were perturbed and the level of SCFAs was reduced in AD mice, predicting alterations in more than 30 metabolic pathways, which may be associated with amyloid deposition and ultrastructural abnormalities in AD mouse intestine. These findings indicate that AD pathology might not only affect brain function directly, but also exacerbate cognitive deficits through reducing the level of SCFAs via alterations of gut microbiota induced by intestinal amyloid deposition. Our data may support a role of gut microbiota, and suggest a novel route for therapeutic intervention in AD. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Differential effects of commensal bacteria on progenitor cell adhesion, division symmetry and tumorigenesis in the Drosophila intestine","Ferguson M, Petkau K, Shin M, Galenza A, Fast D, Foley E",2021,Article,10.1242/dev.186106,"Microbial factors influence homeostatic and oncogenic growth in the intestinal epithelium. However, we know little about immediate effects of commensal bacteria on stem cell division programs. In this study, we examined the effects of commensal Lactobacillus species on homeostatic and tumorigenic stem cell proliferation in the female Drosophila intestine. We identified Lactobacillus brevis as a potent stimulator of stem cell divisions. In a wild-Type midgut, L. brevis activates growth regulatory pathways that drive stem cell divisions. In a Notch-deficient background, L. brevis-mediated proliferation causes rapid expansion of mutant progenitors, leading to accumulation of large, multi-layered tumors throughout the midgut.

The skin microbiome of caspase-14-deficient mice shows mild dysbiosis,"Kubica M, Hildebrand F, Brinkman BM, Goossens D, Del Favero J, Vercammen K, Cornelis P, Schröder J-M, Vandenabeele P, Raes J, Declercq W",2014,Article,10.1111/exd.12458,"Caspase-14, an important proteinase involved in filaggrin catabolism, is mainly active in terminally differentiating keratinocytes, where it is required for the generation of skin natural moisturizing factors (NMFs). Consequently, caspase-14 deficient epidermis is characterized by reduced levels of NMFs such as urocanic acid and 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid. Patients suffering from filaggrin deficiency are prone to develop atopic dermatitis, which is accompanied with increased microbial burden. Among several reasons, this effect could be due to a decrease in filaggrin breakdown products. In this study, we found that caspase-14-/- mice show enhanced antibacterial response compared to wild-type mice when challenged with bacteria. Therefore, we compared the microbial communities between wild-type and caspase-14-/- mice by sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. We observed that caspase-14 ablation leads to an increase in bacterial richness and diversity during steady-state conditions. Although both wild-type and caspase-14-/- skin were dominated by the Firmicutes phylum, the Staphylococcaceae family was reduced in caspase-14-/- mice. Altogether, our data demonstrated that caspase-14 deficiency causes the imbalance of the skin-resident bacterial communities. © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.","antimicrobial activity; caspase-14; microbiome; caspase 14; rna 16s; caspase 14; urocanic acid; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibacterial activity; article; comparative study; controlled study; dysbiosis; enzyme deficiency; epidermis; firmicutes; microbial community; microbiome; mouse; nonhuman; rna sequence; skin; skin flora; staphylococcaceae; steady state; wild type; animal; deficiency; disease model; dysbiosis; female; genetics; isolation and purification; knockout mouse; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; pathophysiology; physiology; skin; animals; caspase 14; disease models, animal; dysbiosis; female; mice; mice, knockout; microbiota; skin; staphylococcaceae; urocanic acid",No
The fasting-induced adipose factor/angiopoietin-like protein 4 is physically associated with lipoproteins and governs plasma lipid levels and adiposity,"Mandard S, Zandbergen F, Van Straten E, Wahli W, Kuipers F, Müller M, Kersten S",2006,Article,10.1074/jbc.M506519200,"Proteins secreted from adipose tissue are increasingly recognized to play an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. However, much less is known about their effect on lipid metabolism. The fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF/angiopoietin-like protein 4/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ angiopoietin-related protein) was previously identified as a target of hypolipidemic fibrate drugs and insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones. Using transgenic mice that mildly overexpress FIAF in peripheral tissues we show that FIAF is an extremely powerful regulator of lipid metabolism and adiposity. FIAF overexpression caused a 50% reduction in adipose tissue weight, partly by stimulating fatty acid oxidation and uncoupling in fat. In addition, FIAF overexpression increased plasma levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, glycerol, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Functional tests indicated that FIAF overexpression severely impaired plasma triglyceride clearance but had no effect on very low density lipoprotein production. The effects of FIAF overexpression were amplified by a high fat diet, resulting in markedly elevated plasma and liver triglycerides, plasma free fatty acids, and plasma glycerol levels, and impaired glucose tolerance in FIAF transgenic mice fed a high fat diet. Remarkably, in mice the full-length form of FIAF was physically associated with HDL, whereas truncated FIAF was associated with low density lipoprotein. In human both full-length and truncated FIAF were associated with HDL. The composite data suggest that via physical association with plasma lipoproteins, FIAF acts as a powerful signal from fat and other tissues to prevent fat storage and stimulate fat mobilization. Our data indicate that disturbances in FIAF signaling might be involved in dyslipidemia. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","; biochemistry; cholesterol; drug products; fatty acids; glucose; glycerol; lipids; metabolism; adiposity; glucose metabolism; lipoproteins; plasma lipid levels; proteins; adipocytokine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; protein fasting induced adipose factor; unclassified drug; angptl4 protein, mouse; cholesterol; fat; glucose; high density lipoprotein; insulin; lipid; lipoprotein; messenger rna; plasma protein; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; very low density lipoprotein; aerobic metabolism; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diet restriction; fatty acid blood level; fatty liver; gene expression; glycerol blood level; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; impaired glucose tolerance; lipid blood level; lipid diet; lipolysis; liver; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; protein expression; transgenic mouse; triacylglycerol blood level; wild type; adipose tissue; animal; biological model; blood; body weight; chemistry; dna microarray; enzymology; genetics; glucose tolerance test; human; immunoblotting; metabolism; physiology; protein binding; signal transduction; time; upregulation; animalia; mus musculus; adipose tissue; animals; blood proteins; body weight; cholesterol; fats; gene expression; glucose; glucose tolerance test; humans; hypercholesterolemia; immunoblotting; insulin; lipase; lipids; lipoproteins; lipoproteins, hdl; lipoproteins, ldl; lipoproteins, vldl; liver; male; mice; mice, transgenic; models, genetic; oligonucleotide array sequence analysis; protein binding; rna, messenger; signal transduction; time factors; triglycerides; up-regulation",No
Inhibition of XBP1s ubiquitination enhances its protein stability and improves glucose homeostasis,"Sun H, Wei G, Liu H, Xiao D, Huang J, Lu J, Miao J, Liu J, Chen S",2020,Article,10.1016/j.metabol.2019.154046,"Background: Hepatic ER stress is a risk factor of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. X-box binding protein 1 spliced (XBP1s), a transcription factor, plays a key role in ameliorating insulin resistance and maintaining glucose homeostasis. Unfortunately, the short half-life of the protein dampens its clinical application, and the specific site of lysine residue that could be ubiquitinated and involved in the degradation of XBP1s remains elusive. Methods and results: Here, we identified K60 and K77 on XBP1s as two pivotal ubiquitin sites required for its proteasome-dependent degradation. We also constructed a double mutant form of XBP1s (K60/77R) and found that it showed higher capacity in resisting against ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, increasing nuclear translocation, enhancing transcriptional activity, suppressing ER stress and promoting Foxo1 degradation, compared to that of wild type XBP1s (WT). Consistently, overexpression of the K60/77R XBP1s mutant in DIO mice increased the ability to reduce ER stress and decrease Foxo1 levels, thus contributed to maintaining glucose homeostasis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that delaying the degradation of XBP1s by preventing ubiquitination might provide a strategic approach for reducing ER stress as an anti-diabetes therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",glucose homeostasis; mutation; ubiquitination; xbp1s stability; recombinant human insulin; transcription factor fkhr; ubiquitin; x box binding protein 1; animal experiment; article; chemoluminescence; controlled study; diet-induced obesity; endoplasmic reticulum stress; gene overexpression; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance test; hek293-a cell line; hek293t cell line; human; human cell; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; insulin treatment; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein stability; real time polymerase chain reaction; rna extraction; ubiquitination; western blotting,No
IFN-alpha receptor deficiency enhances host resistance to oral Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection during murine pregnancy,"Agbayani G, Clark K, Sandhu JK, Hewitt M, Sad S, Murphy SP, Krishnan L",2021,Article,10.1111/aji.13454,"Problem: Maternal tolerance during pregnancy increases the risk of infection with certain intracellular pathogens. Systemic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.Tm) infection during pregnancy in normally resistant 129X1/SvJ mice leads to severe placental infection, as well as fetal and maternal deaths. However, the effect of oral infection with S.Tm in pregnant mice and the roles of infection-induced inflammation and cell death pathways in contributing to susceptibility to infection are unclear. Method of Study: Non-pregnant and pregnant C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and cell death pathway-altered mice (IFNAR1−/−, Caspase-1, 11−/−, RIP3−/−) were infected orally with S.Tm. Host survival and fetal resorption were determined. Bacterial burden in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), spleen, liver, and placentas was enumerated at various time points post-infection. Serum cytokine expression was measured through cytometric bead array. Results: Oral infection of WT mice with S.Tm on days 9–10 of gestation resulted in systemic dissemination of the bacteria, substantial placental colonization, and fetal loss 5 days post-infection. Histopathological examination of the placentas indicated that infection-induced widespread focal necrosis and neutrophil infiltration throughout the spongiotrophoblast (SpT) layer. In the non-pregnant state, IFNAR1−/− mice exhibited increased survival following oral S.Tm infection relative to Caspase-1, 11−/−, RIP3−/−, and WT mice. The increased resistance to S.Tm infection in IFNAR1−/− mice was seen during pregnancy as well, with decreased bacterial burden within MLNs, spleen, and placenta, which correlated with the decreased resorptions relative to WT and Caspase-1, 11−/− mice. Conclusion: Oral S.Tm exposure leads to placental infection, inflammation, and resorption, whereas IFNAR1 deficiency enhances host resistance both in the non-pregnant and pregnant states. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

SslE Elicits Functional Antibodies That Impair In Vitro Mucinase Activity and In Vivo Colonization by Both Intestinal and Extraintestinal Escherichia coli Strains,"Nesta B, Valeri M, Spagnuolo A, Rosini R, Mora M, Donato P, Alteri CJ, Del Vecchio M, Buccato S, Pezzicoli A, Bertoldi I, Buzzigoli L, Tuscano G, Falduto M, Rippa V, Ashhab Y, Bensi G, Fontana MR, Seib KL, Mobley HLT, Pizza M, Soriani M, Serino L",2014,Article,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004124,"SslE, the Secreted and surface-associated lipoprotein from Escherichia coli, has recently been associated to the M60-like extracellular zinc-metalloprotease sub-family which is implicated in glycan recognition and processing. SslE can be divided into two main variants and we recently proposed it as a potential vaccine candidate. By applying a number of in vitro bioassays and comparing wild type, knockout mutant and complemented strains, we have now demonstrated that SslE specifically contributes to degradation of mucin substrates, typically present in the intestine and bladder. Mutation of the zinc metallopeptidase motif of SslE dramatically impaired E. coli mucinase activity, confirming the specificity of the phenotype observed. Moreover, antibodies raised against variant I SslE, cloned from strain IHE3034 (SslEIHE3034), are able to inhibit translocation of E. coli strains expressing different variants through a mucin-based matrix, suggesting that SslE induces cross-reactive functional antibodies that affect the metallopeptidase activity. To test this hypothesis, we used well-established animal models and demonstrated that immunization with SslEIHE3034 significantly reduced gut, kidney and spleen colonization by strains producing variant II SslE and belonging to different pathotypes. Taken together, these data strongly support the importance of SslE in E. coli colonization of mucosal surfaces and reinforce the use of this antigen as a component of a broadly protective vaccine against pathogenic E. coli species. © 2014 Nesta et al.","; bacterium antibody; escherichia coli protein; hyaluronate lyase; polysaccharide lyase; ssle protein, e coli; virulence factor; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; antibody production; cba mouse; cell culture; drug effects; enteropathogenic escherichia coli; enzyme activation; escherichia coli; escherichia coli infection; female; growth, development and aging; immunology; intestine; metabolism; microbiology; mouse; outbred strain; animals; animals, outbred strains; antibodies, bacterial; antibody formation; cells, cultured; enteropathogenic escherichia coli; enzyme activation; escherichia coli; escherichia coli infections; escherichia coli proteins; female; intestines; mice; mice, inbred cba; polysaccharide-lyases; virulence factors",No
An oral inoculation infant rabbit model for shigella infection,"Kuehl CJ, D’gama JD, Warr AR, Waldor MK",2020,Article,10.1128/mBio.03105-19,"Shigella species cause diarrheal disease globally. Shigellosis is typically characterized by bloody stools and colitis with mucosal damage and is the leading bacterial cause of diarrheal death worldwide. After the pathogen is orally ingested, it invades and replicates within the colonic epithelium through mechanisms that rely on its type III secretion system (T3SS). Currently, oral infection-based small animal models to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis are lacking. Here, we found that orogastric inoculation of infant rabbits with Shigella flexneri resulted in diarrhea and colonic pathology resembling that found in human shigellosis. Fasting animals prior to S. flexneri inoculation increased the frequency of disease. The pathogen colonized the colon, where both luminal and intraepithelial foci were observed. The intraepithelial foci likely arise through S. flexneri spreading from cell to cell. Robust S. flexneri intestinal colonization, invasion of the colonic epithelium, and epithelial sloughing all required the T3SS as well as IcsA, a factor required for bacterial spreading and adhesion in vitro. Expression of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), detected with in situ mRNA labeling, was higher in animals infected with wild-type S. flexneri versus mutant strains deficient in icsA or T3SS, suggesting that epithelial invasion promotes expression of this chemokine. Collectively, our findings suggest that oral infection of infant rabbits offers a useful experimental model for studies of the pathogenesis of shigellosis and for testing of new therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Shigella species are the leading bacterial cause of diarrheal death globally. The pathogen causes bacillary dysentery, a bloody diarrheal disease characterized by damage to the colonic mucosa and is usually spread through the fecal-oral route. Small animal models of shigellosis that rely on the oral route of infection are lacking. Here, we found that orogastric inoculation of infant rabbits with S. flexneri led to a diarrheal disease and colonic pathology reminiscent of human shigellosis. Diarrhea, intestinal colonization, and pathology in this model were dependent on the S. flexneri type III secretion system and IcsA, canonical Shigella virulence factors. Thus, oral infection of infant rabbits offers a feasible model to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis and to develop and test new therapeutics. © 2020 Kuehl et al.","animal models; bacillary dysentery; host-pathogen interactions; infant rabbit; pathogenesis; shigella; shigellosis; bacterial protein; interleukin 8; protein icsa; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial colonization; bacterium adherence; bacterium mutant; cell invasion; colon epithelium; controlled study; diarrhea; fasting; female; in vitro study; infant; inoculation; intestine epithelium cell; new zealand white (rabbit); nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; shigella flexneri; shigellosis; strain difference; type iii secretion system; wild type; animal; biopsy; disease model; enterobacteriaceae infection; host pathogen interaction; immunohistochemistry; intestine mucosa; leporidae; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; physiology; shigella; animals; biopsy; diarrhea; disease models, animal; enterobacteriaceae infections; host-pathogen interactions; immunohistochemistry; intestinal mucosa; rabbits; shigella",No
TRIF Differentially Regulates Hepatic Steatosis and Inflammation/Fibrosis in Mice,"Yang L, Miura K, Zhang B, Matsushita H, Yang YM, Liang S, Song J, Roh YS, Seki E",2017,Article,10.1016/j.jcmgh.2016.12.004,"Background &amp; Aims Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling is activated through 2 adaptor proteins: MyD88 and TIR-domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). TLR4 and MyD88 are crucial in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. However, the role of TRIF in TLR4-mediated NASH and fibrosis has been elusive. This study investigated the differential roles of TRIF in hepatic steatosis and inflammation/fibrosis. Methods A choline-deficient amino acid defined (CDAA) diet was used for the mouse NASH model. On this diet, the mice develop hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. TLR4 wild-type and TLR4-/- bone marrow chimeric mice and TRIF-/- mice were fed CDAA or a control diet for 22 weeks. Hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis were examined. Results In the CDAA diet–induced NASH, the mice with wild-type bone marrow had higher alanine aminotransferase and hepatic tumor necrosis factor levels than the mice with TLR4-/- bone marrow. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score showed that both wild-type and TLR4-/- bone marrow chimeras had reduced hepatic steatosis, and that both types of chimeras had similar levels of inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning to whole-body wild-type mice. Notably, wild-type recipients showed more liver fibrosis than TLR4-/- recipients. Although TRIF-/- mice showed reduced hepatic steatosis, these mice showed more liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis than wild-type mice. TRIF-/- stellate cells and hepatocytes produced more C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and C-C motif chemokine ligand than wild-type cells in response to lipopolysaccharide. Consistently, TRIF-/- mice showed increased CXCL1 and CCL3 expression along with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, which promotes liver inflammation and injury. Conclusions In TLR4-mediated NASH, different liver cells have distinct roles in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. TRIF promotes hepatic steatosis but it inhibits injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. © 2017 The Authors",hepatocyte apoptosis; lps; neutrophils; tlr4; alanine aminotransferase; alpha smooth muscle actin; collagen; collagen alpha1; cxcl1 chemokine; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; protein; protein bambi; protein timp1; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor adaptor molecule 1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; alanine aminotransferase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bone marrow; chimera; controlled study; hepatitis; liver fibrosis; macrophage; mouse; mouse model; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; protein function,No
The SIRT1 deacetylase protects mice against the symptoms of metabolic syndrome,"Caron AZ, He X, Mottawea W, Seifert EL, Jardine K, Dewar-Darch D, Cron GO, Harper M-E, Stintzi A, McBurney MW",2014,Article,10.1096/fj.13-243568,"Type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and gut dysbiosis are pathophysiological consequences of obesity. Sirtuin (SIRT)-1 is a protein deacetylase implicated in the regulation of metabolic activity. We set out to determine whether the catalytic activity of SIRT1 plays a role in the development of metabolic syndrome, hepatic steatosis, and the distribution of gut microbiota. We challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD) a strain of mice homozygous for a Sirt1 allele carrying a point mutation that ablates the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. When compared to wild-type animals, mice lacking SIRT1 catalytic activity rapidly accumulated excessive hepatic lipid while fed the HFD, an effect evident within 2 wk of HFD feeding. Both white and brown adipose depots became hypertrophic, and the animals developed insulin resistance. The ratio of the major phyla of gut microbiota (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) increased rapidly in the SIRT1-deficient mice after HFD challenge. We conclude that the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 plays an important role in regulating glucose and hepatic lipid homeostasis. In addition, the composition of gut microbiota is influenced by both the animals' Sirt1 genotype and diet composition. © FASEB.","fatty liver; gut microbiota; high-fat diet; glucose; insulin; leptin; sirtuin 1; triacylglycerol; glucose; primer dna; sirt1 protein, mouse; sirtuin 1; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bacteroidetes; bioenergy; brown adipose tissue; catalysis; controlled study; enzyme activity; fatty liver; firmicutes; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; histology; hypertrophy; insulin resistance; intestine flora; lipid diet; lipid homeostasis; lipid liver level; liver homogenate; metabolic syndrome x; mouse; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; white adipose tissue; adipose tissue; animal; energy metabolism; high-fat diet; homeostasis; intestine; liver; metabolism; microbiology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleotide sequence; pathology; fatty liver; gut microbiota; high-fat diet; adipose tissue; animals; base sequence; dna primers; energy metabolism; glucose; homeostasis; intestines; liver; magnetic resonance imaging; metabolic syndrome x; mice; sirtuin 1",No
A novel approach to wildlife transcriptomics provides evidence of disease-mediated differential expression and changes to the microbiome of amphibian populations,"Campbell LJ, Hammond SA, Price SJ, Sharma MD, Garner TWJ, Birol I, Helbing CC, Wilfert L, Griffiths AGF",2018,Article,10.1111/mec.14528,"Ranaviruses are responsible for a lethal, emerging infectious disease in amphibians and threaten their populations throughout the world. Despite this, little is known about how amphibian populations respond to ranaviral infection. In the United Kingdom, ranaviruses impact the common frog (Rana temporaria). Extensive public engagement in the study of ranaviruses in the UK has led to the formation of a unique system of field sites containing frog populations of known ranaviral disease history. Within this unique natural field system, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the gene expression profiles of R. temporaria populations with a history of ranaviral disease and those without. We have applied a RNA read-filtering protocol that incorporates Bloom filters, previously used in clinical settings, to limit the potential for contamination that comes with the use of RNA-Seq in nonlaboratory systems. We have identified a suite of 407 transcripts that are differentially expressed between populations of different ranaviral disease history. This suite contains genes with functions related to immunity, development, protein transport and olfactory reception among others. A large proportion of potential noncoding RNA transcripts present in our differentially expressed set provide first evidence of a possible role for long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in amphibian response to viruses. Our read-filtering approach also removed significantly more bacterial reads from libraries generated from positive disease history populations. Subsequent analysis revealed these bacterial read sets to represent distinct communities of bacterial species, which is suggestive of an interaction between ranavirus and the host microbiome in the wild. © 2018 The Authors.

In Vitro Fermentation of Dietary Carbohydrates Consumed by African Apes and Monkeys: Preliminary Results for Interpreting Microbial and Digestive Strategy,"Lambert JE, Fellner V",2012,Article,10.1007/s10764-011-9559-y,"Primates derive significant nutritional benefits from hosting symbiotic, fermenting microbes in their gut, including the provision of energy from short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We measured fermentation parameters in fecal samples of 4 hindgut fermenting species (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Papio hamadryas, Cercopithecus neglectus) and 1 foregut fermenting species (Colobus guereza) to determine whether differences in SCFA profiles exist between the 2 digestive systems. We analyzed SCFA profiles, culture pH, and methane from fecal samples collected at the North Carolina Zoological Park. Results indicate that the captive individuals exhibit high total SCFA concentrations, with a particularly high acetate-to-propionate ratio. Methane levels were highest in the 2 ape species, and lowest in Colobus guereza and Cercopithecus neglectus. Total SCFA concentrations were similar between wild and captive-born Gorilla gorilla, although concentrations of acetate were significantly greater -and butyrate concentration and methane production significantly lower- in wild-caught gorillas relative to captive-born. These results are consistent with data on diet and digestive retention times among Catarrhini and have implications for our understanding of the interactions among diet, body mass, digestion, and how monogastric cercopithecines can consume either similar or greater levels of fiber than larger-bodied apes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",cercopithecinae; colobinae; colobus; diet; gorilla; nutritional ecology; pan; papio; short-chain fatty acids; acetate; body mass; captive population; carbohydrate; concentration (composition); diet; digestion; fatty acid; feces; feeding ecology; fermentation; food consumption; host-symbiont interaction; methane; national park; ph; primate; north carolina; united states; catarrhini; cercopithecinae; cercopithecus; cercopithecus neglectus; colobinae; colobus; colobus guereza; gorilla gorilla; haplorhini; pan troglodytes; papio; papio hamadryas; primates,No

We have analyzed its production in human tissues using a comprehensive microarray database. Its highest expression is in the salivary gland, indicating that it is an important component of saliva. It is also expressed in the trachea, bronchus, and in the mammary gland upon onset of lactation. We have also characterized a Ccl28 -/- mouse that exhibits very low IgA levels in milk, and the IgA levels in feces are also reduced. These observations confirm a role for the CCL28/CCR10 chemokine axis in the recruitment of IgA plasmablasts to the lactating mammary gland. CCL28 is also expressed in the vomeronasal organ. We also detected olfactory defects (anosmia) in a Ccl28 -/- mouse suggesting that CCL28 is involved in the function/development of olfaction. Importantly, Ccl28 -/- mice are highly susceptible to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in an acute model of infection, indicating that CCL28 plays a major role in innate immunity against Salmonella in the gut. Finally, microbiome studies revealed modest differences in the gut microbiota between Ccl28 -/- mice and their cohoused wild-type littermates. The latter observation suggests that under homeostatic conditions, CCL28 plays a limited role in shaping the gut microbiome. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","chemokines; gut; innate immunity; salmonella; vomeronasal organ; ccl28 chemokine; chemokine; chemokine receptor ccr10; immunoglobulin a; unclassified drug; beta chemokine; ccl28 protein, mouse; immunoglobulin a; adaptive immunity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anosmia; article; colony forming unit; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; host resistance; human; human tissue; infection resistance; innate immunity; intestine flora; intestine infection; male; mammary gland; mouse; mucosal immunity; nasal tissue; nonhuman; plasmablast; priority journal; salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium; salmonellosis; smelling; vomeronasal organ; animal; animal salmonellosis; c57bl mouse; homeostasis; immunology; innate immunity; knockout mouse; microbiology; mucosal immunity; odor; physiology; salmonella enterica; adaptive immunity; animals; chemokines, cc; gastrointestinal microbiome; homeostasis; immunity, innate; immunity, mucosal; immunoglobulin a; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; salmonella enterica; salmonella infections, animal; smell",No

Previously, we found that Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 can protect intestinal barrier functions in mice inflammation model. Here, we investigated its mechanism of action. Our results show that CNCM I-3690 can (i) physically maintain modulated goblet cells and the mucus layer and (ii) counteract changes in local and systemic lymphocytes. Furthermore, mice colonic transcriptome analysis revealed that CNCM I-3690 enhances the expression of genes related to healthy gut permeability: motility and absorption, cell proliferation; and protective functions by inhibiting endogenous proteases. Finally, SpaFED pili are clearly important effectors since an L. rhamnosus ΔspaF mutant failed to provide the same benefits as the wild type strain. Taken together, our data suggest that CNCM I-3690 restores impaired intestinal barrier functions via anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective responses. © 2019, The Author(s).","; 1 fluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene; 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene sulfonic acid; probiotic agent; protective agent; animal; caco-2 cell line; cell protection; colon; drug effect; gene expression profiling; genetics; goblet cell; hek293 cell line; ht-29 cell line; human; inflammation; intestine; intestine mucosa; lactobacillus rhamnosus; metabolism; microbiology; mouse; mucus; mutation; pathology; permeability; physiology; procedures; animals; caco-2 cells; colon; cytoprotection; dinitrofluorobenzene; gene expression profiling; goblet cells; hek293 cells; ht29 cells; humans; inflammation; intestinal mucosa; intestines; lactobacillus rhamnosus; mice; mucus; mutation; permeability; probiotics; protective agents",No
Reciprocal interactions between nematodes and their microbial environments,"Midha A, Schlosser J, Hartmann S",2017,Article,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00144,"Parasitic nematode infections are widespread in nature, affecting humans as well as wild, companion, and livestock animals. Most parasitic nematodes inhabit the intestines of their hosts living in close contact with the intestinal microbiota. Many species also have tissue migratory life stages in the absence of severe systemic inflammation of the host. Despite the close coexistence of helminths with numerous microbes, little is known concerning these interactions. While the environmental niche is considerably different, the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is also found amongst a diverse microbiota, albeit on decaying organic matter. As a very well characterized model organism that has been intensively studied for several decades, C. elegans interactions with bacteria are much more deeply understood than those of their parasitic counterparts. The enormous breadth of understanding achieved by the C. elegans research community continues to inform many aspects of nematode parasitology. Here, we summarize what is known regarding parasitic nematode-bacterial interactions while comparing and contrasting this with information from work in C. elegans. This review highlights findings concerning responses to bacterial stimuli, antimicrobial peptides, and the reciprocal influences between nematodes and their environmental bacteria. Furthermore, the microbiota of nematodes as well as alterations in the intestinal microbiota of mammalian hosts by helminth infections are discussed.","antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial peptides; helminth; microbiota; nematode; cecropin; lectin; lysozyme; polypeptide antibiotic agent; antibacterial activity; antibiotic resistance; article; ascaris lumbricoides; caenorhabditis elegans; corynebacterium; corynebacterium diphtheriae; cunninghamella elegans; heligmosomoides bakeri; helminthiasis; human; immunosurveillance; inflammation; innate immunity; intestine flora; intestine parasite; microbial colonization; microbial community; micrococcus luteus; microorganism detection; nematode; nonhuman; organismal interaction; parasitology; pig; prevotella; signal transduction; streptococcus; trichuris muris; trichuris trichiura; animal; bacterial phenomena and functions; biodiversity; biological model; classification; drug effects; environmental microbiology; feces; helminth; host parasite interaction; immunology; intestine; microbiology; nematode; physiology; animals; bacterial physiological phenomena; biodiversity; caenorhabditis elegans; drug resistance, microbial; environmental microbiology; feces; gastrointestinal microbiome; helminthiasis; helminths; host-parasite interactions; humans; intestines; models, biological; nematoda; signal transduction",No
"Omics-based investigation of diet-induced obesity synergized with HBx, Src, and p53 mutation accelerating hepatocarcinogenesis in zebrafish model","Yang W-Y, Rao P-S, Luo Y-C, Lin H-K, Huang S-H, Yang J-M, Yuh C-H",2019,Article,10.3390/cancers11121899,"The primary type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has been associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, diabetes, and obesity. Previous studies have identified some genetic risk factors, such as hepatitis B virus X antigens, overexpression of SRC oncogene, and mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene; however, the synergism between diet and genetic risk factors is still unclear. To investigate the synergism between diet and genetic risk factors in hepatocarcinogenesis, we used zebrafish with four genetic backgrounds and overfeeding or high-fat-diet-induced obesity with an omics-based expression of genes and histopathological changes. The results show that overfeeding and high-fat diet can induce obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in wild-type fish. In HBx, Src (p53-) triple transgenic zebrafish, diet-induced obesity accelerated HCC formation at five months of age and increased the cancer incidence threefold. We developed a global omics data analysis method to investigate genes, pathways, and biological systems based on microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS, RNA-seq) omics data of zebrafish with four diet and genetic risk factors. The results show that two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) systems, metabolism and genetic information processing, as well as the pathways of fatty acid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis, are activated during hepatocarcinogenesis. This study provides a systematic view of the synergism between genetic and diet factors in the dynamic liver cancer formation process, and indicate that overfeeding or a high-fat diet and the risk genes have a synergistic effect in causing liver cancer by affecting fatty acid metabolism and ribosome biogenesis. © 2019 by the authors.

In addition to being resistant to extreme living environments for extended periods, its endophytic spores are implicated in inhibiting cancer cell growth. We speculated that C. tyrobutyricum spores can also promote gut health, which mean it can maintain intestinal homeostasis. To date, the beneficial effects of C. tyrobutyricum spores on gut health have not been reported. In this study, a Spo0Aoverexpressing C. tyrobutyricum strain was developed to increase spore production, and its probiotic effects on the gut were assessed. Compared with the wild-type, the engineered strain showed significantly increased sporulation rates. Mice administered with the engineered strain exhibited enhanced intestinal villi and the villus height/crypt depth ratio, weight gain and improved Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio to facilitate intestinal homeostasis.

"Lactobacilli and other gastrointestinal microbiota of Peromyscus leucopus, reservoir host for agents of Lyme disease and other zoonoses in North America","Milovic A, Bassam K, Shao H, Chatzistamou I, Tufts DM, Diuk-Wasser M, Barbour AG",2020,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0231801,"The cricetine rodent Peromyscus leucopus is an important reservoir for several human zoonoses, including Lyme disease, in North America. Akin to hamsters, the white-footed deermouse has been unevenly characterized in comparison to the murid Mus musculus. To further understanding of P. leucopus’ total genomic content, we investigated gut microbiomes of an outbred colony of P. leucopus, inbred M. musculus, and a natural population of P. leucopus. Metagenome and whole genome sequencing were combined with microbiology and microscopy approaches. A focus was the genus Lactobacillus, four diverse species of which were isolated from forestomach and feces of colony P. leucopus. Three of the species—L. animalis, L. reuteri, and provisionally-named species “L. peromysci”—were identified in fecal metagenomes of wild P. leucopus but not discernibly in samples from M. musculus. L. johnsonii, the fourth species, was common in M. musculus but absent or sparse in wild P. leucopus. Also identified in both colony and natural populations were a Helicobacter sp. in feces but not stomach, and a Tritrichomonas sp. protozoan in cecum or feces. The gut metagenomes of colony P. leucopus were similar to those of colony M. musculus at the family or higher level and for major subsystems. But there were multiple differences between species and sexes within each species in their gut metagenomes at orthologous gene level. These findings provide a foundation for hypothesis-testing of functions of individual microbial species and for interventions, such as bait vaccines based on an autochthonous bacterium and targeting P. leucopus for transmission-blocking. © 2020 Milovic et al.

Graft-versus-host disease is independent of innate signaling pathways triggered by pathogens in host hematopoietic cells,"Li H, Matte-Martone C, Tan HS, Venkatesan S, McNiff J, Demetris AJ, Jain D, Lakkis F, Rothstein D, Shlomchik WD",2011,Article,10.4049/jimmunol.1002965,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is initiated by APCs that prime alloreactive donor T cells. In antipathogen responses, Ag-bearing APCs receive signals through pattern-recognition receptors, including TLRs, which induce the expression of costimulatory molecules and production of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn mold the adaptive T cell response. However, in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), there is no specific pathogen, alloantigen is ubiquitous, and signals that induce APC maturation are undefined. To investigate APC activation in GVHD, we used recipient mice with hematopoietic cells genetically deficient in pathways critical for APC maturation in models in which host APCs are absolutely required. Strikingly, CD8-mediated and CD4-mediated GVHD were similar whether host APCs were wild-type or deficient in MyD88, TRIF, or MyD88 and TRIF, which excludes essential roles for TLRs and IL-1β, the key product of inflammasome activation. Th1 differentiation was if anything augmented when APCs were MyD88/TRIF -/-, and T cell production of IFN-γ did not require host IL-12. GVHD was also intact when APCs lacked the type I IFNR, which amplifies APC activation pathways that induce type I IFNs. Thus in GVHD, alloreactive T cells can be activated when pathways critical for antipathogen T cell responses are impaired.

Effects of the captive and wild environment on diversity of the gut microbiome of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus),"Schmidt E, Mykytczuk N, Schulte-Hostedde AI",2019,Article,10.1038/s41396-019-0345-8,"Vertebrate gastrointestinal tracts have co-existed with microbes over millennia. These microbial communities provide their host with numerous benefits. However, the extent to which different environmental factors contribute to the assemblage of gut microbial communities is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how the external environment influences the development of gut microbiome communities (GMCs). Faecal samples were collected from deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) born and raised in captivity and the wild at approximately 3–5 weeks of age. Additional samples were collected 2 weeks later, with a subset of individuals being translocated between captive and wild environments. Microbial data were analysed using 16S rRNA next-generation Illumina HiSeq sequencing methods. GMCs of deer mice were more similar between neighbours who shared the same environment, regardless of where an individual was born, demonstrating that GMCs are significantly influenced by the surrounding environment and can rapidly change over time. Mice in natural environments contained more diverse GMCs with higher relative abundances of Ruminoccocaceae, Helicobacteraceae and Lachnospiraceae spp. Future studies should examine the fitness consequences associated with the presence/absence of microbes that are characteristic of GMCs of wild populations to gain a better understanding of environment–microbe–host evolutionary and ecological relationships. © 2019, International Society for Microbial Ecology.","; captive population; environmental factor; fitness; genetic analysis; microbial activity; microorganism; relative abundance; rna; rodent; species diversity; wild population; helicobacteraceae; lachnospiraceae; mus; peromyscus; peromyscus maniculatus; vertebrata; animal; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; ecosystem; evolution; feces; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; intestine flora; isolation and purification; microbiology; mouse; peromyscus; phylogeny; physiology; wild animal; animals; animals, wild; bacteria; biodiversity; biological evolution; ecosystem; feces; gastrointestinal microbiome; gastrointestinal tract; mice; peromyscus; phylogeny",Yes
Correlates of maternal glucocorticoid levels in a socially flexible rodent,"Pinho GM, Ortiz-Ross X, Reese AN, Blumstein DT",2019,Article,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2019.104577,"While it is generally accepted that social isolation has detrimental effects on social species, little is known about the importance of social interactions in less social species–particularly for wild reproductive females. We studied socially-flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked whether features of the social environment are associated with maternal fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations. Since changes in maternal baseline glucocorticoids may have positive or negative consequences for offspring fitness, we were also interested in estimating their relationship with measures of reproductive success. We fitted generalized linear mixed effects models to a dataset including maternal FGM measurements, social network metrics, maternal/alloparental care, and pup FGM and survival. Agonistic interactions were positively associated with maternal FGM levels, while mothers that engaged in relatively more affiliative interactions had reduced FGM levels when living in environments with low predator pressure. Pups associated with mothers exhibiting high FGM levels had low annual survival rates, received less maternal/alloparental care and had higher FGM levels. Interestingly, offspring from mothers with high FGM levels were more likely to survive the summer when born in small litters. In sum, social interactions likely influence and are influenced by glucocorticoid levels of facultatively social females. Potential benefits of social bonds may be context-specific, and agonistic interactions may be tightly correlated with fitness. Female marmots exhibiting high FGM levels had overall low reproductive success, which is predicted by the cort-fitness hypothesis. However, under adverse conditions, offspring summer survival can be maximized if pups are born in small litters. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","cort-fitness hypothesis; glucocorticoid hormones; marmot; network metrics; reproductive success; social behavior; social stress; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid; animal experiment; article; correlation analysis; feces level; female; litter size; marmota; marmota flaviventer; maternal care; mother; nonhuman; parental behavior; predator stress; priority journal; reproductive success; rodent; social behavior; social bonding; social environment; social interaction; social network; summer; survival rate; aggression; animal; chemistry; feces; male; maternal behavior; metabolism; mother; newborn; physiology; reproduction; rodent; aggression; animals; animals, newborn; feces; female; glucocorticoids; litter size; male; marmota; maternal behavior; mothers; reproduction; rodentia; social behavior",No

In this study, we modified the gut microbiota of the insect Tenebrio molitor by rearing larvae in soil sampled from the field. We showed by high throughput sequencing methods that this treatment modifies the gut microbiota so that it is more diversified than that of laboratory-reared insects, and closely resembled the one of soil-dwelling insects. To describe what the entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus (Enterobacteriaceae), vectored by the soil-dwelling nematode Steinernema, might experience in natural conditions, we studied the infestation of the soil-reared T. molitor larvae with three Steinernema-Xenorhabdus pairs. We performed the infestation at 18°C, which delays the emergence of new infective juveniles (IJs), the soil-dwelling nematode forms, but which is a temperature compatible with natural infestation. We analyzed by high throughput sequencing methods the composition of the bacterial community within the insect cadavers before the first emergences of IJs.

IgA Response to Symbiotic Bacteria as a Mediator of Gut Homeostasis,"Peterson DA, McNulty NP, Guruge JL, Gordon JI",2007,Article,10.1016/j.chom.2007.09.013,"Colonization of germ-free mice with a normal gut microbiota elicits bacteria-specific IgA antibody responses. The effects of these responses on microbial and host biology remain poorly defined. Therefore, we developed a gnotobiotic mouse model where the microbiota is reduced to one bacterial species, and the antibody repertoire to a single, monoclonal IgA against the bacterium's capsular polysaccharide. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was introduced into germ-free wild-type, immunodeficient Rag1-/-, or Rag1-/- mice harboring IgA-producing hybridoma cells. Without IgA, B. thetaiotaomicron elicits a more robust innate immune response and reacts to this response by inducing genes that metabolize host oxidative products. IgA reduces intestinal proinflammatory signaling and bacterial epitope expression, thereby balancing suppression of the oxidative burst with the antibody's negative impact on bacterial fitness. These results underscore the adaptive immune system's critical role in establishing a sustainable host-microbial relationship.

Slow Lorises (Nycticebus spp.) Really Are Slow: a Study of Food Passage Rates,"Cabana F, Dierenfeld E, Wirdateti W, Donati G, Nekaris KAI",2017,Article,10.1007/s10764-017-9986-5,"The characteristics of food ingested by a primate affect its assimilation of energy by modulating food passage rate. In general, digestive time increases in folivorous primates and decreases in frugivorous primates when they are fed higher fiber diets but this relationship is understudied in exudativorous primates. We compared the food passage rate of five slow loris species. We studied 34 wild-caught slow lorises (15 Nycticebus coucang, 15 N. javanicus, and 4 N. menegensis) in an Indonesian rescue center and four captive-born slow lorises (2 N. bengalensis and 2 N. pygmaeus) in a UK institution. We fed the Indonesian subjects two different diets: a captive-type diet comprising fruits, vegetables, and insects and a wild-type diet formulated to be similar in nutrients to that consumed by slow lorises in the wild, consisting of gum, insects, vegetables, and nectar. We fed the UK subjects a diet of gum, vegetables, insects, and hard-boiled eggs. We formulated this diet to mimic the wild diet, with notably higher fiber fractions and lower soluble sugars than the previous diet. We measured two variables: the transit time (TT) and the mean retention time (MRT). We mixed 1 tsp. of glitter in bananas or gum as our markers and fed them to the slow lorises immediately before their main diet. We noted the date and time of feeding and of appearances of the marker in feces. We weighed food given and left over for each individual to calculate ingested foods and nutrients. We found that TTs were not affected by diet treatment but MRTs were significantly longer for all species fed the wild-type diet. Our results show that Nycticebus spp. have long MRTs for their body weight, and N. pygmdaeus may have the slowest MRT of all primates in relation to body mass. The digestive flexibility of exudativorous primates should allow them to maximize fermentation opportunities when they ingest more (appropriate) fiber by increasing the amount of time the fiber substrate stays in the large intestine. Exudativorous primates appear to have plastic digestive strategies that may be an adaptation to cope with relatively nutrient-poor staple food sources such as gum. The provision of gum in a captive setting may therefore provide benefits for gut health in slow lorises. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",diet; exudativory; gum; mean retention time; primate; transit time; assimilation efficiency; body mass; dietary intake; digestibility; feeding; food intake; frugivory; ingestion rate; primate; temporal analysis; wild population; indonesia; united kingdom; hexapoda; nycticebus; nycticebus bengalensis; nycticebus coucang; nycticebus pygmaeus; primates,No
Addition of antifungal skin bacteria to salamanders ameliorates the effects of chytridiomycosis,"Harris RN, Lauer A, Simon MA, Banning JL, Alford RA",2009,Article,10.3354/dao02004,"Chytridiomycosis, caused by the skin fungus Batrachochytnum dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused population declines of many amphibians in remote protected habitats. Progress has been made in understanding the pathogen's life cycle, documenting its devastating effects on individual amphibians and on populations, and understanding how and why disease outbreaks occur. No research has directly addressed the critical question of how to prevent declines and extinctions caused by outbreaks of the disease. We have identified a number of bacterial species of amphibian skin that inhibit Bd in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that a species of anti-Bd skin bacteria can be successfully added to skins of salamanders Plethodon cinereus, and that addition of this bacterium reduced the severity of a disease symptom in experimentally infected individuals. This is the first demonstration that manipulating the natural skin microbiota of an amphibian species can alter the pathogen's negative effects on infected amphibians and appears to be the first demonstration that an epibiotic manipulation of any wildlife species can lessen the effects of an emerging infectious disease. It suggests that probiotic or bio-augmentation manipulations of cutaneous microbiota could have the potential to reduce susceptibility of amphibians to the disease in nature. This is the first approach suggested that could slow or halt epidemic outbreaks and allow successful reintroductions of amphibian species that have become locally or globally extinct in the wild. Our results also suggest a mechanism for the association of climate change and the likelihood of chytridiomycosis outbreaks via the effects of the former on antifungal bacterial communities. © Inter-Research 2009.",amphibian declines; batrachochytnum dendrobatidis; beneficial bacteria; chytridiomycosis; probiotics; amphibian; bacterium; disease severity; disease spread; epibiont; fungal disease; fungicide; inhibition; population decline; probiotics; skin; amphibia; animal; animal disease; article; chytridiomycetes; microbiology; mycosis; physiology; pseudomonas; skin; animals; chytridiomycota; mycoses; pseudomonas; skin; urodela; amphibia; bacteria (microorganisms); fungi; plethodon cinereus; salamandroidea,No
Intestinal epithelial Toll-like receptor 4 prevents metabolic syndrome by regulating interactions between microbes and intestinal epithelial cells in mice,"Lu P, Sodhi CP, Yamaguchi Y, Jia H, Prindle T, Fulton WB, Vikram A, Bibby KJ, Morowitz MJ, Hackam DJ",2018,Article,10.1038/mi.2017.114,"Little is known about the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, although Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been implicated. We investigated whether TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium regulates metabolic syndrome by coordinating interactions between the luminal microbiota and host genes that regulate metabolism. Mice lacking TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium (TLR4 ""IEC), but not mice lacking TLR4 in myeloid cells nor mice lacking TLR4 globally, developed metabolic syndrome; these features were not observed in TLR4 ""IEC mice given antibiotics. Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota revealed differences between TLR4 ""IEC and wild-type mice, while meta-transcriptome analysis of the microbiota showed that intestinal TLR4 affected the expression of microbial genes involved in the metabolism of lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides. Genes regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and the antimicrobial peptide lysozyme were significantly downregulated in TLR4 ""IEC mice, suggesting a mechanism by which intestinal TLR4 could exert its effects on the microbiota and metabolic syndrome. Supportingly, antibiotics prevented both downregulation of PPAR genes and the development of metabolic syndrome, while PPAR agonists prevented development of metabolic syndrome in TLR4 ""IEC mice.

"Identification of Key Pro-Survival Proteins in Isolated Colonic Goblet Cells of Winnie, a Murine Model of Spontaneous Colitis","Wilson R, Gundamaraju R, Vemuri R, Angelucci C, Geraghty D, Gueven N, Eri RD",2020,Article,10.1093/ibd/izz179,"Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that the goblet cell-derived mucin-2 (Muc2) is a major component of the immune system and that perturbations in Muc2 lead to an ulcerative colitis-like phenotype. The animal model Winnie carries a missense mutation in Muc2 that causes Muc2 misfolding, accumulation in goblet cells, and ER stress. Excessive ER stress is a hallmark of many diseases, including ulcerative colitis, cancer, diabetes and Parkinson's disease. However, rather than committing to cell death, which is the typical outcome of unresolved ER stress, Winnie goblet cells are characterized by hyperproliferation, suggesting additional regulation of this cellular stress response. Methods: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ulcerative colitis in the Winnie model, we isolated goblet cells from Winnie and wild-type mice and used label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics to understand the functional consequences of Muc2 misfolding and accumulation. Results: A large number of changes were identified that highlight a dramatic reprogramming of energy production, including enhanced utilization of butyrate, a key energy source of colonic cells. A major finding was the marked upregulation of the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain proteins Chchd2, Chchd3, and Chchd6. In particular, we identified and confirmed the upregulation and nuclear translocation of Chchd2, a protein known to inhibit oxidative stress induced apoptosis. Conclusions: This study is the first to apply proteome-level analysis to the preclinical Winnie model of ulcerative colitis. Identification of proteins and pathways affected in isolated Winnie goblet cells provides evidence for novel adaptive mechanisms underlying cell survival under conditions of chronic ER stress. © 2019 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

Distinct effects of milk-Derived and fermented dairy protein on gut microbiota and cardiometabolic markers in diet-Induced obese mice,"Perazza LR, Daniel N, Dubois M-J, Pilon G, Varin TV, Blais M, Martinez Gonzales JL, Bouchard M, Asselin C, Lessard M, Pouliot Y, Roy D, Marette A",2020,Article,10.1093/jn/nxaa217,"Background: Recent meta-analyses suggest that the consumption of fermented dairy products reduces type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Objective: We evaluated whether dairy protein products modulated gut microbiota and cardiometabolic features in mouse models of diet-induced obesity and CVD. Methods: Eight-week-old C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and LDLr−/−ApoB100/100 (LRKO) male mice were fed for 12 and 24 wk, respectively, with a high-fat/high-sucrose diet [66% kcal lipids, 22% kcal carbohydrates (100% sucrose), 12% kcal proteins]. The protein sources of the 4 diets were 100% nondairy protein (NDP), or 50% of the NDP energy replaced by milk (MP), milk fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus (FMP), or Greek-style yogurt (YP) protein. Fecal 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing, intestinal gene expression, and glucose tolerance test were conducted. Hepatic inflammation and circulating adhesion molecules were measured by multiplex assays. Results: Feeding WT mice for 12 wk led to a 74% increase in body weight, whereas after 24 wk the LRKO mice had a 101.5% increase compared with initial body weight. Compared with NDP and MP, the consumption of FMP and YP modulated the gut microbiota composition in a similar clustering pattern, upregulating the Streptococcus genus in both genotypes. In WT mice, feeding YP compared with NDP increased the expression of genes involved in jejunal (Reg3b, 7.3-fold, P = 0.049) and ileal (Ocln, 1.7-fold, P = 0.047; Il1-β,1.7-fold, P = 0.038; Nos2, 3.8-fold, P = 0.018) immunity and integrity. In LRKO mice, feeding YP compared with MP improved insulin sensitivity by 65% (P = 0.039). In LRKO mice, feeding with FMP versus NDP attenuated hepatic inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, 2.1-fold, P &lt; 0.0001; IL1-β, 5.7-fold, P = 0.0003; INF-γ, 1.7-fold, P = 0.002) whereas both FMP [vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), 1.3-fold, P= 0.0003] and YP (VCAM1, 1.04-fold, P= 0.013; intracellular adhesion molecule 1, 1.4-fold, P= 0.028) decreased circulating adhesion molecules.

NOD1 activators link innate immunity to insulin resistance,"Schertzer JD, Tamrakar AK, Magalhães JG, Pereira S, Bilan PJ, Fullerton MD, Liu Z, Steinberg GR, Giacca A, Philpott DJ, Klip A",2011,Article,10.2337/db11-0004,"OBJECTIVE - Insulin resistance associates with chronic inflammation, and participatory elements of the immune system are emerging. We hypothesized that bacterial elements acting on distinct intracellular pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, such as bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) acting on nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins, contribute to insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Metabolic and inflammatory properties were assessed in wild-type (WT) and NOD1/2-/- double knockout mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Insulin resistance was measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps in mice injected with mimetics of mesodiaminopimelic acid-containing PGN or the minimal bioactive PGN motif, which activate NOD1 and NOD2, respectively. Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in NOD ligand-injected mice. Cytokine secretion, glucose uptake, and insulin signaling were assessed in adipocytes and primary hepatocytes exposed to NOD ligands in vitro. RESULTS - NOD1/2-/- mice were protected from HFD-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and peripheral insulin intolerance. Conversely, direct activation of NOD1 protein caused insulin resistance. NOD1 ligands induced peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance within 6 h in WT, but not NOD1-/-, mice. NOD2 ligands only modestly reduced peripheral glucose disposal. NOD1 ligand elicited minor changes in circulating proinflammatory mediators, yet caused adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance of muscle AS160 and liver FOXO1. Ex vivo, NOD1 ligand caused proinflammatory cytokine secretion and impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake directly in adipocytes. NOD1 ligand also caused inflammation and insulin resistance directly in primary hepatocytes from WT, but not NOD1-/-, mice. CONCLUSIONS - We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance. Acute activation of NOD proteins by mimetics of bacterial PGNs causes whole-body insulin resistance, bolstering the concept that innate immune responses to distinctive bacterial cues directly lead to insulin resistance. Hence, NOD1 is a plausible, new link between innate immunity and metabolism. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.","; autacoid; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; caspase recruitment domain protein 4; cytokine; transcription factor fkhr; adipocyte; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; glucose transport; inflammation; innate immunity; insulin resistance; liver; liver cell; mouse; muscle; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; adipose tissue; animals; avian proteins; cytokines; dietary fats; forkhead transcription factors; glucose clamp technique; immunity, innate; inflammation; insulin resistance; mice; mice, knockout; nod1 signaling adaptor protein; nod2 signaling adaptor protein; phosphorylation; signal transduction",No
Microbial Colonization in Adulthood Shapes the Intestinal Macrophage Compartment,"Schmidt F, Dahlke K, Batra A, Keye J, Wu H, Friedrich M, Glauben R, Ring C, Loh G, Schaubeck M, Hackl H, Trajanoski Z, Schumann M, Kühl AA, Blaut M, Siegmund B",2019,Article,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjz036,"Background and Aims: Contact with distinct microbiota early in life has been shown to educate the mucosal immune system, hence providing protection against immune-mediated diseases. However, the impact of early versus late colonization with regard to the development of the intestinal macrophage compartment has not been studied so far. Methods: Germ-free mice were colonized with specific-pathogen-free [SPF] microbiota at the age of 5 weeks. The ileal and colonic macrophage compartment were analysed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing 1 and 5 weeks after colonization and in age-matched SPF mice, which had had contact with microbiota since birth. To evaluate the functional differences, dextran sulfate sodium [DSS]-induced colitis was induced, and barrier function analyses were undertaken. Results: Germ-free mice were characterized by an atrophied intestinal wall and a profoundly reduced number of ileal macrophages. Strikingly, morphological restoration of the intestine occurred within the first week after colonization. In contrast, ileal macrophages required 5 weeks for complete restoration, whereas colonic macrophages were numerically unaffected. However, following DSS exposure, the presence of microbiota was a prerequisite for colonic macrophage infiltration. One week after colonization, mild colonic inflammation was observed, paralleled by a reduced inflammatory response after DSS treatment, in comparison with SPF mice. This attenuated inflammation was paralleled by a lack of TNFα production of LPS-stimulated colonic macrophages from SPF and colonized mice, suggesting desensitization of colonized mice by the colonization itself. Conclusions: This study provides the first data indicating that after colonization of adult mice, the numeric, phenotypic, and functional restoration of the macrophage compartment requires the presence of intestinal microbiota and is time dependent. © 2019 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Dietary supplementation with spray-dried porcine plasma attenuates colon inflammation in a genetic mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease,"Miró L, Amat C, Rosell-Cardona C, Campbell JM, Polo J, Pérez-Bosque A, Moretó M",2020,Article,10.3390/ijms21186760,"Dietary supplementation with spray-dried porcine plasma (SDP) can modulate the immune response of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. SDP supplementation reduces acute mucosal inflammation, as well as chronic inflammation associated with aging. The aim of this study was to analyze if SDP supplementation could ameliorate colitis in a genetic mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Wild-type mice and Mdr1a knockout (KO) mice were administered a control diet or an SDP-supplemented diet from day 21 (weaning) until day 56. The histopathological index, epithelial barrier, and intestinal immune system were analyzed in the colonic mucosa. KO mice had higher epithelial permeability, increased Muc1 and Muc4 expression, and lower abundance of E-cadherin and Muc2 (all p < 0.001). SDP prevented these effects (all p < 0.05) and decreased the colonic inflammation observed in KO mice, reducing neutrophil and monocyte infiltration and activation and the percentage of activated T helper lymphocytes in the colonic mucosa (all p < 0.05). SDP also diminished proinflammatory cytokine expression and increased the anti-inflammatory IL-10 concentration in the colonic mucosa (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with SDP enhances colon barrier function and reduces mucosal inflammation in a mouse model of IBD. © 2020 by the authors.

The impact of sampling season and catching site (Wild and aquaculture) on gut microbiota composition and diversity of nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus),"Bereded NK, Abebe GB, Fanta SW, Curto M, Waidbacher H, Meimberg H, Domig KJ",2021,Article,10.3390/biology10030180,"The gut microbiota of fishes is known to play an essential role in diverse aspects of host biology. The gut microbiota of fish is affected by various environmental parameters, including temperature changes, salinity and diet. Studies of effect of environment on gut microbiota enables to have a further understanding of what comprises a healthy microbiota under different environmental conditions. However, there is insufficient understanding regarding the effects of sampling season and catching site (wild and aquaculture) on the gut microbiota of Nile tilapia. This study characterised gut microbial composition and diversity from samples collected from Lake Tana and the Bahir Dar aquaculture facility centre using 16S rDNA Illumina MiSeq platform sequencing. Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were the most dominant phyla in the Lake Tana samples, while Pro-teobacteria was the most dominant in the aquaculture samples. The results of differential abundance testing clearly indicated significant differences for Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria across sampling months. However, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria were significantly enriched in the comparison of samples from the Lake Tana and aquaculture centre. Significant differences were observed in microbial diversity across sam‐ pling months and between wild and captive Nile tilapia. The alpha diversity clearly showed that samples from the aquaculture centre (captive) had a higher diversity than the wild Nile tilapia samples from Lake Tana. The core gut microbiota of all samples of Nile tilapia used in our study comprised Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. This study clearly showed the impact of sampling season and catching site (wild and aquaculture) on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities associated with the gut of Nile tilapia. Overall, this is the first study on the effects of sampling season and catching site on the gut microbiota of Nile tilapia in Ethiopia. Future work is recommended to precisely explain the causes of these changes using large representative samples of Nile tilapia from different lakes and aquaculture farms. © 2021 by the authors.

ERAP1 deficient mice have reduced Type 1 regulatory T cells and develop skeletal and intestinal features of Ankylosing Spondylitis,"Pepelyayeva Y, Rastall DPW, Aldhamen YA, O’Connell P, Raehtz S, Alyaqoub FS, Blake MK, Raedy AM, Angarita AM, Abbas AM, Pereira-Hicks CN, Roosa SG, McCabe L, Amalfitano A",2018,Article,10.1038/s41598-018-30159-5,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a prototypical sero-negative autoimmune disease that affects millions worldwide. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) gene have been linked to AS via GWAS studies, however, the exact mechanism as to how ERAP1 contributes to pathogenesis of AS is not understood. We undertook µCT imaging and histologic analysis to evaluate bone morphology of the axial skeletons of ERAP1−/− mice and discovered the hallmark skeletal features of AS in these mice, including spinal ankylosis, osteoporosis, and spinal inflammation. We also confirmed the presence of spontaneous intestinal dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in ERAP1−/− mice, however the transfer of healthy microbiota from wild type mice via cross-fostering experiments did not resolve the skeletal phenotypes of ERAP1−/− mice. Immunological analysis demonstrated that while ERAP1−/− mice had normal numbers of peripheral Foxp3+ Tregs, they had reduced numbers of both “Tr1-like” regulatory T cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells, which are important for Tr1 cell differentiation. Together, our data suggests that ERAP1−/− mice may serve as a useful animal model for studying pathogenesis of intestinal, skeletal, and immunological manifestations of Ankylosing Spondylitis. © 2018, The Author(s).","; aminopeptidase; erap1 protein, mouse; forkhead transcription factor; minor histocompatibility antigen; animal; ankylosing spondylitis; c57bl mouse; colitis; dysbiosis; genetic predisposition; genetics; immunology; inflammation; knockout mouse; male; mouse; phenotype; regulatory t lymphocyte; single nucleotide polymorphism; aminopeptidases; animals; colitis; dysbiosis; forkhead transcription factors; genetic predisposition to disease; inflammation; male; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; minor histocompatibility antigens; phenotype; polymorphism, single nucleotide; spondylitis, ankylosing; t-lymphocytes, regulatory",No
Anhedonia induced by high-fat diet in mice depends on gut microbiota and leptin,"Hassan AM, Mancano G, Kashofer K, Liebisch G, Farzi A, Zenz G, Claus SP, Holzer P",2020,Article,10.1080/1028415X.2020.1751508,"Objectives: Imbalanced nutrition and obesity are risk factors for depression, a relationship that in rodents can be modeled by depression-like behavior in response to high-fat diet (HFD). In this work, we examined the role of the intestinal microbiota and the adipocytokine leptin as potential mediators of the effects of HFD to induce anhedonia-like behavior and reduce self-care in mice. Methods: Male mice were fed a control diet or HFD (60 kJ% from fat) for a period of 4 weeks, after which behavioral tests and molecular analyses (gut microbiome composition, intestinal metabolome, fecal fatty acids, plasma hormone levels) were performed. The role of the intestinal microbiota was addressed by selective depletion of gut bacteria with a combination of non-absorbable antibiotics, while the implication of leptin was examined by the use of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Results: Antibiotic treatment reduced the HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity and prevented HFD-induced anhedonia-like behavior and self-care reduction. These effects were associated with a decrease in fecal fatty acids and intestinal microbiota-related metabolites including short-chain fatty acids, glucose and amino acids. Gut microbiota depletion suppressed the HFD-induced rise of plasma leptin, and the circulating leptin levels correlated with the anhedonia-like behavior and reduced self-care caused by HFD. The anhedonic effect of HFD was absent in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice although these animals gained more weight and adiposity in response to HFD than wild-type mice. Discussion: The results indicate that anhedonia-like behavior induced by HFD in mice depends on the intestinal microbiome and involves leptin as a signaling hormone. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Histologic Lesions Induced by Murine Norovirus Infection in Laboratory Mice,"Hsu CC, Piotrowski SL, Meeker SM, Smith KD, Maggio-Price L, Treuting PM",2016,Article,10.1177/0300985815618439,"Murine noroviruses (MNVs) are highly prevalent in laboratory mice, can cause persistent infections, and have been shown to infect macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. To address the potential impact of MNV infection on research outcomes, numerous studies have been conducted with various mouse models of human disease and have generated mixed results, ranging from no impact to significant disease. Many of these studies included histologic evaluations after MNV infection, and these results have similarly been variable in terms of whether MNV induces lesions, despite the fact that localization of MNV by viral culture and molecular techniques have demonstrated systemic distribution regardless of mouse immune status. The aim of this review is to summarize the histologic findings that have been reported with MNV infection in several mouse models. The studies demonstrate that experimental infection of MNV in wild-type mice results in minimal to no histologic changes. In contrast, immunodeficient mice consistently have detectable MNV-induced lesions that are typically inflammatory and, in the most severe cases, accompanied by necrosis. In these, the liver is commonly affected, with more variable lesions reported in the lung, gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, brain, and spleen. In specific disease models including atherosclerosis, MNV infection had a variable impact that was dependent on the mouse model, viral strain, timing of infection, or other experimental variables. It is important to recognize the reported MNV lesions to help discern the possible influence of MNV infection on data generated in mouse models. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","atherosclerosis; caliciviridae; calicivirus; histopathology; ifnαβγr-/-; laboratory animals; laboratory mice; murine norovirus; pathology; stat1-/-; animal; brain; calicivirus infection; disease model; experimental animal; gastrointestinal tract; inflammation; liver; mouse; necrosis; norovirus; pathology; physiology; spleen; virology; animals; animals, laboratory; brain; caliciviridae infections; disease models, animal; gastrointestinal tract; inflammation; liver; mice; necrosis; norovirus; spleen",No
Learning to starve: impacts of food limitation beyond the stress period,"McCue MD, Terblanche JS, Benoit JB",2017,Article,10.1242/jeb.157867,"Starvation is common among wild animal populations, and many individuals experience repeated bouts of starvation over the course of their lives. Although much information has been gained through laboratory studies of acute starvation, little is known about how starvation affects an animal once food is again available (i.e. during the refeeding and recovery phases). Many animals exhibit a curious phenomenon - some seem to 'get better' at starving following exposure to one or more starvation events - by this we mean that they exhibit potentially adaptive responses, including reduced rates of mass loss, reduced metabolic rates, and lower costs of digestion. During subsequent refeedings they may also exhibit improved digestive efficiency and more rapid mass gain. Importantly, these responses can last until the next starvation bout or even be inherited and expressed in the subsequent generation. Currently, however, little is known about the molecular regulation and physiological mechanisms underlying these changes. Here, we identify areas of research that can fill in the most pressing knowledge gaps. In particular, we highlight how recently refined techniques (e.g. stable isotope tracers, quantitative magnetic resonance and thermal measurement) as well as next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g. RNA-seq, proteomics and holobiome sequencing) can address specific starvation-focused questions. We also describe outstanding unknowns ripe for future research regarding the timing and severity of starvation, and concerning the persistence of these responses and their interactions with other ecological stressors.",bioenergetics; diet; epigenetics; fasting; nutrition; weight loss; quantitative magnetic-resonance; metabolic-rate depression; body-composition; starvation resistance; gut microbiota; physiological-responses; oxygen-consumption; prenatal exposure; gene-expression; dynamic action,No
"Global population genetic structure and demographic trajectories of the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens","Kaya C, Generalovic TN, Ståhls G, Hauser M, Samayoa AC, Nunes-Silva CG, Roxburgh H, Wohlfahrt J, Ewusie EA, Kenis M, Hanboonsong Y, Orozco J, Carrejo N, Nakamura S, Gasco L, Rojo S, Tanga CM, Meier R, Rhode C, Picard CJ, Jiggins CD, Leiber F, Tomberlin JK, Hasselmann M, Blanckenhorn WU, Kapun M, Sandrock C",2021,Article,10.1186/s12915-021-01029-w,"Background: The black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) is the most promising insect candidate for nutrient-recycling through bioconversion of organic waste into biomass, thereby improving sustainability of protein supplies for animal feed and facilitating transition to a circular economy. Contrary to conventional livestock, genetic resources of farmed insects remain poorly characterised. We present the first comprehensive population genetic characterisation of H. illucens. Based on 15 novel microsatellite markers, we genotyped and analysed 2862 individuals from 150 wild and captive populations originating from 57 countries on seven subcontinents. Results: We identified 16 well-distinguished genetic clusters indicating substantial global population structure. The data revealed genetic hotspots in central South America and successive northwards range expansions within the indigenous ranges of the Americas. Colonisations and naturalisations of largely unique genetic profiles occurred on all non-native continents, either preceded by demographically independent founder events from various single sources or involving admixture scenarios. A decisive primarily admixed Polynesian bridgehead population serially colonised the entire Australasian region and its secondarily admixed descendants successively mediated invasions into Africa and Europe. Conversely, captive populations from several continents traced back to a single North American origin and exhibit considerably reduced genetic diversity, although some farmed strains carry distinct genetic signatures. We highlight genetic footprints characteristic of progressing domestication due to increasing socio-economic importance of H. illucens, and ongoing introgression between domesticated strains globally traded for large-scale farming and wild populations in some regions. Conclusions: We document the dynamic population genetic history of a cosmopolitan dipteran of South American origin shaped by striking geographic patterns. These reflect both ancient dispersal routes, and stochastic and heterogeneous anthropogenic introductions during the last century leading to pronounced diversification of worldwide structure of H. illucens. Upon the recent advent of its agronomic commercialisation, however, current human-mediated translocations of the black soldier fly largely involve genetically highly uniform domesticated strains, which meanwhile threaten the genetic integrity of differentiated unique local resources through introgression. Our in-depth reconstruction of the contemporary and historical demographic trajectories of H. illucens emphasises benchmarking potential for applied future research on this emerging model of the prospering insect-livestock sector. © 2021, The Author(s).",allelic richness; approximate bayesian computation; diptera; founder effect; genetic differentiation; genetic drift; invasive species; isolation by distance; serial introductions; stratiomyidae; adult; africa; agricultural worker; article; benchmarking; demography; diptera; domestication; europe; female; founder effect; gene rearrangement; genetic drift; genetic isolation by distance; genetic profile; genetic variability; human; human experiment; introgression; invasive species; livestock; major clinical study; male; microsatellite marker; military personnel; nonhuman; population genetic structure; progeny; south america; stochastic model,No
Severity of doxorubicin-induced small intestinal mucositis is regulated by the TLR-2 and TLR-9 pathways,"Kaczmarek A, Brinkman BM, Heyndrickx L, Vandenabeele P, Krysko DV",2012,Article,10.1002/path.3009,"Intestinal mucositis is a serious complication of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy; it frequently compromises treatment and dramatically reduces the quality of life of patients. Different approaches to limit the damage to the intestine during anti-cancer therapy have been largely ineffective due to insufficient knowledge of the mechanism of mucositis development. This study aimed to define the role of TLR-2 and TLR-9 in the modulation of small intestinal damage in a model of doxorubicin-induced mucositis. Doxorubicin-induced intestinal damage was verified by a histological score (HS), analysis of leukocyte influx into the lamina propria, and determination of the number of apoptotic cells. Additionally, the activation status of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) was assessed. Wild-type (WT) mice injected with doxorubicin demonstrated severe intestinal damage (HS 8.0 ± 0.81), reduction of villus length to 43.9% ± 13.7% of original length, and increased influx of leukocytes as compared to vehicle-injected mice (HS 1.33 ± 1.15). The protective effect of TLR-2 or TLR-9 deficiency was associated with a significant decrease of the HS as compared to WT mice. In the ileum, a minor reduction of villus length and a decreased number of infiltrating leukocytes and TUNEL-positive cells was observed. We demonstrate that the TLR-9 antagonist ODN2088 reduces doxorubicin-induced intestinal damage. Furthermore, we show that GSK-3β activity is inhibited in the absence of TLR-2. The protective capacity of GSK-3β suppression was observed in WT mice by inhibiting it with the specific inhibitor SB216763. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the TLR-2/GSK-3β and TLR-9 signalling pathways play a central role in the development of intestinal mucositis and we suggest a new therapeutic strategy for limiting doxorubicin-induced intestinal inflammation. © 2011 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Since it was newly revealed that Kupffer cells in the liver express RELMβ and that RELMβ expression levels in the colon and the numbers of RELMβ-positive Kupffer cells were both increased in this model, we carried out further experiments using radiation chimeras between wild-type and RELMβ-KO mice to distinguish between the contributions of RELMβ in these two organs. These experiments revealed the requirement of RELMβ in both organs for full manifestation of NASH, while deletion of each one alone attenuated the development of NASH with reduced serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. The higher proportion of lactic acid bacteria in the gut microbiota of RELMβ-KO than in that of wild-type mice may be one of the mechanisms underlying the lower serum LPS level the former. These data suggest the contribution of increases in RELMβ in the gut and Kupffer cells to NASH development, raising the possibility of RELMβ being a novel therapeutic target for NASH. © 2016, Nature Publishing Group.

Caspase deficiency alters the murine gut microbiome,"Brinkman BM, Hildebrand F, Kubica M, Goosens D, Del Favero J, Declercq W, Raes J, Vandenabeele P",2011,Article,10.1038/cddis.2011.101,"Caspases are aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that have an essential role in apoptosis and inflammation, and contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in the intestine. These facts, together with the knowledge that caspases are implicated in hostmicrobe crosstalk, prompted us to investigate the effect of caspase (Casp)1, -3 and -7 deficiency on the composition of the murine gut microbiota. We observed significant changes in the abundance of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla, in particular the Lachnospiraceae, Porphyromonodaceae and Prevotellacea families, when comparing Casp-1, -7 and -3 knockout mice with wild-type mice.

Geographic pattern of antibiotic resistance genes in the metagenomes of the giant panda,"Hu T, Dai Q, Chen H, Zhang Z, Dai Q, Gu X, Yang X, Yang Z, Zhu L",2021,Article,10.1111/1751-7915.13655,"The rise in infections by antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a serious public health problem worldwide. The gut microbiome of animals is a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the correlation between the gut microbiome of wild animals and ARGs remains controversial. Here, based on the metagenomes of giant pandas (including three wild populations from the Qinling, Qionglai and Xiaoxiangling Mountains, and two major captive populations from Yaan and Chengdu), we investigated the potential correlation between the constitution of the gut microbiome and the composition of ARGs across the different geographic locations and living environments. We found that the types of ARGs were correlated with gut microbiome composition. The NMDS cluster analysis using Jaccard distance of the ARGs composition of the gut microbiome of wild giant pandas displayed a difference based on geographic location. Captivity also had an effect on the differences in ARGs composition. Furthermore, we found that the Qinling population exhibited profound dissimilarities of both gut microbiome composition and ARGs (the highest proportion of Clostridium and vancomycin resistance genes) when compared to the other wild and captive populations studies, which was supported by previous giant panda whole-genome sequencing analysis. In this study, we provide an example of a potential consensus pattern regarding host population genetics, symbiotic gut microbiome and ARGs. We revealed that habitat isolation impacts the ARG structure in the gut microbiome of mammals. Therefore, the difference in ARG composition between giant panda populations will provide some basic information for their conservation and management, especially for captive populations. © 2020 The Authors.

Influence of lab adapted natural diet and microbiota on life history and metabolic phenotype of drosophila melanogaster,"Bombin A, Cunneely O, Eickman K, Bombin S, Ruesy A, Su M, Myers A, Cowan R, Reed L",2020,Article,10.3390/microorganisms8121972,"Symbiotic microbiota can help its host to overcome nutritional challenges, which is consistent with a holobiont theory of evolution. Our project investigated the effects produced by the microbiota community, acquired from the environment and horizontal transfer, on metabolic traits related to obesity. The study applied a novel approach of raising Drosophila melanogaster, from ten wild-derived genetic lines on naturally fermented peaches, preserving genuine microbial conditions. Larvae raised on the natural and standard lab diets were significantly different in every tested phenotype. Frozen peach food provided nutritional conditions similar to the natural ones and preserved key microbial taxa necessary for survival and development. On the peach diet, the presence of parental microbiota increased the weight and development rate. Larvae raised on each tested diet formed microbial communities distinct from each other.

Characteristics of microbial communities and intestinal pathogenic bacteria for migrated Larus ridibundus in southwest China,"Liao F, Gu W, Li D, Liang J, Fu X, Xu W, Duan R, Wang X, Jing H, Dai J",2019,Article,10.1002/mbo3.693,"Larus ridibundus, a migratory wild bird, has become one of the most popular gull species in southwest China in recent years. There has been no information on the gut microbiota and intestinal pathogenic bacteria configuration in wild L. ridibundus, even though the public are in close contact with this bird. In this study, 16S rRNA amplicon-sequencing methods were used to describe the microbial community structure and intestinal pathogenic bacteria were isolated to identify their characteristics. The taxonomic results revealed that Firmicutes (86%), Proteobacteria (10%), and Tenericutes (3%) were the three most abundant phyla in the gut of L. ridibundus. Enterococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Mycoplasmataceae were the most predominant families, respectively. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), the richness estimates and diversity indices of microbiota, was statistically different (p < 0.05). However, beta diversity showed that no statistical significance (p > 0.05) between all the fecal samples. The most frequently isolated intestinal pathogenic bacteria from L. ridibundus were enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (32%) and Salmonella (21%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results of Salmonella species revealed a high degree of similarity between isolates, which was not observed for other species. None of the potentially pathogenic isolates were identical to human-isolated counterparts suggesting that there was little cross-infection between humans and gulls, despite close proximity. In brief, this study provided a baseline for future L. ridibundus microbiology analysis, and made an understanding of the intestinal bacterial community structure and diversity. © 2018 The Authors.

Microbial Metabolic Capacity for Intestinal Folate Production and Modulation of Host Folate Receptors,"Engevik MA, Morra CN, Röth D, Engevik K, Spinler JK, Devaraj S, Crawford SE, Estes MK, Kalkum M, Versalovic J",2019,Article,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02305,"Microbial metabolites, including B complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects of human health. Folate, or vitamin B9, refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut microbiota has been recognized as a source of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human Microbiome Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete de novo folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal Lactobacillus reuteri to examine host–microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type L. reuteri did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from L. reuteri containing a site-specific inactivation of the folC gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using L. reuteri with a site inactivation of folC2, which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host metabolism. © Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.",b vitamin; enteroids; folate transporters; folylpolyglutamate; lactobacilli; lactobacillus reuteri; microbiome; bacterial rna; folate receptor; genomic dna; proton coupled folate transporter; pteroptin; reduced folate carrier; vitamin b complex; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; biosynthesis; cohort analysis; colon tissue; colony forming unit; comparative study; controlled study; dna synthesis; epigenetics; evaluation study; gene expression; genome analysis; growth curve; host microbe interaction; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; immunomodulation; intestine flora; lactobacillus reuteri; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; metabolic capacity; nonhuman; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; rna extraction; rna sequence; upregulation,No
Phylogenetic analysis of faecal microbiota from captive cheetahs reveals underrepresentation of Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteriaceae,"Becker AA, Hesta M, Hollants J, Janssens GP, Huys G",2014,Article,10.1186/1471-2180-14-43,"Background: Imbalanced feeding regimes may initiate gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases in endangered felids kept in captivity such as cheetahs. Given the crucial role of the host's intestinal microbiota in feed fermentation and health maintenance, a better understanding of the cheetah's intestinal ecosystem is essential for improvement of current feeding strategies. We determined the phylogenetic diversity of the faecal microbiota of the only two cheetahs housed in an EAZA associated zoo in Flanders, Belgium, to gain first insights in the relative distribution, identity and potential role of the major community members. Results: Taxonomic analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries (702 clones) revealed a microbiota dominated by Firmicutes (94.7%), followed by a minority of Actinobacteria (4.3%), Proteobacteria (0.4%) and Fusobacteria (0.6%). In the Firmicutes, the majority of the phylotypes within the Clostridiales were assigned to Clostridium clusters XIVa (43%), XI (38%) and I (13%). Members of the Bacteroidetes phylum and Bifidobacteriaceae, two groups that can positively contribute in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, were absent in the clone libraries and detected in only marginal to low levels in real-time PCR analyses. Conclusions: This marked underrepresentation is in contrast to data previously reported in domestic cats where Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteriaceae are common residents of the faecal microbiota. Next to methodological differences, these findings may also reflect the apparent differences in dietary habits of both felid species. Thus, our results question the role of the domestic cat as the best available model for nutritional intervention studies in endangered exotic felids. © 2014 Becker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","bacterial community sequencing; exotic felids; wildlife conservation; zoo nutrition; retinol; actinobacteria; adult; article; bacteroides fragilis; bacteroides uniformis; bacteroidetes; bifidobacteriaceae; cheetah; clostridiaceae; clostridiales; clostridium; dna extraction; dna template; erysipelotrichaceae; feces microflora; firmicutes; fusobacteria; gene library; lactobacillaceae; male; microbial community; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; acinonyx jubatus; actinobacteria; bacteria (microorganisms); bacteroidetes; bacteroidetes phylum; bifidobacteriaceae; clostridiales; clostridium; felidae; felis catus; firmicutes; fusobacteria; proteobacteria; acinonyx; actinobacteria; animals; animals, zoo; bacteroidetes; belgium; biota; cluster analysis; dna, bacterial; dna, ribosomal; gastrointestinal tract; male; molecular sequence data; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal, 16s; sequence analysis, dna",No

Both colitic and noncolitic T5KO exhibited transiently unstable microbiotas, with lasting differences in colitic T5KO, while their noncolitic siblings stabilized their microbiotas to resemble wild-type mice. Transient high levels of proteobacteria, especially enterobacteria species including E. coli, observed in close proximity to the gut epithelium were a striking feature of colitic microbiota. A Crohn's disease-associated E. coli strain induced chronic colitis in T5KO, which persisted well after the exogenously introduced bacterial species had been eliminated.

Transcriptional profiling of the mutualistic bacterium Vibrio fischeri and an hfq mutant under modeled microgravity,"Duscher AA, Conesa A, Bishop M, Vroom MM, Zubizarreta SD, Foster JS",2018,Article,10.1038/s41526-018-0060-1,"For long-duration space missions, it is critical to maintain health-associated homeostasis between astronauts and their microbiome. To achieve this goal it is important to more fully understand the host–symbiont relationship under the physiological stress conditions of spaceflight. To address this issue we examined the impact of a spaceflight analog, low-shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG), on the transcriptome of the mutualistic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Cultures of V. fischeri and a mutant defective in the global regulator Hfq (∆hfq) were exposed to either LSMMG or gravity conditions for 12 h (exponential growth) and 24 h (stationary phase growth). Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed few to no significant differentially expressed genes between gravity and the LSMMG conditions in the wild type or mutant V. fischeri at exponential or stationary phase. There was, however, a pronounced change in transcriptomic profiles during the transition between exponential and stationary phase growth in both V. fischeri cultures including an overall decrease in gene expression associated with translational activity and an increase in stress response. There were also several upregulated stress genes specific to the LSMMG condition during the transition to stationary phase growth. The ∆hfq mutants exhibited a distinctive transcriptome profile with a significant increase in transcripts associated with flagellar synthesis and transcriptional regulators under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls. These results indicate the loss of Hfq significantly influences gene expression under LSMMG conditions in a bacterial symbiont. Together, these results improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which microgravity alters the physiology of beneficial host-associated microbes. © 2018, The Author(s).",; bacteria; manned space flight; microgravity processing; physiology; transcription; bacterial symbionts; differentially expressed gene; gravity conditions; long duration space mission; physiological stress; transcriptional profiling; transcriptional regulator; transcriptome profiles; microgravity,No
Functional role of ADAMTS5 in adiposity and metabolic health,"Bauters D, Bedossa P, Lijnen HR, Hemmeryckx B",2018,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0190595,"Previous studies with gene-deficient mice (ADAMTS5-P) revealed that ADAMTS5 (A Disin-tegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 5) plays a functional role in adiposity and metabolic health. To confirm these observations, we have performed similar studies with an independently generated strain of ADAMTS5 deficient mice (ADAMTS5-J). Upon cold exposure as well as after high-fat diet feeding (diet-induced obesity or DIO model), these knockout (KO) mice developed less subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) as compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (reduction was more pronounced in ADAMTS5-P mice). Enhanced browning of WAT, as monitored by expression of UCP-1 was seen in the ADAMTS5-J KO mice upon cold exposure but not in the DIO model (seen in both conditions with the ADAMTS5-P mice). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass was not different between KO and WT ADAMTS5-J mice, either upon cold exposure or in the DIO model (in contrast to the enhanced BAT mass with the ADAMTS5-P mice). Energy expenditure and thermogenesis were not significantly different between KO and WT ADAMTS5-J mice (in contrast to somewhat enhanced levels in ADAMTS5-P mice). Insulin sensitivity was improved in the ADAMTS5-J KO mice, and they were protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the DIO model (as the ADAMTS5-P mice). These data are thus similar for both strains of KO mice, confirming specificity of the phenotype, but some quantitative and qualitative differences are also observed. © 2018 Bauters et al.

Acetate metabolic requirement of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli promotes its intracellular proliferation within macrophage,"Zhuge X, Sun Y, Jiang M, Wang J, Tang F, Xue F, Ren J, Zhu W, Dai J",2019,Article,10.1186/s13567-019-0650-2,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is a facultative intracellular pathogen, and intracellular persistence in macrophages is essential for APEC extraintestinal dissemination. Until now, there is still no systematic interpretation of APEC intracellular proliferation. Intracellular survival factors, especially involved in pathometabolism, need to be further revealed. Acetate plays critical roles in supporting energy homeostasis and acts as a metabolic signal in the inflammatory response of eukaryotes. In this study, we identified that APEC acs-yjcH-actP operon, encoding acetate assimilation system, presented the host-induced transcription during its proliferation in macrophages. Our result showed that this acetate assimilation system acted as a novel intracellular survival factor to promote APEC replication within macrophages. Furthermore, deletion of acs-yjcH-actP operon in APEC decreased its cytotoxic level to macrophages. qRT-PCR results showed that the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12β, and TNF-α) and iNOS in FY26 acs-yjcH-actP infected macrophages were obviously down-regulated compared to that in wild-type FY26 infected cells. Deletion of actP/yjcH/acs genes attenuated APEC virulence and colonization capability in avian lungs in vivo for colibacillosis infection models. And acetate assimilation system acted as a virulence factor and conferred a fitness advantage during APEC early colonization. Taken together, our research unravelled the metabolic requirement of APEC intracellular survival/replication within macrophages, and acetate metabolic requirement acted as an important strategy of APEC pathometabolism. The intracellular acetate consumption during facultative intracellular bacteria replication within macrophages promoted immunomodulatory disorders, resulting in excessively pro-inflammatory responses of host macrophages. © 2019 The Author(s).","; acetic acid; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; nitric oxide; tumor necrosis factor; virulence factor; acetic acid; cytokine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; avian colibacillosis; bird; carbon fixation; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytotoxicity assay; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; escherichia coli; eukaryote; gene deletion; gene overexpression; growth curve; histology; homeostasis; imaging; immunofluorescent imaging; inflammation; lscc-hd11 cell line; macrophage; nonhuman; operon; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rna isolation; survival factor; animal; bird disease; cell line; chicken; duck; escherichia coli; escherichia coli infection; growth, development and aging; macrophage; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; real time polymerase chain reaction; veterinary medicine; acetates; animals; bird diseases; cell line; chickens; cytokines; ducks; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; escherichia coli; escherichia coli infections; macrophages; poultry diseases; real-time polymerase chain reaction",No
Fecal microbial transplant after ileocolic resection reduces ileitis but restores colitis in IL-10 -/- Mice,"Perry T, Jovel J, Patterson J, Wong G, Fedorak RN, Thiesen A, Dicken B, Madsen KL",2015,Article,10.1097/MIB.0000000000000383,"Background: Ileocolic resection (ICR) is frequently performed for Crohn's disease; however, disease commonly recurs early in the neoterminal ileum. The aim of this study was to use the IL-10 -/- mouse to determine the effects of ICR on gut microbiome and immune function and if postoperative fecal microbial transplant (FMT) would improve disease. Methods: ICR was performed in 129S1/SvlmJ IL10 -/- mice followed by FMT using stool from wild-type mice. Sham-transplant mice received their own stool. Stool samples were collected on day 0, day 13 (after ICR), and day 27 (after FMT) for whole metagenome shot-gun sequencing. Mucosal-associated bacteria were quantified with quantitative PCR and visualized by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Tissue cytokines were measured with multiplex arrays and mononuclear phagocyte populations by flow cytometry. Results: Surgery induced microbial functional and taxonomic shifts, decreased diversity, and depleted Bacteroidia and Clostridia. ICR mice had reduced colitis but worse ileitis with bacterial overgrowth, increased translocation, and reduction in tissue macrophages. FMT prevented ileitis but restored colitis and allowed for a bloom of γ-proteobacteria. In the colon, ICR and sham transplant were associated with recruitment of tolerogenic dendritic cells, whereas FMT shifted these immune cell subsets to control profiles along with increasing cytokine levels. Conclusions: This study suggests that surgical-induced immune dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis with impaired clearance may be the underlying cause of the early ulcerations found in the ileum of patients with Crohn's disease after ICR. FMT has an immunostimulatory effect on the postoperative intestine, which was beneficial in preventing ileitis, but detrimental in restoring colonic injury after surgery. © 2015 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.","colitis; crohn's disease; dendritic cells; dysbiosis; metagenome; cd103 antigen; cd11b antigen; cxcl1 chemokine; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; interleukin 10; rna; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial load; bacterial overgrowth; cell subpopulation; clostridia; colitis; controlled study; dendritic cell; dysbiosis; enterococcus; epithelium hyperplasia; fecal microbial transplant; feces analysis; flow cytometry; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gammaproteobacteria; histology; ileitis; ileocolic resection; immunocompetent cell; intestine flora; lactobacillus; metagenome; microbial diversity; microbiological phenomena and functions; mononuclear phagocyte; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; postoperative care; priority journal; quantitative analysis; small intestine resection; streptococcus; wild type; anastomosis; animal; bacterial translocation; colitis; colon; colon resection; deficiency; disease model; feces; genetics; ileitis; ileum; male; microbiology; procedures; surgery; anastomosis, surgical; animals; bacterial translocation; colectomy; colitis; colon; disease models, animal; dysbiosis; feces; ileitis; ileum; in situ hybridization, fluorescence; interleukin-10; male; mice; rna",No

Reduced mucus thickness and impaired O-glycosylation are observed in human ulcerative colitis. However, how both types of O-glycans maintain mucus barrier function in the colon is unclear. We found that C1galt1 expression, which synthesizes core 1 O-glycans, was detected throughout the colon, whereas C3GnT, which controls core 3 O-glycan formation, was most highly expressed in the proximal colon. Consistent with this, mice lacking intestinal core 1-derived O-glycans (IEC C1galt1 -/-) developed spontaneous colitis primarily in the distal colon, whereas mice lacking both intestinal core 1- and 3-derived O-glycans (DKO) developed spontaneous colitis in both the distal and proximal colon. DKO mice showed an early onset and more severe colitis than IEC C1galt1 -/- mice. Antibiotic treatment restored the mucus layer and attenuated colitis in DKO mice. Mucins from DKO mice were more susceptible to proteolysis than wild-type mucins.

"Taxonomy, not locality, influences the cloacal microbiota of two nearctic colubrids: a preliminary analysis","Dallas JW, Meshaka WE, Jr, Zeglin L, Warne RW",2021,Article,10.1007/s11033-021-06645-x,"Background: The gut microbiota is an emerging frontier in wildlife research and its importance to vertebrate health and physiology is becoming ever more apparent. Reptiles, in particular snakes, have not received the same attention given to other vertebrates and the composition of their wild gut microbiome remains understudied. The primary goal of this work was to describe the cloacal microbiota of two Colubrids, the Eastern Gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis) and the Northern Watersnake (Nerodia sipedon sipedon), and if their cloacal microbiota differed as well as if it did between a wetland and upland population of the former species. Methods and results: We utilized next-generation sequencing of cloacal swabs—a non-destructive proxy for the gut microbiota. The cloacal microbiome of Eastern Gartersnakes (N = 9) was like those of other snakes being comprised of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, while that of Northern Watersnakes (N = 6) was dominated by Tenericutes. Seven microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), all members of Proteobacteria, were shared among all individuals and were indicative of a core microbiome in Eastern Gartersnakes, but these OTUs were not particularly relevant to Northern Watersnakes. The latter had greater OTU richness than did Eastern Gartersnakes, and habitat did not have any apparent effect on the microbial community composition in Eastern Gartersnakes.

Clcn3 deficiency ameliorates high-fat diet-induced obesity and adipose tissue macrophage inflammation in mice,"Ma M-M, Jin C-C, Huang X-L, Sun L, Zhou H, Wen X-J, Huang X-Q, Du J-Y, Sun H-S, Ren Z-X, Liu J, Guan Y-Y, Zhao X-M, Wang G-L",2019,Article,10.1038/s41401-019-0229-5,"Obesity induces accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and ATM-driven inflammatory responses that promote the development of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. ClC-3 chloride channel/antiporter, encoded by the Clcn3, is critical for some basic cellular functions. Our previous work has shown significant alleviation of type 2 diabetes in Clcn3 knockout (Clcn3−/−) mice. In the present study we investigated the role of Clcn3 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and ATM inflammation. To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3−/− mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. The metabolic parameters were assessed and the abdominal total adipose tissue was scanned using computed tomography. Their epididymal fat pad tissue and adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were isolated for analyses. We found that the HFD-fed Clcn3−/− mice displayed a significant decrease in obesity-induced body weight gain and abdominal visceral fat accumulation as well as an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism as compared with HFD-fed wild-type mice. Furthermore, the Clcn3 deficiency significantly attenuated HFD-induced ATM accumulation, HFD-increased F4/80+ CD11c+ CD206− SVF cells as well as HFD-activated TLR-4/NF-κB signaling in epididymal fat tissue. In cultured human THP-1 macrophages, adenovirus-mediated transfer of Clcn3 specific shRNA inhibited, whereas adenovirus-mediated cDNA overexpression of Clcn3 enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB and TLR-4. These results demonstrate a novel role for Clcn3 in HFD-induced obesity and ATM inflammation. © 2019, CPS and SIMM.","adipose tissue; clcn3; inflammation; insulin resistance; macrophage; obesity; adipose tissue; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; body weight; clcn3 gene; computer assisted tomography; diet-induced obesity; epididymis fat; gene; glucose metabolism; human; human cell; inflammation; intra-abdominal fat; lipid metabolism; macrophage; nonhuman; wild type; animal; cell line; genetics; inflammation; knockout mouse; lipid diet; macrophage; metabolism; obesity; pathology; white adipose tissue; chloride channel; clc-3 channel; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; tlr4 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 4; adipose tissue, white; animals; cell line; chloride channels; diet, high-fat; humans; inflammation; macrophages; mice, knockout; nf-kappa b; obesity; toll-like receptor 4",No
Skin bacterial microflora of two closely related mountain newts (Salamandridae) – the Yellow-spotted mountain newt Neurergus derjugini and the Kaiser's mountain newt Neurergus kaiseri – in the wild and in a breeding facility highlight new conservation perspectives,"Vaissi S, Sharifi M, Hernandez A, Nikpey S, Taran M",2019,Article,10.1111/izy.12230,"Microbiome research is important for the identification of factors that are associated with the ex situ care of amphibians, such as potential contagious and lethal pathogens. Nevertheless, it can be also used to establish whether newts can adapt to exposure to new microbial communities, which would be important for the success of future reintroductions into the natural habitat. There is no available information regarding the skin flora naturally occurring in mountain newts of the genus Neurergus, including the Yellow-spotted mountain newt Neurergus derjugini and the Kaiser's mountain newt Neurergus kaiseri. In this study, skin bacterial microbiota of wild adults and individuals of both species from a captive-breeding facility (CBF) were compared. Four bacteria that naturally occur on the skin of wild adult N. derjugini were identified (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli). Six bacteria were positively detected on the skin of wild adult N. kaiseri [S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. cereus, E. coli, Rhodococcus equi, Klebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes]. Our results indicate that the skin microbiota of F1 offspring (≤ 2 months of age) from the CBF did not correspond exactly to the microbial community identified in wild adult N. derjugini. However, ≥ 75% of the bacteria found in older individuals (≥ 1 year of age) living at the CBF over the long term corresponded to those of their wild counterparts. It would appear that post-metamorphic and adults of both species might be better able to resist and adapt to natural microbiota than larvae. © 2019 The Zoological Society of London",amphibians; captive management; microbiome; mountain newt; reintroduction; skin flora; ,No
Role of the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) in the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity,"Sabui S, Bohl JA, Kapadia R, Cogburn K, Ghosal A, Lambrecht NW, Said HM",2016,Article,10.1152/ajpgi.00240.2016,"Utilizing a conditional (intestinal-specific) knockout (cKO) mouse model, we have recently shown that the sodium-dependent multivita-min transporter (SMVT) (SLC5A6) is the only biotin uptake system that operates in the gut and that its deletion leads to biotin deficiency. Unexpectedly, we also observed that all SMVT-cKO mice develop chronic active inflammation, especially in the cecum. Our aim here was to examine the role of SMVT in the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity [permeability and expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins]. Our results showed that knocking out the mouse intestinal SMVT is associated with a significant increase in gut permeability and with changes in the level of expression of TJ proteins. To determine whether these changes are related to the state of biotin deficiency that develops in SMVT-cKO mice, we induced (by dietary means) biotin deficiency in wild-type mice and examined its effect on the above-mentioned parameters. The results showed that dietary-induced biotin deficiency leads to a similar development of chronic active inflammation in the cecum with an increase in the level of expression of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as an increase in intestinal permeability and changes in the level of expression of TJ proteins. We also examined the effect of chronic biotin deficiency on permeability and expression of TJ proteins in confluent intestinal epithelial Caco-2 monolayers but observed no changes in these parameters. These results show that the intestinal SMVT plays an important role in the maintenance of normal mucosal integrity, most likely via its role in providing biotin to different cells of the gut mucosa. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.","biotin; mucosal inflammation; mucosal integrity; sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter knockout; tight junction proteins; biotin; claudin 1; claudin 2; gamma interferon; myosin light chain kinase; protein; protein zo1; sodium dependent multivitamin transporter; tight junction protein; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; biotin; biotin transporter; cotransporter; tight junction protein; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cecum; controlled study; enteritis; gene inactivation; human; human cell; immunocompetent cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; intestine epithelium cell; intestine mucosa; intestine mucosa permeability; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; vitamin deficiency; animal; biotinidase deficiency; caco-2 cell line; gene expression regulation; genetics; homeostasis; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; metabolism; permeability; physiology; animals; biotin; biotinidase deficiency; caco-2 cells; gene expression regulation; homeostasis; humans; intestinal mucosa; mice; mice, knockout; permeability; symporters; tight junction proteins",No

Host diet and evolutionary history explain different aspects of gut microbiome diversity among vertebrate clades,"Youngblut ND, Reischer GH, Walters W, Schuster N, Walzer C, Stalder G, Ley RE, Farnleitner AH",2019,Article,10.1038/s41467-019-10191-3,"Multiple factors modulate microbial community assembly in the vertebrate gut, though studies disagree as to their relative contribution. One cause may be a reliance on captive animals, which can have very different gut microbiomes compared to their wild counterparts. To resolve this disagreement, we analyze a new, large, and highly diverse animal distal gut 16 S rRNA microbiome dataset, which comprises 80% wild animals and includes members of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and Actinopterygii. We decouple the effects of host evolutionary history and diet on gut microbiome diversity and show that each factor modulates different aspects of diversity. Moreover, we resolve particular microbial taxa associated with host phylogeny or diet and show that Mammalia have a stronger signal of cophylogeny. Finally, we find that environmental filtering and microbe-microbe interactions differ among host clades.

The role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the gut microbiota in zebrafish,"Stagaman K, Burns AR, Guillemin K, Bohannan BJM",2017,Article,10.1038/ismej.2017.28,"All animals live in intimate association with communities of microbes, collectively referred to as their microbiota. Certain host traits can influence which microbial taxa comprise the microbiota. One potentially important trait in vertebrate animals is the adaptive immune system, which has been hypothesized to act as an ecological filter, promoting the presence of some microbial taxa over others. Here we surveyed the intestinal microbiota of 68 wild-type zebrafish, with functional adaptive immunity, and 61 rag1 'zebrafish, lacking functional B- and T-cell receptors, to test the role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the intestinal microbiota. In addition, we tested the robustness of adaptive immunity's filtering effects to host-host interaction by comparing the microbiota of fish populations segregated by genotype to those containing both genotypes. The presence of adaptive immunity individualized the gut microbiota and decreased the contributions of neutral processes to gut microbiota assembly. Although mixing genotypes led to increased phylogenetic diversity in each, there was no significant effect of adaptive immunity on gut microbiota composition in either housing condition. Interestingly, the most robust effect on microbiota composition was co-housing within a tank. In all, these results suggest that adaptive immunity has a role as an ecological filter of the zebrafish gut microbiota, but it can be overwhelmed by other factors, including transmission of microbes among hosts.",; adaptation; cells and cell components; community composition; cyprinid; digestive system; genotype; immune system; immunity; microbial community; phylogenetics; animalia; danio rerio; vertebrata; homeodomain protein; rag-1 protein; adaptive immunity; animal; gene deletion; genetics; genotype; immunology; intestine flora; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; phylogeny; zebra fish; adaptive immunity; animals; gastrointestinal microbiome; gene deletion; genotype; homeodomain proteins; microbiota; phylogeny; zebrafish,No
Intestinal epithelial Toll-like receptor 4 signaling affects epithelial function and colonic microbiota and promotes a risk for transmissible colitis,"Dheer R, Santaolalla R, Davies JM, Lang JK, Phillips MC, Pastorini C, Vazquez-Pertejo MT, Abreu MT",2016,Article,10.1128/IAI.01374-15,"Evidence obtained from gene knockout studies supports the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in intestinal inflammation and microbiota recognition. Increased epithelial TLR4 expression is observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, little is known of the effect of increased TLR4 signaling on intestinal homeostasis. Here, we examined the effect of increased TLR4 signaling on epithelial function and microbiota by using transgenic villin-TLR4 mice that overexpress TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium. Our results revealed that villin-TLR4 mice are characterized by increases in the density of mucosa-associated bacteria and bacterial translocation. Furthermore, increased epithelial TLR4 signaling was associated with an impaired epithelial barrier, altered expression of antimicrobial peptide genes, and altered epithelial cell differentiation. The composition of the colonic luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota differed between villin-TLR4 and wild-type (WT) littermates. Interestingly, WT mice cohoused with villin-TLR4 mice displayed greater susceptibility to acute colitis than singly housed WT mice did. The results of this study suggest that epithelial TLR4 expression shapes the microbiota and affects the functional properties of the epithelium. The changes in the microbiota induced by increased epithelial TLR4 signaling are transmissible and exacerbate dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Together, our findings imply that host innate immune signaling can modulate intestinal bacteria and ultimately the host's susceptibility to colitis. © 2016 Dheer et al..","; cadherin; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; junctional adhesion molecule a; polypeptide antibiotic agent; rna 16s; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor alpha; villin; tlr4 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 4; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial load; bacterial translocation; bacteroides; cell differentiation; clostridium; colitis; colon flora; controlled study; cytokine production; dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis; disease predisposition; epithelium cell; gene expression; innate immunity; intestine epithelium; lactobacillus; mouse; nonhuman; prevotella; priority journal; protein expression; risk factor; ruminococcus; signal transduction; wild type; animal; bacterial translocation; c57bl mouse; colitis; colon; genetics; human; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; metabolism; microbiology; pathophysiology; transgenic mouse; animals; bacterial translocation; colitis; colon; gastrointestinal microbiome; humans; intestinal mucosa; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, transgenic; signal transduction; toll-like receptor 4",No
Immunomodulatory properties of Lactobacillus plantarum and its use as a recombinant vaccine against mite allergy,"Rigaux P, Daniel C, Hisbergues M, Muraille E, Hols P, Pot B, Pestel J, Jacquet A",2009,Article,10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01825.x,"Background: Selected lactic acid bacteria were reported to prevent atopic dermatitis and experimental asthma but the mechanisms of their immunomodulatory effects are not fully elucidated. In this study, the signaling pathways triggered by Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 were investigated and the potential use of this strain producing a variant of the mite allergen Der p 1 as live vaccine vehicle was evaluated. Methods: Mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were stimulated with wild-type or a L. plantarum teichoic acid mutant to evaluate the secretion of cytokines. A recombinant L. plantarum expressing Der p 1 was engineered, its in vitro immunomodulatory properties were characterized and its prophylactic potential was evaluated in a Der p 1-sensitization murine model. Results: Mouse dendritic cells stimulated by L. plantarum triggered the release of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). IL-12 p40 secretion was dependent on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR9 and on the bacterial teichoic acid composition. Recombinant L. plantarum producing Der p 1 exhibited similar immunostimulatory properties as wild-type. Prophylactic intranasal pretreatment of mice with this recombinant strain prevented the development of the typical Th2-biased allergic response by a drastic reduction of specific IgE and the induction of protective allergen-specific IgG2a antibodies. Moreover, both wild-type or recombinant L. plantarum reduced airway eosinophilia following aerosolized allergen exposure and IL-5 secretion upon allergen restimulation. Conclusion: By combining both Th1-type immunostimulatory properties and an efficient allergen delivery capacity, recombinant L. plantarum producing Der p 1 represents a promising vaccine against house dust mite allergy. © 2008 The Authors.","der p 1; recombinant lactobacillus plantarum; toll-like receptor; vaccination; immunoglobulin e; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin g2a antibody; interleukin 10; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 12p70; interleukin 5; live vaccine; mitogen activated protein kinase; recombinant vaccine; teichoic acid; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 9; tumor necrosis factor alpha; allergic reaction; allergy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; cellular immunity; controlled study; cytokine release; dendritic cell; eosinophilia; female; house dust; human; human cell; immunomodulation; immunostimulation; lactobacillus plantarum; mite; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; sensitization; signal transduction; th2 cell; animals; antigens, dermatophagoides; dendritic cells; humans; hypersensitivity; immunoblotting; lactobacillus plantarum; lipopolysaccharides; mice; mice, inbred balb c; mites; signal transduction; teichoic acids; toll-like receptor 2; toll-like receptor 9; transfection; vaccines, synthetic",No
Stress tolerance alteration in the freshwater cnidarian green hydra (Hydra viridissima) via symbiotic algae mutagenesis,"Ye S, Bhattacharjee M, Siemann E",2020,Article,10.1007/s13199-020-00712-w,"Symbiotic organisms such as corals are threatened by changing climate because they are sensitive to stress, and may be unable to adapt quickly due to the long host generation time. Instead of selecting for stress tolerant hosts, manipulating their symbiotic microbes has been proposed because microbes affect holobiont phenotypes and they have rapid life cycles. Because it is time-consuming to isolate stress tolerant symbionts from the wild even when appropriate types exist, mutation and selection of symbionts is a promising alternative approach. Using green hydra (Hydra viridissima) and symbiotic algae (Chlorella variabilis NC64A), we found symbiont mutagenesis in vitro altered their UV-B resistance as well as that of holobionts receiving mutated algae. In addition, hydra UV-B tolerance was positively correlated to that of the algae they were hosting, as the hydra associated with UV-B tolerant algal strains exhibited higher UV-B resistance. However, chronic low-level UV-B selection decreased algal resistance to acute high-level UV-B, which was unexpected, and did not affect UV-B resistance of holobionts. The variations in algal UV-B tolerance and hydra UV-B tolerance were largely due to mutagenesis rather than selection. Our results suggest symbiont mutagenesis and trait-based identification may be more effective than assisted evolution in holobiont phenotype alteration, and it highlights the need to characterize symbiont traits in vitro that are correlated to stress tolerance they can confer to hosts, which may have application in conservation, agriculture and forestry. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",endosymbiosis; green hydra; holobiont; mutagenesis; stress tolerance; echinoderm; identification method; mutation; phenotype; symbiont; symbiosis; tolerance; anthozoa; hydra viridis,No
The compositions of rhizosphere microbiomes of wild and cultivated soybeans changed following the hybridization of their F1 and F2 generations,"Tian L, Shi S, Sun Y, Tran L-SP, Tian C",2020,Article,10.1016/j.ejsobi.2020.103249,"Soybean is considered as one of the most important food for both humans and animals; unfortunately, it faces soil-borne diseases caused by bacteria or fungi, leading to severe yield losses. Hybridization has helped the soybean to obtain beneficial genes from wild species that can resist some adverse conditions. However, the influences of hybridization on the rhizosphere microbiomes of wild and cultivated soybeans have not been much elucidated until now. In this article, we investigated the influences of hybridization of wild and cultivated soybeans on the rhizosphere microbiomes using four soybean genotypes: the cultivated soybean (C), the wild soybean (W), the first hybridization generation (F1) and the second hybridization generation (F2). Results indicated that there had significant differences in both the fungal and bacterial communities in all four groups. More specifically, bacterial and fungal communities were more similar between the F2 generation and wild soybean groups. The relative abundances of Glomeromycota in wild soybean and F2 generation were significantly higher than those in C and F1 groups. Furthermore, the network analysis showed that the wild soybean had more complicated bacterial and fungal connections than other genotypes, which might help wild soybean maintain the beneficial traits of resistance to adverse conditions. Results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for recognizing the different members of the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities of wild and cultivated soybeans, as well as their offspring. Additionally, our findings will hopefully provide a practical guide for screening useful microbial resources from the wild soybean rhizomicrobiome. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS",cultivated soybean; hybridization; microbiome; rhizosphere; wild soybean; ,No
Biochemical foundations of health and energy conservation in hibernating free-ranging subadult brown bear ursus arctos,"Welinder KG, Hansen R, Overgaard MT, Brohus M, Sønderkær M, Von Bergen M, Rolle-Kampczyk U, Otto W, Lindahl TL, Arinell K, Evans AL, Swenson JE, Revsbech IG, Frøbert O",2016,Article,10.1074/jbc.M116.742916,"Brown bears (Ursus arctos) hibernate for 5-7 months without eating, drinking, urinating, and defecating at a metabolic rate of only 25% of the summer activity rate. Nonetheless, they emerge healthy and alertinspring. Wequantified the biochemical adaptations for hibernation by comparing the proteome, metabolome, and hematological features of blood from hibernating and active free-ranging subadult brown bears with a focus on conservation of health and energy. We found that total plasma protein concentration increased during hibernation, even though the concentrations of most individual plasma proteins decreased, as did the white blood cell types. Strikingly, antimicrobial defense proteins increased in concentration. Central functions inhibernation involving the coagulation response and protease inhibition, as well as lipid transport and metabolism, were upheld by increased levels of very few key or broad specificity proteins. The changes incoagulation factor levels matched the changes in activity measurements. A dramatic 45-fold increase in sex hormone-binding globulin levels during hibernation draws, for the first time, attention to its significant but unknown role in maintaining hibernation physiology. We propose that energy for the costly protein synthesis is reduced by three mechanisms as follows: (i) dehydration, which increases protein concentration without de novo synthesis; (ii) reduced protein degradation rates due to a 6°C reduction in body temperature and decreased protease activity; and (iii) a marked redistribution of energy resources only increasing de novo synthesis of a few key proteins.

BCAP inhibits proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitors in the steady state and during demand situations,"Duggan JM, Buechler MB, Olson RM, Hohl TM, Hamerman JA",2017,Article,10.1182/blood-2016-06-719823,"B-cell adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (BCAP) is a signaling adaptor expressed in mature hematopoietic cells, including monocytes and neutrophils. Here we investigated the role of BCAP in the homeostasis and development of these myeloid lineages. BCAP-/- mice had more bone marrow (BM) monocytes than wild-type (WT) mice, and in mixed WT:BCAP-/- BM chimeras, monocytes and neutrophils skewed toward BCAP-/- origin, showing a competitive advantage for BCAP-/- myeloid cells. BCAP was expressed in BM hematopoietic progenitors, including lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK), common myeloid progenitor, and granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) cells. At the steady state, BCAP-/- GMPcells expressed more IRF8 and less C/EBPα than did WT GMP cells, which correlated with an increase in monocyte progenitors and a decrease in granulocyte progenitors among GMP cells. Strikingly, BCAP-/- progenitors proliferated and produced more myeloid cells of both neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage lineages than did WT progenitors in myeloid colony-forming unit assays, supporting a cell-intrinsic role of BCAP in inhibiting myeloid proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with these findings, during cyclophosphamide-induced myeloablation or specific monocyte depletion, BCAP-/- mice replenished circulating monocytes and neutrophils earlier than WT mice. During myeloid replenishment after cyclophosphamide-induced myeloablation, BCAP-/- mice had increased LSK proliferation and increased numbers of LSK and GMP cells compared with WT mice. Furthermore, BCAP-/- mice accumulated more monocytes and neutrophils in the spleen than did WT mice during Listeria monocytogenes infection. Together, these data identify BCAP as a novel inhibitor of myelopoiesis in the steady state and of emergency myelopoiesis during demand conditions. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.","; b cell adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; ccaat enhancer binding protein alpha; cyclophosphamide; guanosine phosphate; interferon consensus sequence binding protein; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; stem cell antigen 1; stem cell factor; unclassified drug; pik3ap1 protein, mouse; signal transducing adaptor protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell proliferation; cfu counting; chimera; controlled study; homeostasis; in vitro study; in vivo study; monocyte; mouse; myeloid progenitor cell; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; spleen cell; steady state; wild type; animal; cytology; myeloid progenitor cell; myelopoiesis; physiology; adaptor proteins, signal transducing; animals; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell proliferation; homeostasis; mice; monocytes; myeloid progenitor cells; myelopoiesis; neutrophils",No

Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that cKO mice had abnormal microflora with an increase of some genera. Consistently, expression of antimicrobial or antiparasitic peptides such as angiogenin-4, Relmβ, intelectin-1, and intelectin-2 as well as that of their inducer cytokines was significantly reduced in the cKO mice. Furthermore, secretion of colonic mucins that function as a mucosal barrier against bacterial invasion was also significantly diminished in cKO mice.

Heliconius Butterflies Host Characteristic and Phylogenetically Structured Adult-Stage Microbiomes,"Hammer TJ, Dickerson JC, McMillan WO, Fierer N",2020,Article,10.1128/AEM.2007-20,"Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are diverse and ecologically important, yet we know little about how they interact with microbes as adults. Due to metamorphosis, the form and function of their adult-stage microbiomes might be very different from those of microbiomes in the larval stage (caterpillars). We studied adult-stage microbiomes of Heliconius and closely related passion-vine butterflies (Heliconiini), which are an important model system in evolutionary biology. To characterize the structure and dynamics of heliconiine microbiomes, we used field collections of wild butterflies, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative PCR, and shotgun metagenomics. We found that Heliconius butterflies harbor simple and abundant bacterial communities that are moderately consistent among conspecific individuals and over time. Heliconiine microbiomes also exhibited a strong signal of the host phylogeny, with a major distinction between Heliconius and other butterflies. These patterns were largely driven by differing relative abundances of bacterial phylotypes shared among host species and genera, as opposed to the presence or absence of host-specific phylotypes. We suggest that the phylogenetic structure in heliconiine microbiomes arises from conserved host traits that differentially filter microbes from the environment. While the relative importance of different traits remains unclear, our data indicate that pollen feeding (unique to Heliconius) is not a primary driver. Using shotgun metagenomics, we also discovered trypanosomatids and microsporidia to be prevalent in butterfly guts, raising the possibility of antagonistic interactions between eukaryotic parasites and colocalized gut bacteria. Our discovery of characteristic and phylogenetically structured microbiomes provides a foundation for tests of adult-stage microbiome function, a poorly understood aspect of lepidopteran biology. © 2020.

Microbial associations and spatial proximity predict North American moose (Alces alces) gastrointestinal community composition,"Fountain-Jones NM, Clark NJ, Kinsley AC, Carstensen M, Forester J, Johnson TJ, Miller EA, Moore S, Wolf TM, Craft ME",2020,Article,10.1111/1365-2656.13154,"Microbial communities are increasingly recognized as crucial for animal health. However, our understanding of how microbial communities are structured across wildlife populations is poor. Mechanisms such as interspecific associations are important in structuring free-living communities, but we still lack an understanding of how important interspecific associations are in structuring gut microbial communities in comparison with other factors such as host characteristics or spatial proximity of hosts. Here, we ask how gut microbial communities are structured in a population of North American moose Alces alces. We identify key microbial interspecific associations within the moose gut and quantify how important they are relative to key host characteristics, such as body condition, for predicting microbial community composition. We sampled gut microbial communities from 55 moose in a population experiencing decline due to a myriad of factors, including pathogens and malnutrition. We examined microbial community dynamics in this population utilizing novel graphical network models that can explicitly incorporate spatial information. We found that interspecific associations were the most important mechanism structuring gut microbial communities in moose and detected both positive and negative associations. Models only accounting for associations between microbes had higher predictive value compared to models including moose sex, evidence of previous pathogen exposure or body condition. Adding spatial information on moose location further strengthened our model and allowed us to predict microbe occurrences with ~90% accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that microbial interspecific associations coupled with host spatial proximity are vital in shaping gut microbial communities in a large herbivore. In this case, previous pathogen exposure and moose body condition were not as important in predicting gut microbial community composition. The approach applied here can be used to quantify interspecific associations and gain a more nuanced understanding of the spatial and host factors shaping microbial communities in non-model hosts. © 2019 British Ecological Society","biotic interactions; body condition; co-occurrence networks; markov random fields; microbiome; pathogens; spatial analysis; biotic factor; body condition; coexistence; community composition; community structure; deer; digestive system; microbial activity; microbial community; microorganism; pathogen; prediction; spatial analysis; wildlife management; alces alces; alces alces americana; animalia; animal; deer; gastrointestinal tract; herbivory; microflora; united states; wild animal; animals; animals, wild; deer; gastrointestinal tract; herbivory; microbiota; united states",No
"Diet, habitat environment and lifestyle conversion affect the gut microbiomes of giant pandas","Jin L, Huang Y, Yang S, Wu D, Li C, Deng W, Zhao K, He Y, Li B, Zhang G, Xiong Y, Wei R, Li G, Wu H, Zhang H, Zou L",2021,Article,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145316,"Gut microbiota (GM) are important for the health of giant pandas (GPs), in addition to the utilization of bamboo in their diets. However, it is not fully understood how diet, habitat environment and lifestyle contribute to the composition of GM in GP. Consequently, we evaluated how dietary changes, habitat environment conversions and lifestyle shifts influence the GM of GPs using high-throughput sequencing and genome-resolved metagenomics. The GM of GPs were more similar when their hosts exhibited the same diet. High fiber diets significantly increased the diversity and decreased the richness of gut bacterial communities alone or interacted with the age factor (p < 0.05). The abundances of Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium significantly increased during diet conversion process (Non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, LDA > 4). Reconstruction of 60 metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) indicated that these bacteria were likely responsible for bamboo digestion via gene complements involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin degradation. While habitat environment may play a more important role in shaping the GM of GP, lifestyle can also greatly affect bacterial communities. The GM structure in reintroduced GPs notably converged to that of wild pandas. Importantly, the main bacterial genera of wild GPs could aid in lignin degradation, while those of reintroduced GPs were related to cellulose and hemicellulose digestion. Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium may contribute to lignocellulose digestion in GP. The results revealed that diet conversion, habitat environment and lifestyle could remarkably influence the GM of GP. In addition, results suggested that increasing the ability of lignin degradation with GM may aid to change the GM of reintroduced pandas to resemble those of wild pandas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",diet conversion; giant panda; gut microbiota; habitat environment; lifestyle; bamboo; biodegradation; cellulose; clostridium; lignin; bacterial community; bacterial genus; cellulose and hemicellulose; conversion process; dietary changes; high-throughput sequencing; lignin degradation; non-parametric; ecosystems; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; cellulose; dietary intake; habitat management; lifestyle; mammal; microbial activity; acinetobacter; article; clostridium; controlled study; dietary intake; enterococcus; giant panda; high fiber diet; high throughput sequencing; intestine flora; lactococcus; lifestyle modification; metagenome; microbial community; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; protein degradation; pseudomonas; species habitat; species richness; streptococcus; animal; bear; diet; ecosystem; lifestyle; bamboo; biodegradation; cellulose; conversion; digestion; ecosystems; processes; acinetobacter; ailuropoda melanoleuca; bacteria (microorganisms); clostridium; enterococcus; lactococcus; microbiota; pseudomonas; streptococcus; animals; diet; ecosystem; gastrointestinal microbiome; life style; ursidae,Yes
High-fat diet-induced obesity exacerbates inflammatory bowel disease in genetically susceptible mdr1a-/- male mice,"Paik J, Fierce Y, Treuting PM, Brabb T, Maggio-Price L",2013,Article,10.3945/jn.113.174615,"Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease and a risk factor for disorders such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. A highfat diet (HFD), a risk factor for obesity, has also been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A proinflammatory state characterized by systemic and local increases in cytokine and chemokine levels are noted in both obesity and IBD, but it is unclear whether obesity is a risk factor for IBD. To examine any association between obesity and IBD, we chose FVB.129P2- Abcb1atm1BorN7 (Mdr1a-/-)mice, because this strain develops IBD spontaneously with age without a chemical or bacterial ''trigger.'' In addition, its background strain, FVB, has been used for diet-induced obesity studies. Mdr1a-/- mice and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a HFD (~60%calories from fat) or a low-fat diet (LFD~11%calories from fat) for 12 wk. Obesity phenotypes examined included body weight measurements, glucose metabolism changes, and adiposity at termination of the study. IBD was determined by clinical signs, necropsy, and histopathology. We found that compared with those fed the LFD, both the Mdr1a-/- and WT mice fed the HFD had greater weight gains and elevated plasma leptin concentrations (P &lt; 0.0001).When all mice were analyzed,weight gainwas also associatedwith inflammation in mesenteric fat (R2 = 0.5; P &lt; 0.0001) and mesenteric lymph nodes (R2 = 0.4; P &lt; 0.0001).

Immune responses upon Campylobacter jejuni infection of secondary abiotic mice lacking nucleotide-oligomerization-domain-2,"Bereswill S, Grundmann U, Alutis ME, Fischer A, Kühl AA, Heimesaat MM",2017,Article,10.1186/s13099-017-0182-0,"Background: Campylobacter jejuni infections are of rising importance worldwide. Given that innate immune receptors including nucleotide-oligomerization-domain-2 (Nod2) are essentially involved in combating enteropathogenic infections, we here surveyed the impact of Nod2 in murine campylobacteriosis. Methods and results: In order to overcome physiological colonization resistance preventing from C. jejuni infection, we generated secondary abiotic Nod2−/− and wildtype (WT) mice by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Mice were then perorally infected with C. jejuni strain 81-176 on 2 consecutive days and could be stably colonized by the pathogen at high loads. Notably, Nod2 deficiency did not affect gastrointestinal colonization properties of C. jejuni. Despite high intestinal pathogenic burdens mice were virtually uncompromised and exhibited fecal blood in single cases only. At day 7 postinfection (p.i.) similar increases in numbers of colonic epithelial apoptotic cells could be observed in mice of either genotype, whereas C. jejuni infected Nod2−/− mice displayed more distinct regenerative properties in the colon than WT controls. C. jejuni infection was accompanied by increases in distinct immune cell populations such as T lymphocytes and regulatory T cells in mice of either genotype. Increases in T lymphocytes, however, were less pronounced in large intestines of Nod2−/− mice at day 7 p.i. when compared to WT mice, whereas colonic numbers of B lymphocytes were elevated in WT controls only upon C. jejuni infection. At day 7 p.i., colonic pro-inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, TNF, IFN-γ and IL-22 increased more distinctly in Nod2−/− as compared to WT mice, whereas C. jejuni induced IL-23p19 and IL-18 levels were lower in the large intestines of the former. Converse to the colon, however, ileal concentrations of nitric oxide, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 were lower in Nod2−/− as compared to WT mice at day 7 p.i. Even though MUC2 was down-regulated in C. jejuni infected Nod2−/− mice, this did not result in increased pathogenic translocation from the intestinal tract to extra-intestinal compartments. Conclusion: In secondary abiotic mice, Nod2 signaling is involved in the orchestrated host immune responses upon C. jejuni infection, but does not control pathogen loads in the gastrointestinal tract. © 2017 The Author(s).",adaptive immune cells; apoptosis; bacterial colonization properties; bacterial translocation; campylobacter jejuni; il-23/il-22/il-18 axis; mucin-2; nucleotide-oligomerization-domain-2 (nod2); pro-inflammatory cytokines; secondary abiotic (gnotobiotic) mice; ,No
Enterococcus faecalis gluconate phosphotransferase system accelerates experimental colitis and bacterial killing by macrophages,"Fan T-J, Goeser L, Naziripour A, Redinbo MR, Hansen JJ",2019,Article,10.1128/IAI.00080-19,"Enterococcus faecalis strains are resident intestinal bacteria associated with invasive infections, inflammatory bowel diseases, and colon cancer. Although factors promoting E. faecalis colonization of intestines are not fully known, one implicated pathway is a phosphotransferase system (PTS) in E. faecalis strain OG1RF that phosphorylates gluconate and contains the genes OG1RF_12399 to OG1RF_ 12402 (OG1RF_12399-12402). We hypothesize that this PTS permits growth in gluconate, facilitates E. faecalis intestinal colonization, and exacerbates colitis. We generated E. faecalis strains containing deletions/point mutations in this PTS and measured bacterial growth and PTS gene expression in minimal medium supplemented with selected carbohydrates. We show that E. faecalis upregulates OG1RF_ 12399 transcription specifically in the presence of gluconate and that E. faecalis strains lacking, or harboring a single point mutation in, OG1RF_12399-12402 are unable to grow in minimal medium containing gluconate. We colonized germfree wild-type and colitis-prone interleukin-10-deficient mice with defined bacterial consortia containing the E. faecalis strains and measured inflammation and bacterial abundance in the colon. We infected macrophage and intestinal epithelial cell lines with the E. faecalis strains and measured intracellular bacterial survival and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. The presence of OG1RF_12399-12402 is not required for E. faecalis colonization of the mouse intestine but is associated with an accelerated onset of experimental colitis in interleukin-10-deficient mice, altered bacterial composition in the colon, enhanced E. faecalis survival within macrophages, and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion by colon tissue and macrophages. Further studies of bacterial carbohydrate metabolism in general, and E. faecalis PTS-gluconate in particular, during inflammation may identify new mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.

New insights on the zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett) bacteriome,"Asimakis E, Stathopoulou P, Sapounas A, Khaeso K, Batargias C, Khan M, Tsiamis G",2021,Article,10.3390/microorganisms9030659,"Various factors, including the insect host, diet, and surrounding ecosystem can shape the structure of the bacterial communities of insects. We have employed next generation, high‐through-put sequencing of the 16S rRNA to characterize the bacteriome of wild Zeugodacus (Bactrocera) cu-curbitae (Coquillett) flies from three regions of Bangladesh. The tested populations developed distinct bacterial communities with differences in bacterial composition, suggesting that geography has an impact on the fly bacteriome. The dominant bacteria belonged to the families Enterobacteri-aceae, Dysgomonadaceae and Orbaceae, with the genera Dysgonomonas, Orbus and Citrobacter show-ing the highest relative abundance across populations. Network analysis indicated variable interactions between operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with cases of mutual exclusion and copresence. Certain bacterial genera with high relative abundance were also characterized by a high degree of interactions. Interestingly, genera with a low relative abundance like Shimwellia, Gilliamella, and Chishuiella were among those that showed abundant interactions, suggesting that they are also important components of the bacterial community. Such knowledge could help us identify ideal wild populations for domestication in the context of the sterile insect technique or similar biotechnolog-ical methods. Further characterization of this bacterial diversity with transcriptomic and metabolic approaches, could also reveal their specific role in Z. cucurbitae physiology. © 2021 by the authors.

Overexpression of pEGF improved the gut protective function of Clostridium butyricum partly through STAT3 signal pathway,"Ma M, Zhao Z, Liang Q, Shen H, Zhao Z, Chen Z, He R, Feng S, Cao D, Gan G, Ye H, Qiu W, Deng J, Ming F, Jia J, Sun C, Li J, Zhang L",2021,Article,10.1007/s00253-021-11472-y,"Abstract: Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum) is a probiotic that could promote animal growth and protect gut health. So far, current studies mainly keep up with the basic biological functions of C. butyricum, missing the effective strategy to further improve its protective efficiency. A recent report about C. butyricum alleviating intestinal injury through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inspired us to bridge this gap by porcine epidermal growth factor (EGF) overexpression. Lacking a secretory overexpression system, we constructed the recombinant strains overexpressing pEGF in C. butyricum for the first time and obtained 4 recombinant strains for highly efficient secretion of pEGF (BC/pPD1, BC/pSPP, BC/pGHF, and BC/pDBD). Compared to the wild-type strain, we confirmed that the expression level ranges of the intestinal development–related genes (Claudin-1, GLUT-2, SUC, GLP2R, and EGFR) and anti-inflammation-related gene (IL-10) in IPECs were upregulated under recombinant strain stimulation, and the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium was significantly inhibited as well. Furthermore, a particular inhibitor (stattic) was used to block STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the downregulation on antibacterial effect of recombinant strains. This study demonstrated that the secretory overexpression of pEGF in C. butyricum could upregulate the expression level of EGFR, consequently improving the intestinal protective functions of C. butyricum partly following STAT3 signal activation in IPECs and making it a positive loop. These findings on the overexpression strains pointed out a new direction for further development and utilization of C. butyricum. Key points: • By 12 signal peptide screening in silico, 4 pEGF overexpression strains of C. butyricum/pMTL82151-pEGF for highly efficient secretion of pEGF were generated for the first time. • The secretory overexpression of pEGF promoted the intestinal development, antimicrobial action, and anti-inflammatory function of C. butyricum. • The overexpressed pEGF upregulated the expression level of EGFR and further magnified the gut protective function of recombinant strains which in turn partly depended on STAT3 signal pathway in IPECs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",antibacterial activity; clostridium butyricum; epidermal growth factor receptor; il-6/il-10; stat3; amino acids; genes; probiotics; salmonella; well stimulation; anti-inflammatory function; development and utilizations; epidermal growth factor receptors; epidermal growth factors; intestinal development; overexpression systems; salmonella typhimurium; tyrosine phosphorylation; clostridium; bacterium; digestive system disorder; gene expression; inhibitor; probiotics; clostridium butyricum; salmonella typhimurium; staphylococcus aureus; epidermal growth factor; probiotic agent; signal peptide; animal; clostridium butyricum; pig; signal transduction; animals; clostridium butyricum; epidermal growth factor; probiotics; protein sorting signals; signal transduction; swine,No
Innate immune responses to gut microbiota differ between oceanic and freshwater threespine stickleback populations,"Milligan-Myhre K, Small CM, Mittge EK, Agarwal M, Currey M, Cresko WA, Guillemin K",2016,Article,10.1242/dmm.021881,"Animal hosts must co-exist with beneficial microbes while simultaneously being able to mount rapid, non-specific, innate immune responses to pathogenic microbes. How this balance is achieved is not fully understood, and disruption of this relationship can lead to disease. Excessive inflammatory responses to resident microbes are characteristic of certain gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The immune dysregulation of IBD has complex genetic underpinnings that cannot be fully recapitulated with single-gene-knockout models. A deeper understanding of the genetic regulation of innate immune responses to resident microbes requires the ability to measure immune responses in the presence and absence of the microbiota using vertebrate models with complex genetic variation. Here, we describe a new gnotobiotic vertebrate model to explore the natural genetic variation that contributes to differences in innate immune responses to microbiota. Threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, has been used to study the developmental genetics of complex traits during the repeated evolution from ancestral oceanic to derived freshwater forms. We established methods to rear germ-free stickleback larvae and gnotobiotic animals monoassociated with single bacterial isolates. We characterized the innate immune response of these fish to resident gut microbes by quantifying the neutrophil cells in conventionally reared monoassociated or germ-free stickleback from both oceanic and freshwater populations grown in a common intermediate salinity environment. We found that oceanic and freshwater fish in the wild and in the laboratory share many intestinal microbial community members. However, oceanic fish mount a strong immune response to residential microbiota, whereas freshwater fish frequently do not. A strong innate immune response was uniformly observed across oceanic families, but this response varied among families of freshwater fish. The gnotobiotic stickleback model that we have developed therefore provides a platform for future studies mapping the natural genetic basis of the variation in immune response to microbes. © 2016 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","animal model; fish; germ-free; gnotobiotic; neutrophils; stickleback; fresh water; fresh water; sea water; adult; animal tissue; article; bacterium isolate; developmental genetics; fish model; gasterosteus aculeatus; genetic variability; gnotobiotics; innate immunity; intestine flora; microbial community; neutrophil; nonhuman; priority journal; salinity; animal; fish; intestine; microbiology; microflora; animals; fishes; fresh water; immunity, innate; intestines; microbiota; seawater",No
Potentiation of serotonin signaling leads to increased carbohydrate and lipid absorption in the murine small intestine,"Park CJ, Armenia SJ, Shaughnessy MP, Greig CJ, Cowles RA",2019,Article,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2019.02.027,"Background: Enteric serotonin influences intestinal homeostasis and functions as a mucosal growth factor. Previously, we demonstrated increased mucosal surface area and enhanced crypt cell proliferation in serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT)-deficient mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that serotonin-mediated mucosal growth would also result in enhanced carbohydrate and lipid absorption. Material and methods: Wild-type C57Bl/6 (WT)and SERT-knockout (SERTKO)mice were fasted then gavaged with D-xylose or boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)FL-C12 medium-chain fatty acid analog. Serum D-xylose and BODIPY concentrations were serially measured from blood drawn at 30 to 360 min post-gavage. Small intestine was harvested from both groups for comparison of morphometric parameters. Area under the curve of plotted graphs was calculated, and means were compared with Student's t-test to a significance of p < 0.05. Results: Villus height and crypt depth were significantly greater in the middle and distal small intestine of SERTKO animals compared to WT. Overall absorption of D-xylose and BODIPY was greater in SERTKO animals compared to WT animals. Absorption of D-xylose was persistently elevated in SERTKO animals, while there was an initial delay in BODIPY absorption followed by a sustained and significantly greater absorption in SERTKO animals at 60–360 min after gavage. Conclusion: Potentiation of serotonin signaling in SERTKO mice results in small intestinal mucosal growth and enhanced carbohydrate and fat absorption in vivo. These functional increases support the concept of targeting the serotonin signaling system to augment intestinal adaptation in the setting of intestinal failure. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","absorption; carbohydrate; growth factor; intestinal mucosa; lipid; serotonin reuptake transporter (sert); boron dipyrromethene fl c12; carbohydrate; lipid; medium chain fatty acid; serotonin; serotonin reuptake transporter; serotonin transporter; unclassified drug; xylose; serotonin; serotonin transporter; animal experiment; animal tissue; anthropometric parameters; article; blood level; carbohydrate absorption; comparative study; controlled study; female; intestine crypt; intestine villus; lipid absorption; male; morphometry; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; serotonin signaling; signal transduction; small intestine; small intestine absorption; small intestine mucosa; villus height; wild type mouse; animal; c57bl mouse; carbohydrate diet; fat intake; genetics; knockout mouse; metabolism; physiology; signal transduction; animals; dietary carbohydrates; dietary fats; intestine, small; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; serotonin; serotonin plasma membrane transport proteins; signal transduction",No

Interspecific patterns of variation are more variable, with significantly diverged communities for most species' comparisons, apart from the comparison between coastal cod (NCC) and Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii), whose community compositions are not significantly diverged.

Holocranohistochemistry enables the visualization of α-synuclein expression in the murine olfactory system and discovery of its systemic anti-microbial effects,"Tomlinson JJ, Shutinoski B, Dong L, Meng F, Elleithy D, Lengacher NA, Nguyen AP, Cron GO, Jiang Q, Roberson ED, Nussbaum RL, Majbour NK, El-Agnaf OM, Bennett SA, Lagace DC, Woulfe JM, Sad S, Brown EG, Schlossmacher MG",2017,Article,10.1007/s00702-017-1726-7,"Braak and Del Tredici have proposed that typical Parkinson disease (PD) has its origins in the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal tract. However, the role of the olfactory system has insufficiently been explored in the pathogeneses of PD and Alzheimer disease (AD) in laboratory models. Here, we demonstrate applications of a new method to process mouse heads for microscopy by sectioning, mounting, and staining whole skulls (‘holocranohistochemistry’). This technique permits the visualization of the olfactory system from the nasal cavity to mitral cells and dopamine-producing interneurons of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. We applied this method to two specific goals: first, to visualize PD- and AD-linked gene expression in the olfactory system, where we detected abundant, endogenous α-synuclein and tau expression in the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, we observed amyloid-β plaques and proteinase-K-resistant α-synuclein species, respectively, in cranial nerve-I of APP- and human SNCA-over-expressing mice. The second application of the technique was to the modeling of gene–environment interactions in the nasal cavity of mice. We tracked the infection of a neurotropic respiratory-enteric-orphan virus from the nose pad into cranial nerves-I (and -V) and monitored the ensuing brain infection. Given its abundance in the olfactory epithelia, we questioned whether α-synuclein played a role in innate host defenses to modify the outcome of infections. Indeed, Snca-null mice were more likely to succumb to viral encephalitis versus their wild-type littermates. Moreover, using a bacterial sepsis model, Snca-null mice were less able to control infection after intravenous inoculation with Salmonella typhimurium. Together, holocranohistochemistry enabled new discoveries related to α-synuclein expression and its function in mice. Future studies will address: the role of Mapt and mutant SNCA alleles in infection paradigms; the contribution of xenobiotics in the initiation of idiopathic PD; and the safety to the host when systemically targeting α-synuclein by immunotherapy. © 2017, The Author(s).","alzheimer disease; app/aβ; exposome; genome; histology; infection; inoculation; mapt/tau; neuropathology; parkinson disease; snca/α-synuclein; susceptibility; synucleinopathy; alpha synuclein; amyloid beta protein; dopamine; leucine rich repeat kinase 2; microtubule associated protein; proteinase k; tau protein; alpha synuclein; amyloid precursor protein; app protein, human; snca protein, human; snca protein, mouse; adult; allele; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell inclusion; controlled study; dendrite; gene expression; genotype environment interaction; histochemistry; holocranohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; infection control; innate immunity; interneuron; mesencephalon; mitral cell; mouse; neostriatum; nonhuman; nose cavity; nose infection; olfactory bulb; olfactory epithelium; olfactory nerve; olfactory receptor neuron; priority journal; protein expression; reoviridae; reovirus infection; salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium; salmonellosis; substantia nigra; trigeminal nerve; 129 mouse; anatomy and histology; animal; brain; c57bl mouse; diagnostic imaging; disease model; female; genetics; head; human; immunohistochemistry; immunology; male; mammalian orthoreovirus 3; metabolism; mortality; nerve tract; olfactory mucosa; pathology; procedures; tissue preservation; transgenic mouse; virology; virus encephalitis; alpha-synuclein; amyloid beta-protein precursor; animals; brain; disease models, animal; encephalitis, viral; female; head; humans; immunohistochemistry; male; mammalian orthoreovirus 3; mice; mice, 129 strain; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, transgenic; neural pathways; olfactory mucosa; olfactory receptor neurons; reoviridae infections; salmonella infections; salmonella typhimurium; tissue preservation",No
Genetic manipulation of wild human gut bacteroides,"Bencivenga-Barry NA, Lim B, Herrera CM, Stephen Trent M, Goodman AL",2020,Article,10.1128/JB.00544-19,"Bacteroides is one of the most prominent genera in the human gut microbiome, and study of this bacterial group provides insights into gut microbial ecology and pathogenesis. In this report, we introduce a negative selection system for rapid and efficient allelic exchange in wild Bacteroides species that does not require any alterations to the genetic background or a nutritionally defined culture medium. In this approach, dual antibacterial effectors normally delivered via type VI secretion are targeted to the bacterial periplasm under the control of tightly regulated anhydrotetracycline (aTC)-inducible promoters. Introduction of aTC selects for recombination events producing the desired genetic modification, and the dual effector design allows for broad applicability across strains that may have immunity to one counterselection effector. We demonstrate the utility of this approach across 21 human gut Bacteroides isolates representing diverse species, including strains isolated directly from human donors. We use this system to establish that antimicrobial peptide resistance in Bacteroides vulgatus is determined by the product of a gene that is not included in the genomes of previously genetically tractable members of the human gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE Human gut Bacteroides species exhibit strain-level differences in their physiology, ecology, and impact on human health and disease. However, existing approaches for genetic manipulation generally require construction of genetically modified parental strains for each microbe of interest or defined medium formulations. In this report, we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for targeted genetic manipulation of diverse wild-type Bacteroides species from the human gut.

Chemotaxis allows bacteria to overcome host-generated reactive oxygen species that constrain gland colonization,"Collins KD, Hu S, Grasberger H, Kao JY, Ottemann KM",2018,Article,10.1128/IAI.00878-17,"The epithelial layer of the gastrointestinal tract contains invaginations, called glands or crypts, which are colonized by symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms and may function as designated niches for certain species. Factors that control gland colonization are poorly understood, but bacterial chemotaxis aids occupation of these sites. We report here that a Helicobacter pylori cytoplasmic chemoreceptor, TlpD, is required for gland colonization in the stomach. tlpD mutants demonstrate gland colonization defects characterized by a reduction in the percentage of glands colonized but not in the number of bacteria per gland. Consistent with TlpD's reported role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) avoidance, tlpD mutants showed hallmarks of exposure to high ROS. To assess the role of host-generated ROS in TlpD-dependent gland colonization, we utilized mice that lack either the ability to generate epithelial hydrogen peroxide or immune cell superoxide. tlpD gland colonization defects were rescued to wild-type H. pylori levels in both of these mutants. These results suggest that multiple types of innate immune-generated ROS production limit gland colonization and that bacteria have evolved specific mechanisms to sense and direct their motility in response to this signal and thus spread throughout tissue. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.","biogeography; chemoreceptors; crypts; glands; mcp; reactive oxygen species; signal transduction; stomach; bacterial protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal; bacterial gene; chemotaxis; female; gene expression regulation; genetics; helicobacter pylori; heterozygote; human; knockout mouse; male; metabolism; microbiology; mouse; mutation; physiology; stomach mucosa; animals; bacterial proteins; carrier state; chemotaxis; female; gastric mucosa; gene expression regulation; genes, bacterial; helicobacter pylori; humans; male; mice; mice, knockout; mutation; reactive oxygen species",No
Mechanisms of defense against products of cysteine catabolism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,"Livshits L, Chatterjee AK, Karbian N, Abergel R, Abergel Z, Gross E",2017,Article,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.02.007,"Cysteine catabolism presents cells with a double-edged sword. On the one hand, cysteine degradation provides cells with essential molecules such as taurine and sulfide. The formation of sulfide in cells is thought to regulate important and diverse physiological processes including blood circulation, synaptic activity and inflammation. On the other hand, the catabolism of cysteine by gut microbiota can release high levels of sulfide that may underlie the development or relapse of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Here, we have used the nematode C. elegans to explore how cells tolerate high levels of sulfide produced by cysteine degradation in bacteria. We have identified mutations in genes coding for thioredoxin family proteins, mitochondrial proteins, and collagens that confer tolerance to sulfide toxicity. Exposure to sulfide induces the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Moreover, our results suggest that sulfide toxicity is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, pre-treatment of worms with antioxidants increases their tolerance to sulfide toxicity. Intriguingly, sub-toxic levels of the superoxide generator paraquat can also increase the tolerance of worms to sulfide. Therefore, it appears that activation of ROS detoxification pathway prior to the exposure to sulfide, can increase the tolerance to sulfide toxicity. Our results suggest that these detoxification pathways are mediated by the hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1. Finally, we show that sulfide resistance varies among wild C. elegans and other nematode species, suggesting that tolerance to sulfide was naturally selected in certain habitats. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","; acetylcysteine; adenosine triphosphate; butylated hydroxyanisole; chloramphenicol; cysteine; diamide; lead acetate; oligomycin; oxygen; paraquat; phenformin; reactive oxygen metabolite; rotenone; sulfide; superoxide; tert butyl hydroperoxide; thiol; thiol oxidase; thioredoxin; antioxidant; caenorhabditis elegans protein; cysteine; hif-1 protein, c elegans; hydrogen sulfide; paraquat; sulfide; transcription factor; amino acid metabolism; article; bacillus subtilis; caenorhabditis elegans; comparative study; controlled study; detoxification; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; enzyme activity; escherichia coli; gene expression; gene mutation; larval stage; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; phenotype; priority journal; promoter region; retention time; shewanella oneidensis; signal transduction; survival; survival rate; unfolded protein response; animal; caenorhabditis elegans; drug effects; genetics; intestine flora; longevity; metabolism; mitochondrion; mutation; pathology; animals; antioxidants; caenorhabditis elegans; caenorhabditis elegans proteins; cysteine; endoplasmic reticulum; gastrointestinal microbiome; hydrogen sulfide; longevity; metabolism; mitochondria; mutation; paraquat; reactive oxygen species; sulfides; transcription factors",No
The microbial reproductive ecology of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus),"Mallott EK, Amato KR",2018,Article,10.1002/ajp.22896,"Changes in reproductive status influence energy and nutrient requirements in female primates. The gut microbiota may buffer changes in energy demands, with shifts in community composition increasing the energy production potential of the gut during pregnancy and lactation. In this study, we examine changes in the gut microbiome of wild, female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) across different reproductive states. Fecal samples (n = 39) were collected from five adult females over the course of a year. Gut microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequences, and PICRUSt was used to make metagenomic functional predictions. We found a significant relationship between reproductive state and both the structure and predicted function of the gut microbiome, neither of which were associated with host diet. For example, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was significantly lower in lactating females compared with cycling females; the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly higher in pregnant females compared with lactating females, and there was a trend toward higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria in pregnant females compared with cycling females. The results of this study suggest that, in addition to behavioral and dietary adaptions, the gut microbiota may play a role in allowing female primates to meet their changing energetic needs during reproduction.

Dysbiosis-induced intestinal inflammation activates tumor necrosis factor receptor I and mediates alcoholic liver disease in mice,"Chen P, Stärkel P, Turner JR, Ho SB, Schnabl B",2015,Article,10.1002/hep.27489,"Intestinal barrier dysfunction is an important contributor to alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Translocated microbial products trigger an inflammatory response in the liver and contribute to steatohepatitis. Our aim was to investigate mechanisms of barrier disruption after chronic alcohol feeding. A Lieber-DeCarli model was used to induce intestinal dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, and liver disease in mice. Alcohol feeding for 8 weeks induced intestinal inflammation in the jejunum, which is characterized by an increased number of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-producing monocytes and macrophages. These findings were confirmed in duodenal biopsies from patients with chronic alcohol abuse. Intestinal decontamination with nonabsorbable antibiotics restored eubiosis, decreased intestinal inflammation and permeability, and reduced ALD in mice. TNF-receptor I (TNFRI) mutant mice were protected from intestinal barrier dysfunction and ALD. To investigate whether TNFRI on intestinal epithelial cells mediates intestinal barrier dysfunction and ALD, we used TNFRI mutant mice carrying a conditional gain-of-function allele for this receptor. Reactivation of TNFRI on intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased intestinal permeability and liver disease that is similar to wild-type mice after alcohol feeding, suggesting that enteric TNFRI promotes intestinal barrier dysfunction. Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) is a downstream target of TNF-α and was phosphorylated in intestinal epithelial cells after alcohol administration. Using MLCK-deficient mice, we further demonstrate a partial contribution of MLCK to intestinal barrier dysfunction and liver disease after chronic alcohol feeding.

Fecal Bacteriome and Mycobiome in Bats with Diverse Diets in South China,"Li J, Li L, Jiang H, Yuan L, Zhang L, Ma J-E, Zhang X, Cheng M, Chen J",2018,Article,10.1007/s00284-018-1530-0,"Bats can be divided into frugivory, nectarivory, insectivory, and sanguivory based on their diets, and are therefore ideal wild animal models to study the relationship between diets and intestinal microflora. Early studies of bat gut bacteria showed that the diversity and structure of intestinal bacterial communities in bats are closely related to dietary changes. Worthy of note, intestinal microbes are composed of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. Although the number of gut fungi is much lower than that of gut bacteria, they also play an important role in maintaining the host homeostasis. However, there are still few reports on the relationship between the gut mycobiota and the dietary habits of the host. In addition, bats have also been shown to naturally transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria through their feces and saliva, but fungal infections from bat are less studied. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes in the V4 and V9 regions to characterize fecal bacterial and fungal microbiota in phytophagous and insectivorous bats in South China. The results show that the gut microbiota in bats were dominated by bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes, and fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. There was a significant difference in the diversity of bacterial and fungal microbiota between the groups, in addition to specific bacteria and fungi populations on each of them. Of note, the number of fungi in the feces of herbivorous bats is relatively higher. Most of these fungi are foodborne and are also pathogens of humans and other animals. Thus, bats are natural carriers of fungal pathogens.

The cytosolic sensor STING is required for intestinal homeostasis and control of inflammation,"Canesso MCC, Lemos L, Neves TC, Marim FM, Castro TBR, Veloso É, Queiroz CP, Ahn J, Santiago HC, Martins FS, Alves-Silva J, Ferreira E, Cara DC, Vieira AT, Barber GN, Oliveira SC, Faria AMC",2018,Article,10.1038/mi.2017.88,"STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a cytosolic sensor for cyclic dinucleotides and also an adaptor molecule for intracellular DNA receptors. Although STING has important functions in the host defense against pathogens and in autoimmune diseases, its physiological relevance in intestinal homeostasis is largely unknown. In this study, we show that STING '/' mice presented defective protective mechanisms of intestinal mucosa, including decreased number of goblet cells, diminished mucus production, and lower levels of secretory IgA, when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Fecal content and microbiota DNA could activate STING, indicating a role of this molecule in gut. Microbiota composition was altered in STING '/' mice toward a more inflammatory profile, evidencing a reduction in the Allobacolum and Bifidobacterium groups along with increase in Disulfovibrio bacteria. Absence of STING lead to decrease in induced intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and to increase in group 1 innate lymphoid cell (ILC1) as well as ILC3 frequencies and decrease in ILC2 in the colon. Development and function of Foxp3+ and LAP+ regulatory T cells were also compromised in STING '/' mice. Moreover, these mice were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, T-cell-induced colitis, and enteric Salmonella typhimurium infection when compared with WT animals.

Interleukin 17A deficiency alleviates fluoride-induced testicular injury by inhibiting the immune response and apoptosis,"Li Y, Zhao Y, Wang J, Cheng M, Wang J",2021,Article,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128178,"The reproductive toxicity of fluoride (F) has been verified by various epidemiological and experimental studies. Our previous work suggested that the interleukin 17A (IL-17A) is involved in the testicular damage induced by excessive F exposure. In this study, we further investigated the role of IL-17A in F-induced testicular injury. Wild type (WT) and IL-17A knockout (IL-17A-/-) mice were exposed to 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/L sodium fluoride (NaF) for 90 days. We found that exposure to excessive F levels caused testicular damage, decreased semen quality, negatively affected testicular morphology, and increased the inflammatory response. Specifically, excessive F intake increased the expression levels of IL-17A in the testis and increased the protein levels of Act1, NF-κB, IL-17R, C/EBP-α, and TRAF6 in the IL-17A signaling pathway. The increase in IL-17A expression corresponded to increases expression of IL-17R, IL-6, IL-23, IL-1β, TGF-β and TNF-α as assessed by RT-PCR and ELISA assays. Remarkably, IL-17A knockout in mice ameliorated the effects of F on testicular damage, semen quality, testicular morphology, and the immune response. Additionally, we found the in vitro exposure of Leydig cells to NaF and recombinant IL-17A led to abnormal apoptosis and a decrease in testosterone secretion. Our findings prove that IL-17A plays a key role in the exacerbation of testicular injuries in F-exposed mice, and that IL-17A deficiency can alleviate F-induced injury by inhibiting the immune response and apoptosis in the testis. These data suggest that targeting IL-17A may be a useful therapeutic strategy for treating F-mediated toxicity in the testis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",apoptosis; cytokines; fluorosis; il-17a; leydig cells; testis; cell death; immune system; mammals; morphology; toxicity; expression levels; immune response; inflammatory response; protein level; reproductive toxicities; semen qualities; signaling pathways; therapeutic strategy; sodium fluoride; caspase 3; caspase 9; ccaat enhancer binding protein alpha; cholesterol monooxygenase (side chain cleaving); fluoride; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 17; interleukin 17 receptor; interleukin 17f; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 21; interleukin 23; interleukin 6; messenger rna; testosterone; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; fluoride; interleukin 17; apoptosis; biochemistry; epidemiology; fluoride; immune response; injury; organic compound; protein; signaling; sodium; testosterone; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; controlled study; cytokine release; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorosis; gene expression; histopathology; immune response; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; inflammation; leydig cell; mouse; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; sperm quality; spermatozoon count; testis injury; testosterone blood level; testosterone release; ultrastructure; animal; apoptosis; genetics; human; immunity; male; semen analysis; mus; animals; apoptosis; fluorides; humans; immunity; interleukin-17; male; mice; semen analysis,No
Whole-genome sequencing of wild Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) provides insights into its genetic features,"Yi L, Dalai M, Su R, Lin W, Erdenedalai M, Luvsantseren B, Chimedtseren C, Wang Z, Hasi S",2020,Article,10.1186/s12864-020-6495-2,"Background: Siberian musk deer, one of the seven species, is distributed in coniferous forests of Asia. Worldwide, the population size of Siberian musk deer is threatened by severe illegal poaching for commercially valuable musk and meat, habitat losses, and forest fire. At present, this species is categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. However, the genetic information of Siberian musk deer is largely unexplored. Results: Here, we produced 3.10 Gb draft assembly of wild Siberian musk deer with a contig N50 of 29,145 bp and a scaffold N50 of 7,955,248 bp. We annotated 19,363 protein-coding genes and estimated 44.44% of the genome to be repetitive. Our phylogenetic analysis reveals that wild Siberian musk deer is closer to Bovidae than to Cervidae. Comparative analyses showed that the genetic features of Siberian musk deer adapted in cold and high-altitude environments. We sequenced two additional genomes of Siberian musk deer constructed demographic history indicated that changes in effective population size corresponded with recent glacial epochs. Finally, we identified several candidate genes that may play a role in the musk secretion based on transcriptome analysis.

Host-Specific Serum Factors Control the Development and Survival of Schistosoma mansoni,"Anisuzzaman, Frahm S, Prodjinotho UF, Bhattacharjee S, Verschoor A, Prazeres da Costa C",2021,Article,10.3389/fimmu.2021.635622,"Introduction: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by blood-dwelling flatworms which develop from skin-penetrating cercariae, the freely swimming water-borne infective stage of Schistosoma mansoni, into adult worms. This natural course of infection can be mimicked in experimental mouse models of schistosomiasis. However, only a maximum of 20-30% of penetrated cercariae mature into fecund adults. The reasons for this are unknown but could potentially involve soluble factors of the innate immune system, such as complement factors and preexisting, natural antibodies. Materials and Methods: Using our recently developed novel serum- and cell-free in vitro culture system for newly transformed schistosomula (NTS), which supports long-term larval survival, we investigated the effects of mouse serum and its major soluble complement factors C1q, C3, C4 as well as preexisting, natural IgM in vitro and assessed worm development in vivo by infecting complement and soluble (s)IgM-deficient animals. Results: In contrast to sera from humans and a broad variety of mammalian species, serum from mice, surprisingly, killed parasites already at skin stage in vitro. Interestingly, the most efficient killing component(s) were heat-labile but did not include important members of the perhaps best known family of heat-labile serum factors, the complement system, nor consisted of complement-activating natural immunoglobulins. Infection of complement C1q and sIgM-deficient mice with S. mansoni as well as in vitro tests with sera from mice deficient in C3 and C4 revealed no major role for these soluble factors in vivo in regard to parasite maturation, fecundity and associated immunopathology. Rather, the reduction of parasite maturation from cercariae to adult worms was comparable to wild-type mice. Conclusion: This study reveals that not yet identified heat-labile serum factors are major selective determinants of the host-specificity of schistosomiasis, by directly controlling schistosomal development and survival. © Copyright © 2021 Anisuzzaman, Frahm, Prodjinotho, Bhattacharjee, Verschoor and Prazeres da Costa.",antibodies; complement system; host serum; host specificity; newly transformed schistosomula; schistomicidal activity; schistosoma mansoni; complement factor; immunoglobulin m; adaptive immunity; article; bacterial virulence; burkholderia pseudomallei; cell culture; cell viability; cellular immunity; cercaria; complement activation; complement system; cytokine production; fertility; host range; immunopathology; in vivo study; innate immunity; listeria monocytogenes; nonhuman; parasite; protein blood level; schistosoma mansoni; schistosomiasis; schistosomulum; scoring system; tropical disease; visceral leishmaniasis,No
The intestinal microbiota influences Campylobacter jejuni colonization and extraintestinal dissemination in mice,"O'Loughlin JL, Samuelson DR, Braundmeier-Fleming AG, White BA, Haldorson GJ, Stone JB, Lessmann JJ, Eucker TP, Konkel ME",2015,Article,10.1128/AEM.00281-15,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of human foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide. The interactions between this pathogen and the intestinal microbiome within a host are of interest as endogenous intestinal microbiota mediates a form of resistance to the pathogen. This resistance, termed colonization resistance, is the ability of commensal microbiota to prevent colonization by exogenous pathogens or opportunistic commensals. Although mice normally demonstrate colonization resistance to C. jejuni, we found that mice treated with ampicillin are colonized by C. jejuni, with recovery of Campylobacter from the colon, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in recovery of C. jejuni from ampicillin-treated mice inoculated with a C. jejuni virulence mutant (ΔflgL strain) compared to recovery of mice inoculated with the C. jejuni wildtype strain or the C. jejuni complemented isolate (ΔflgL/flgL). Comparative analysis of the microbiota from nontreated and ampicillin- treated CBA/J mice led to the identification of a lactic acid-fermenting isolate of Enterococcus faecalis that prevented C. jejuni growth in vitro and limited C. jejuni colonization of mice. Next-generation sequencing of DNA from fecal pellets that were collected from ampicillin-treated CBA/J mice revealed a significant decrease in diversity of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compared to that in control (nontreated) mice. Taken together, we have demonstrated that treatment of mice with ampicillin alters the intestinal microbiota and permits C. jejuni colonization.

Inactivation of the Caenorhabditis elegans RNF-5 E3 ligase promotes IRE-1-independent ER functions,"Adir O, Bening-Abu-Shach U, Arbib S, Henis-Korenblit S, Broday L",2021,Article,10.1080/15548627.2020.1827778,"RNF5 is implicated in ERAD and in negative regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy. To better understand the function of RNF-5 under ER-stress conditions, we studied the ability of Caenorhabditis elegans rnf-5(tm794) mutant animals to cope with stress in the background of impaired UPR machinery. We demonstrate that downregulation of RNF-5 decreased sensitivity to tunicamycin both in wild type and in an ire-1 mutant. Double-mutant rnf-5;ire-1 animals showed increased starvation resistance and extended lifespan when compared to the ire-1 mutant. This partial rescue of ire-1 required functional autophagy. Downregulation of RNF-5 rescued ER maturation defects and protein secretion of a DAF-28::GFP intestinal reporter in the ire-1 background. Proteomics and functional studies revealed an increase in lysosomal protease levels, in the frequency of intestinal lysosomes, and in lysosomal protease activity in rnf-5(tm794) animals. Together, these data suggest that RNF-5 is a negative regulator of ER stress, and that inactivation of RNF-5 promotes IRE-1-independent elevation of ER capacity. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","autophagy, c. elegans; endoplasmic reticulum; ire1; lysosome; rma1; rnf5; ",No
Gut microbial diversity and stabilizing functions enhance the plateau adaptability of Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang),"Gao H, Chi X, Li G, Qin W, Song P, Jiang F, Liu D, Zhang J, Zhou X, Li S, Zhang T",2020,Article,10.1002/mbo3.1025,"Interactions between gut microbiota not only regulate physical health, but also form a vital bridge between the environment and the host, thus helping the host to better adapt to the environment. The improvement of modern molecular sequencing techniques enables in-depth investigations of the gut microbiota of vertebrate herbivores without harming them. By sequencing the 16S rRNA V4-V5 region of the gut microbiota of both the captive and wild kiang in winter and summer, the diversity and function of the microbiota could be compared. The reasons for observed differences were discussed. The results showed that the dominant phyla of the kiang were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the structure and abundance of the gut microbiota differed significantly between seasons and environments. However, the relatively stable function of the gut microbiota supplies the host with increased adaptability to the environment. The diversity of the intestinal flora of the kiang is relatively low in captivity, which increases their risk to catch diseases to some extent. Therefore, importance should be attached to the impact of captivity on wildlife. © 2020 The Authors.

Induction of bacterial antigen-specific colitis by a simplified human microbiota consortium in gnotobiotic interleukin-10-/- mice,"Eun CS, Mishima Y, Wohlgemuth S, Liu B, Bower M, Carroll IM, Sartor RB",2014,Article,10.1128/IAI.01513-13,"We evaluated whether a simplified human microbiota consortium (SIHUMI) induces colitis in germfree (GF) 129S6/SvEv (129) and C57BL/6 (B6) interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice, determined mouse strain effects on colitis and the microbiota, examined the effects of inflammation on relative bacterial composition, and identified immunodominant bacterial species in ""humanized"" IL-10-/- mice. GF wild-type (WT) and IL-10-/- 129 and B6 mice were colonized with 7 human-derived inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related intestinal bacteria and maintained under gnotobiotic conditions. Quantification of bacteria in feces, ileal and colonic contents, and tissues was performed using 16S rRNA gene selective quantitative PCR. Colonic segments were scored histologically, and gamma interferon (IFN-γ), IL-12p40, and IL-17 levels were measured in supernatants of unstimulated colonic tissue explants and of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells stimulated by lysates of individual or aggregate bacterial strains. Relative bacterial species abundances changed over time and differed between 129 and B6 mice, WT and IL-10-/- mice, luminal and mucosal samples, and ileal and colonic or fecal samples. SIHUMI induced colitis in all IL-10-/- mice, with more aggressive colitis and MLN cell activation in 129 mice. Escherichia coli LF82 and Ruminococcus gnavus lysates induced dominant effector ex vivo MLN TH1 and TH17 responses, although the bacterial mucosal concentrations were low. In summary, this study shows that a simplified human bacterial consortium induces colitis in ex-GF 129 and B6 IL-10-/- mice. Relative concentrations of individual SIHUMI species are determined by host genotype, the presence of inflammation, and anatomical location. A subset of IBD-relevant human enteric bacterial species preferentially stimulates bacterial antigen-specific TH1 and TH17 immune responses in this model, independent of luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.","; bacterial antigen; bacterial dna; bacterium lysate; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 17; rna 16s; cytokine; interleukin 10; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antigen specificity; article; bacterial colonization; bacterial strain; bacterium identification; cell activation; cell lysate; cell stimulation; cellular immunity; cellular immunodeficiency; colon; colon flora; colon mucosa; controlled study; escherichia coli; ex vivo study; experimental colitis; explant; feces microflora; germfree animal; gnotobiotics; histopathology; ileum; intestine flora; lymph node cell; mesentery lymph node; microbial consortium; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; priority journal; ruminococcus; ruminococcus gnavus; small intestine mucosa; species composition; species dominance; supernatant; th1 cell; th17 cell; wild type; animal; bacterial count; c57bl mouse; cell culture; colitis; deficiency; enterobacteriaceae; enterobacteriaceae infection; feces; growth, development and aging; human; immunology; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; stomach mucosa; animals; cells, cultured; colitis; colon; colony count, microbial; cytokines; enterobacteriaceae; enterobacteriaceae infections; feces; gastric mucosa; germ-free life; humans; ileum; interleukin-10; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; microbiota; th1 cells; th17 cells",No
Linking rhizosphere microbiome composition of wild and domesticated Phaseolus vulgaris to genotypic and root phenotypic traits,"Pérez-Jaramillo JE, Carrión VJ, Bosse M, Ferrão LFV, De Hollander M, Garcia AAF, Ramírez CA, Mendes R, Raaijmakers JM",2017,Article,10.1038/ismej.2017.85,"Plant domestication was a pivotal accomplishment in human history, but also led to a reduction in genetic diversity of crop species compared to their wild ancestors. How this reduced genetic diversity affected plant-microbe interactions belowground is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the genetic relatedness, root phenotypic traits and rhizobacterial community composition of modern and wild accessions of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) grown in agricultural soil from the highlands of Colombia, one of the centers of common bean diversification. Diversity Array Technology-based genotyping and phenotyping of local common bean accessions showed significant genetic and root architectural differences between wild and modern accessions, with a higher specific root length for the wild accessions. Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that the divergence in rhizobacterial community composition between wild and modern bean accessions is associated with differences in specific root length. Along the bean genotypic trajectory, going from wild to modern, we observed a gradual decrease in relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, mainly Chitinophagaceae and Cytophagaceae, and an increase in relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, in particular Nocardioidaceae and Rhizobiaceae, respectively.

Lithocholic acid increases intestinal phosphate and calcium absorption in a vitamin D receptor dependent but transcellular pathway independent manner,"Hashimoto N, Matsui I, Ishizuka S, Inoue K, Matsumoto A, Shimada K, Hori S, Lee DG, Yasuda S, Katsuma Y, Kajimoto S, Doi Y, Yamaguchi S, Kubota K, Oka T, Sakaguchi Y, Takabatake Y, Hamano T, Isaka Y",2020,Article,10.1016/j.kint.2020.01.032,"Phosphate/calcium homeostasis is crucial for health maintenance. Lithocholic acid, a bile acid produced by intestinal bacteria, is an agonist of vitamin D receptor. However, its effects on phosphate/calcium homeostasis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that lithocholic acid increases intestinal phosphate/calcium absorption in an enterocyte vitamin D receptor-dependent manner. Lithocholic acid was found to increase serum phosphate/calcium levels and thus to exacerbate vascular calcification in animals with chronic kidney disease. Lithocholic acid did not affect levels of intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2b, Pi transporter-1, -2, or transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6. Everted gut sac analyses demonstrated that lithocholic acid increased phosphate/calcium absorption in a transcellular pathway-independent manner. Lithocholic acid suppressed intestinal mucosal claudin 3 and occludin in wild-type mice, but not in vitamin D receptor knockout mice. Everted gut sacs of claudin 3 knockout mice showed an increased permeability for phosphate, but not calcium. In patients with chronic kidney disease, serum 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D levels are decreased, probably as an intrinsic adjustment to reduce phosphate/calcium burden. In contrast, serum and fecal lithocholic acid levels and fecal levels of bile acid 7α-dehydratase, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in lithocholic acid production, were not downregulated. The effects of lithocholic acid were eliminated by bile acid adsorptive resin in mice.

Role of metAB in methionine metabolism and optimal chicken colonization in campylobacter jejuni,"Ruddell B, Hassall A, Sahin O, Zhang Q, Plummer PJ, Kreuder AJ",2021,Article,10.1128/IAI.00542-20,"Campylobacter jejuni is a zoonotic pathogen and is one of the leading causes of human gastroenteritis worldwide. C. jejuni IA3902 (representative of the sheep abortion clone) is genetically similar to C. jejuni W7 (representative of strain type NCTC 11168); however, there are significant differences in the ability of luxS mutants of these strains to colonize chickens. LuxS is essential for the activated methyl cycle and generates homocysteine for conversion to L-methionine. Comparative genomics identified differential distribution of the genes metA and metB, which function to convert homoserine for downstream production of L-methionine, between IA3902 and W7, which could enable a secondary pathway for L-methionine biosynthesis in a W7 ΔluxS but not in an IA3902 ΔluxS strain. To test the hypothesis that the genes metA and metB contribute to L-methionine production and chicken colonization by Campylobacter, we constructed two mutants for phenotypic comparison, the W7 ΔmetAB ΔluxS and IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB mutants. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and tandem mass spectrometry protein analysis were used to validate MetAB transcription and translation as present in the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB mutant and absent in the W7 ΔmetAB ΔluxS mutant. Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer fluorescence assays demonstrated that L-methionine and S-adenosyl methionine concentrations decreased in the W7 ΔmetAB ΔluxS mutant and increased in the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB mutant. Assessment of chicken colonization revealed that the IA3902 ΔluxS::metAB strain partially rescued the colonization defect of the IA3902 ΔluxS strain, while the W7 ΔmetAB ΔluxS strain showed significantly decreased colonization compared to that of the wild-type and the W7 ΔluxS strain. These results indicate that the ability to maintain L-methionine production in vivo, conferred by metA and metB in the absence of luxS, is critical for normal chicken colonization by C. jejuni. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

Changes in the community structure of the symbiotic microbes of wild amphibians from the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau,"Xu LL, Chen H, Zhang M, Zhu W, Chang Q, Lu G, Chen Y, Jiang J, Zhu L",2020,Article,10.1002/mbo3.1004,"Environment has a potential effect on the animal symbiotic microbiome. Here, to study the potential relationship of the symbiotic microbiomes of wild amphibians with altitude, we collected the gut and skin samples from frogs (nine species) and the environmental samples (water and soil samples) from the Leshan Mountains (altitude: 360–410 m) and Gongga Mountains (altitude: 3340–3989 m) on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Bufo gargarizans (Bg) samples were collected from both the Leshan and Gongga mountain regions (Bg was the only species sampled on both mountains). The DNA extracted from each sample was performed high-throughput sequencing (MiSeq) of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. High relative abundance of Caulobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae was found in skin samples from both Bg and the other high-altitude amphibians (nine species combined). High relative abundance of Coxiellaceae and Mycoplasmataceae was found in gut samples from both Bg and the other high-altitude amphibians. Furthermore, the alpha and beta diversities of skin and gut samples from Bg and the other amphibian species (nine species combined) were similar. In terms of the symbiotic microbial community, the low-altitude samples were less diverse and more similar to each other than the high-altitude samples were. We speculated that extreme high-altitude environments and host phylogeny may affect the amphibian microbiome. Despite the distinct microbial community differences between the skin and gut microbiomes, some functions were similar in the Bg and combined high-altitude samples. The Bg and high-altitude skin samples had higher oxidative stress tolerance and biofilm formation than the low-altitude skin samples. However, the opposite results were observed for the Bg and high-altitude gut samples. Further study is required to determine whether these characteristics favor high-altitude amphibian adaptation to extreme environments. © 2020 The Authors.

Polar bear-adapted Ursidibacter maritimus are remarkably conserved after generations in captivity,"Espinosa-Gongora C, Hansen MJ, Bertelsen MF, Bojesen AM",2021,Article,10.1111/mec.16075,"Most species in the bacterial family of Pasteurellaceae colonize one specific host species. Vertebrates of very different evolutionary descent including fish, turtles, marsupials, eutherians and birds are colonized by different members of Pasteurellaceae. This one-to-one microbial-host species partnership makes Pasteurellaceae species valuable candidates to study biodiversity, bacterial-host co-evolution and host adaptation, and their widespread distribution across vertebrates provide the possibility to collect a wide array of data, where wildlife species are essential. However, obtaining samples from wild animals comes with logistic, technical and ethical challenges, and previous microbiota studies have led to the presumption that captive animals are poor models for microbial studies in wildlife. Here, we show that colonization of polar bears by Ursidibacter maritimus is unaffected by factors related to captivity, reflecting a deep symbiotic bond to the host. We argue that the study of ecological and evolutionary principles in captive wildlife is possible for host-adapted taxa such as those in the Pasteurellaceae family.

"Wide genetic diversity of blastocystis in white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from Maryland, USA","Maloney JG, Jang Y, Molokin A, George NS, Santin M",2021,Article,10.3390/microorganisms9061343,"Blastocystis is a gastrointestinal protist frequently reported in humans and animals worldwide. Wildlife populations, including deer, may serve as reservoirs of parasitic diseases for both humans and domestic animals, either through direct contact or through contamination of food or water resources. However, no studies of the occurrence and subtype distribution of Blastocystis in wildlife populations have been conducted in the United States. PCR and next generation amplicon sequencing were used to determine the occurrence and subtypes of Blastocystis in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Blastocystis was common, with 88.8% (71/80) of samples found to be positive. Twelve subtypes were identified, ten previously reported (ST1, ST3, ST4, ST10, ST14, ST21, and ST23–ST26) and two novel subtypes (ST30 and ST31). To confirm the validity of ST30 and ST31, MinION sequencing was used to obtain full‐length SSU rRNA gene sequences, and phylogenetic and pairwise distance analyses were performed. ST10, ST14, and ST24 were the most commonly observed subtypes. Potentially zoonotic subtypes ST1, ST3, or ST4 were present in 8.5% of Blastocystis‐positives. Mixed subtype infections were common (90.1% of Blastocystis‐positives). This study is the first to subtype Blastocystis in white‐tailed deer. White‐tailed deer were found to be commonly infected/colonized with a wide diversity of subtypes, including two novel subtypes, zoonotic subtypes, and subtypes frequently reported in domestic animals.

Genotype and phenotypes of an intestine-adapted Escherichia coli K-12 mutant selected by animal passage for superior colonization,"Fabich AJ, Leatham MP, Grissom JE, Wiley G, Lai H, Najar F, Roe BA, Cohen PS, Conway T",2011,Article,10.1128/IAI.01199-10,"We previously isolated a spontaneous mutant of Escherichia coli K-12, strain MG1655, following passage through the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine, that has colonization traits superior to the wild-type parent strain (M. P. Leatham et al., Infect. Immun. 73:8039-8049, 2005). This intestine-adapted strain (E. coli MG1655*) grew faster on several different carbon sources than the wild type and was nonmotile due to deletion of the flhD gene. We now report the results of several high-throughput genomic analysis approaches to further characterize E. coli MG1655*. Whole-genome pyrosequencing did not reveal any changes on its genome, aside from the deletion at the flhDC locus, that could explain the colonization advantage of E. coli MG1655*. Microarray analysis revealed modest yet significant induction of catabolic gene systems across the genome in both E. coli MG1655* and an isogenic flhD mutant constructed in the laboratory. Catabolome analysis with Biolog GN2 microplates revealed an enhanced ability of both E. coli MG1655* and the isogenic flhD mutant to oxidize a variety of carbon sources. The results show that intestine-adapted E. coli MG1655* is more fit than the wild type for intestinal colonization, because loss of FlhD results in elevated expression of genes involved in carbon and energy metabolism, resulting in more efficient carbon source utilization and a higher intestinal population. Hence, mutations that enhance metabolic efficiency confer a colonization advantage. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.","; animal experiment; article; bacterial colonization; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; escherichia coli; flhd gene; gene expression; gene mutation; gene sequence; genotype; intestine; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; animals; base sequence; escherichia coli k12; genes, bacterial; genome; genome-wide association study; genotype; intestines; male; mice; molecular sequence data; oligonucleotide array sequence analysis; phenotype; sequence analysis",No
The Microbiome of the Uropygial Secretion in Hoopoes Is Shaped Along the Nesting Phase,"Martínez-García Á, Martín-Vivaldi M, Ruiz-Rodríguez M, Martínez-Bueno M, Arco L, Rodríguez-Ruano SM, Peralta-Sánchez JM, Soler JJ",2016,Article,10.1007/s00248-016-0765-1,"Microbial symbiont acquisition by hosts may determine the effectiveness of the mutualistic relationships. A mix of vertical and horizontal transmission may be advantageous for hosts by allowing plastic changes of microbial communities depending on environmental conditions. Plasticity is well known for gut microbiota but is poorly understood for other symbionts of wild animals. We here explore the importance of environmental conditions experienced by nestling hoopoes (Upupa epops) during the late nesting phase determining microbiota in their uropygial gland. In cross-fostering experiments of 8 days old nestlings, “sibling-sibling” and “mother-offspring” comparisons were used to explore whether the bacterial community naturally established in the uropygial gland of nestlings could change depending on experimental environmental conditions (i.e., new nest environment). We found that the final microbiome of nestlings was mainly explained by nest of origin. Moreover, cross-fostered nestlings were more similar to their siblings and mothers than to their stepsiblings and stepmothers. We also detected a significant effect of nest of rearing, suggesting that nestling hoopoes acquire most bacterial symbionts during the first days of life but that the microbiome is dynamic and can be modified along the nestling period depending on environmental conditions. Estimated effects of nest of rearing, but also most of those of nest of origin are associated to environmental characteristics of nests, which are extended phenotypes of parents. Thus, natural selection may favor the acquisition of appropriated microbial symbionts for particular environmental conditions found in nests. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","cross-fostering experiment; horizontal transmission; microbial symbiont; microbial transmission; parent-offspring comparisons; plasticity; upupa epops; vertical transmission; bacterial dna; animal; bacterium; bird; classification; exocrine gland; female; genetics; genomics; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; microflora; nesting; physiology; symbiosis; animals; bacteria; birds; dna, bacterial; exocrine glands; female; genomics; male; microbiota; nesting behavior; symbiosis",No
Microorganism's adaptation of Crucian carp may closely relate to its living environments,"Zhang H, Tang H, Zang Y, Tang X, Wang Y",2019,Article,10.1002/mbo3.650,"The relationship between the internal microbiome of an individual organism and that of its external environment has been little investigated in freshwater ecosystems. Thus, this is an area of interest in freshwater fish biology. Along with the genotype of the fish host, external environment plays an important role in determining the composition of the internal microbiome. Here, we characterized the variability of the microbiome of wild Crucian carp (Carassius auratus), along with those of their surrounding environments (water and mud). We found that each environment had distinct bacterial communities, with varying composition and structure. The primary bacterial phyla identified in the Crucian carp gut were Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria (90% of all bacterial phyla identified); the primary genera identified were Cetobacterium, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas (85% of all bacterial phyla identified). We identified 1,739 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the Crucian carp gut, 1,703 in water, and 5,322 in mud. Each environment had unique OTUs, but the fewest unique OTUs (97) were found in the Crucian carp gut. There were significant differences in the relative abundances of different bacterial phyla in the different environments.

Loss of CD14 leads to disturbed epithelial-B cell crosstalk and impairment of the intestinal barrier after E. coli Nissle monoassociation,"Basic M, Buettner M, Keubler LM, Smoczek A, Bruesch I, Buchheister S, Bleich A",2018,Article,10.1038/s41598-017-19062-7,"The TLR4 co-receptor CD14 was identified as an IBD candidate gene. Here, its influence on the intestinal barrier was addressed utilizing E. coli Nissle (EcN), which induces severe inflammation in germfree TLR4-/- mice. After monoassociation, EcN was detected in spleens and livers of TLR4-/- and CD14-/- but not wildtype mice. Barrier impairment was characterized by increased apoptosis and decreased epithelial junction (EJ) expression and was reversed by TLR2 stimulation in CD14-/- mice. Bone marrow (BM) transplantation revealed contribution of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells towards intestinal homeostasis. EcN inoculated WT mice showed B cell activation, CD14-/- and TLR4-/- mice cytotoxic T cell and impaired B cell responses. The latter was characterized by absence of B cells in TLR4-/- mice, decreased levels of EcN induced immunoglobulins and downregulation of their transporter pIgR. EcN colonization of mice with genetically or antibody induced impaired B cell response resulted in dissemination of EcN and downregulation of EJ. BM chimeras indicated that CD14 originating from radiation resistant cells is sufficient to restore EJ-function. Overall, CD14/TLR4 signalling seems to be critical for intestinal barrier function and for the crosstalk between B cells and the epithelium, underlining that CD14 serves as a protective modulator of intestinal homeostasis. © 2018 The Author(s).","; lipopolysaccharide receptor; tlr4 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 4; animal; b lymphocyte; bacterium adherence; cell communication; deficiency; epithelium cell; escherichia coli; host pathogen interaction; knockout mouse; metabolism; mouse; physiology; animals; b-lymphocytes; bacterial adhesion; cell communication; epithelial cells; escherichia coli; host-pathogen interactions; lipopolysaccharide receptors; mice; mice, knockout; toll-like receptor 4",No
Bile Diversion Improves Metabolic Phenotype Dependent on Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR),"Pierre JF, Li Y, Gomes CK, Rao P, Chang EB, Yin DP",2019,Article,10.1002/oby.22440,"Objective: The current study investigated whether bile diversion (BD) improves metabolic phenotype under farnesoid X receptor (FXR) deficiency. Methods: BD was performed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed FXR knockout (FXRko) and wild-type (WT) animals. Metabolic phenotypes, circulating enteroendocrine hormones, total bile acids (BAs) and BA composition, and cecal gut microbiota were analyzed. Results: FXR-deficient mice were resistant to HFD-induced obesity; however, FXR-deficient mice also developed hyperglycemia and exhibited increased liver weight, liver steatosis, and circulating triglycerides. BD increased circulating total BAs and taurine-b-muricholic acid, which were in line with normalized hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance in HFD-fed WT mice. FXR deficiency also increased total BAs and taurine-b-muricholic acid, but these animals remained hyperglycemic. While BD improved metabolic phenotype in HFD-fed FXRko mice, these improvements were not as effective as in WT mice. BD increased liver expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1β and elevated circulating glucagon-like peptide-1 levels in WT mice but not in FXRko mice. FXR deficiency altered gut microbiota composition with a specific increase in phylum Proteobacteria that may act as a possible microbial signature of some diseases.

Faecal microbiota dynamics in Cornu aspersum during dietary change and antibiotic challenge,"Smith PN, Boomer SM, Baltzley MJ",2019,Article,10.1093/mollus/eyz016,"Despite its widespread geographic distribution and applications, the herbivorous land snail Cornu aspersum represents an understudied animal host. In this study, we used a culture-based approach, in combination with a population analysis based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, to describe changes in the faecal microbiota of wild-caught snails that were fed a nonsterile plant diet over a period of 21 days. At the beginning of the experiment, wild-caught snails harboured diverse populations of Gammaproteobacteria. The two most abundant genera of Gammaproteobacteria were soil-associated Pseudomonas and Buttiauxella; the latter is an understudied genus often reported in snails and slugs. During penicillin treatment, the diversity of Gammaproteobacteria in experimental snails bottlenecked, resulting in Pseudomonas takeover. Following penicillin treatment, experimental snails began to recover, with faecal samples containing pre-treatment Gammaproteobacteria groups by day 21. There was a significant difference in the colony-forming units/g across days and across treatments. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between day and treatment. The food source was not sterile and supported its own population of Gammaproteobacteria, primarily Pseudomonas, which would have been taken up by the snails daily. Given that Buttiauxella was not observed on the food source, we hypothesize that it was present and maintained within the digestive tract of C. aspersum, and this is consistent with the idea that C. aspersum maintains an endogenous gut microbiome. © The Author(s) 2019.",; antibiotics; geographical distribution; microorganism; rna; snail; soil fauna; species diversity; wild population; animalia; buttiauxella; gammaproteobacteria; gastropoda; pseudomonas; stylommatophora,No
Assessment of the role of FGF15 in mediating the metabolic outcomes of murine vertical sleeve gastrectomy,"Myronovych A, Bhattacharjee J, Salazar-Gonzalez R-M, Tan B, Mowery S, Ferguson D, Ryan KK, Zhang W, Zhao X, Oehrle M, Setchell KDR, Seeley RJ, Sandoval DA, Kohli R",2020,Article,10.1152/AJPGI.00175.2020,"Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is the best current therapy for remission of obesity and its comorbidities. It is understood to alter the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in vivo. Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in humans and its murine ortholog Fgf15 play a pivotal role in this bile acid-driven enterohepatic signaling. The present study evaluated the metabolic outcomes of VSG in Fgf15-deficient (KO) mice. 6- to 8-wk-old male wild-type (WT) and KO mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk. At 8th week of diet, both WT and KO mice were randomly distributed to VSG or sham surgery. Postsurgery, mice were observed for 8 wk while fed a HFD and then euthanized to collect tissues for experimental analysis. KO mice lost weight post-VSG, but glucose tolerance in KO mice did not improve post-VSG compared with WT mice. Enteroids derived from WT and KO mice proliferated with bile acid exposure in vitro. Post-VSG, both WT and KO mice had similarly altered bile acid enterohepatic flux; however, Fgf15 deficient mice post-VSG had increased hepatic accumulation of free and esterified cholesterol, leading to lipotoxicity-related endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammasome activation, and increased Fgf21 expression. We conclude that intact Fgf15-mediated enterohepatic bile acid signaling, but not changes in bile acid flux, appear to be important for the metabolic improvements post-murine bariatric surgery. These novel data introduce a potential point of distinction between bile acids acting as ligands compared with their canonical downstream signaling pathways. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the absence of an intact fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signaling pathway, murine vertical sleeve gastrectomy results in weight loss without all its anticipated metabolic benefits. In the absence of an intact FGF15 signaling pathway, vertical sleeve gastrectomy results in increased intestinal bile acid levels and hepatolipotoxicity. © 2020 American Physiological Society.

"Gut bacterial and fungal communities of the wild and laboratory-reared Thitarodes larvae, host of the chinese medicinal fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis on tibetan plateau","Liu G, Zheng X, Long H, Rao Z, Cao L, Han R",2021,Article,10.3390/insects12040327,"By employing a culture-dependent and -independent 16S rRNA and ITS gene highthroughput sequencing analyses, comprehensive information was obtained on the gut bacterial and fungal communities in the ghost moth larvae of three different geographic locations from highaltitude on Tibet plateau and from low-altitude laboratory. Twenty-six culturable bacterial species belonging to 21 genera and 14 fungal species belonging to 12 genera were identified from six populations by culture-dependent method. Carnobacterium maltaromaticum was the most abundant bacterial species from both the wild and laboratory-reared larvae. The most abundant OTUs in the wild ghost moth populations were Carnobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae for bacteria, and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota for fungi. Larval microbial communities of the wild ghost moth from different geographic locations were not significantly different from each other but significant difference in larval microbial community was detected between the wild and laboratory-reared ghost moth. The larval gut of the wild ghost moth was dominated by the culturable Carnobacterium. However, that of the laboratory-reared ghost moth exhibited significantly abundant Wolbachia, Rhizobium, Serratia, Pseudomonas, and Flavobacterium. Furthermore, the larval gut of the wild ghost moth had a significantly higher abundance of Ophiocordyceps but lower abundance of Candida and Aspergillus than that of the laboratory-reared ghost moth. © 2021 by the authors.",artificial rearing; ghost moth; high-altitude; microbiota; ophiocordyceps sinensis; thitarodes; ,Yes
Hunting bamboo: FORAGING patch selection and utilization by giant pandas and implications for conservation,"Wei W, Nie Y, Zhang Z, Hu Y, Yan L, Qi D, Li X, Wei F",2015,Article,10.1016/j.biocon.2015.03.023,"Food resources are patchily distributed in the environment and carnivores and herbivores have adopted different foraging strategies to maximize feeding efficiency. One interesting strategy is that of the giant panda, a member of the Carnivora that has evolved into a bamboo specialist. Giant pandas forage discriminately, but it remains unknown how nutritional hierarchical levels and landscape configuration heterogeneity affect foraging patch selection. Here, we used global positioning system collars to track wild giant pandas at high resolution (<10. m) and sampled foraging patches for nutritional hierarchical level analysis. We predicted that giant pandas select foraging patches with microhabitat characteristics that decrease energy expenditure during foraging according to optimal search theory. We introduce the concept of nutrient load as the product of local patch nutrient concentration and predicted that relatively efficient nutrients in fluctuating nutritional environments may determine foraging patch selection in giant pandas. This is the first time that microhabitat characteristics, key nutrients and foraging behavior have been studied in combination in giant pandas. We used random forest (RF) and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to infer habitat and nutritional factors that may influence foraging patch selection and utilization. Our results reveal that giant pandas select foraging patches with a topography that likely decreases energy expenditure. Giant pandas also favor protein-rich foraging patches, probably because protein can be digested and assimilated faster than cellulose and this maximizes net energy gains. These data provide a new perspective on foraging patch selection strategies in heterogeneous habitats of diet-specialized species under constant nutritional challenge. Improved conservation planning can be undertaken according to our findings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",ailuropoda melanoleuca; conservation implication; foraging patch utilization; foraging strategy; landscape configuration heterogeneity; nutritional hierarchical level; bamboo; carnivore; conservation planning; foraging behavior; gps; habitat selection; mammal; microhabitat; nutrient enrichment; specialist; species conservation; ailuropoda melanoleuca; carnivora,No
Gene encoding the CTP synthetase as an appropriate molecular tool for identification and phylogenetic study of the family Bifidobacteriaceae,"Killer J, Mekadim C, Pechar R, Bunešová V, Mrázek J, Vlková E",2018,Article,10.1002/mbo3.579,"An alternative molecular marker with respect to the 16S rRNA gene demonstrating better identification and phylogenetic parameters has not been designed for the whole Bifidobacteriaceae family, which includes the genus Bifidobacterium and scardovial genera. Therefore, the aim of the study was to find such a gene in available genomic sequences, suggest appropriate means and conditions for asmplification and sequencing of the desired region of the selected gene in various strains of the bacterial family and verify the importance in classification and phylogeny. Specific primers flanking the variable region (~800 pb) within the pyrG gene encoding the CTP synthetase were designed by means of gene sequences retrieved from the genomes of strains belonging to the family Bifidobacteriaceae. The functionality and specificity of the primers were subsequently tested on the wild (7) and type strains of bifidobacteria (36) and scardovia (7). Comparative and phylogenetic studies based on obtained sequences revealed actual significance in classification and phylogeny of the Bifidobacteriaceae family. Gene statistics (percentages of mean sequence similarities and identical sites, mean number of nucleotide differences, P- and K-distances) and phylogenetic analyses (congruence between tree topologies, percentages of bootstrap values >50 and 70%) indicate that the pyrG gene represents an alternative identification and phylogenetic marker exhibiting higher discriminatory power among strains, (sub)species, and genera than the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences of the particular gene fragment, simply achieved through specific primers, enable more precisely to classify and evaluate phylogeny of the family Bifidobacteriaceae including, with some exceptions, health-promoting probiotic bacteria. © 2018 The Authors.

Experimental validation of small mammal gut microbiota sampling from faeces and from the caecum after death,"Čížková D, Ďureje Ľ, Piálek J, Kreisinger J",2021,Article,10.1038/s41437-021-00445-6,"Data on the gut microbiota (GM) of wild animals are key to studies on evolutionary biology (host–GM interactions under natural selection), ecology and conservation biology (GM as a fitness component closely connected to the environment). Wildlife GM sampling often requires non-invasive techniques or sampling from dead animals. In a controlled experiment profiling microbial 16S rRNA in 52 house mice (Mus musculus) from eight families and four genetic backgrounds, we studied the effects of live- and snap-trapping on small mammal GM and evaluated the suitability of microbiota from non-fresh faeces as a proxy for caecal GM. We compared CM from individuals sampled 16–18 h after death with those in live traps and caged controls, and caecal and faecal GM collected from mice in live-traps. Sampling delay did not affect GM composition, validating data from fresh cadavers or snap-trapped animals. Animals trapped overnight displayed a slight but significant difference in GM composition to the caged controls, though the change only had negligible effect on GM diversity, composition and inter-individual divergence. Hence, the trapping process appears not to bias GM profiling. Despite their significant difference, caecal and faecal microbiota were correlated in composition and, to a lesser extent, diversity. Both showed congruent patterns of inter-individual divergence following the natural structure of the dataset. Thus, the faecal microbiome represents a good non-invasive proxy of the caecal microbiome, making it suitable for detecting biologically relevant patterns. However, care should be taken when analysing mixed datasets containing both faecal and caecal samples. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.",; evolutionary biology; feces; microorganism; model validation; sampling; small mammal; mammalia; microbiota; mus musculus,No
LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing system in edwardsiella piscicida promotes biofilm formation and pathogenicity,"Sun Y, Li Y, Luo Q, Huang J, Chen J, Zhang R, Wang X",2020,Article,10.1128/IAI.00907-19,"LuxS/AI-2 is an important quorum sensing system which affects the growth, biofilm formation, virulence, and metabolism of bacteria. LuxS is encoded by the luxS gene, but how this gene is associated with a diverse array of physiological activities in Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) is not known. Here, we constructed an luxS gene mutant strain, the oluxS strain, to identify how LuxS/AI-2 affects pathogenicity. The results showed that LuxS was not found in the luxS gene mutant strain, and this gene deletion decreased E. piscicida growth compared to that of the wild-type strain. Meanwhile, the wild-type strain significantly increased penetration and motility in mucin compared to levels with the oluxS strain. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the E. piscicida oluxS strain for zebrafish was significantly higher than that of the wild-type strain, which suggested that the luxS gene deletion could attenuate the strain's virulence. The AI-2 activities of EIB202 were 56-fold higher than those in the oluxS strain, suggesting that the luxS gene promotes AI-2 production. Transcriptome results demonstrated that between cells infected with the oluxS strain and those infected with the wild-type strain 46 genes were significantly differentially regulated, which included 34 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes. Among these genes, the largest number were closely related to cell immunity and signaling systems. In addition, the biofilm formation ability of EIB202 was significantly higher than that of the oluxS strain. The supernatant of EIB202 increased the biofilm formation ability of the oluxS strain, which suggested that the luxS gene and its product LuxS enhanced biofilm formation in E. piscicida. All results indicate that the LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing system in E. piscicida promotes its pathogenicity through increasing a diverse array of physiological activities. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

"Processed foods, dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, and poor health",Bengmark S,2013,Article,10.2174/1573401311309020006,"Modern Western food contains less than twenty per cent of the ingredients on which our paleolithic ancestors lived and other primates like the wild chimpanzees live today. Fresh greens, fruits, seeds, piths, bark and insects were the foods to which humans had been adapted during millions of years. A recent study found that 80% of diet of wild chimpanzee consists of ripe and unripe fruits, young leaves, flowers and fresh and dry seeds, and roots/tubers used only in times of draft. In contrast Western food consists of more than fifty per cent refined carbohydrates (cooked, rice heated to very high temperatures, bread, pasta, potato and other tubers) and in another 25-30 per cent animal products and refined oils, leaving less than 20 per cent of their foods similar to those of our ancestors. The situation is even worse in critically ill patient, whose nutrition usually contains no greens at all. It is fully documented that these Western foods, when consumed in larger quantities are detrimental to health: inducing increased systemic inflammation; increased supply of and stimulation of IGF1, stimulation of Toll-like receptors, leading to obesity and an epidemic of chronic diseases, which has increased and continue to increase dramatically. Modern molecular biology techniques have made it possible to explore the mechanisms behind these catastrophic effects of modern living. It is a 50-year-old observation that beneficial bacteria like lactobacilli do not grow well when exposed to food ingredients such casein (dairy) and gluten (wheat, rye and barley). More recent Studies demonstrate that human microbiota and its functions compared to rural minorities, are more than 90 % reduced in Western individuals, and further reduced by exposure to chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. The ultimate consequence of these changes is that body membranes lose their tightness and start leaking; such leakage often documented for all body membranes; effects observed in barriers such as in the gut, airways, skin, oral cavity, vagina, nose, eye cavity, placenta and blood-brain barrier. The consequence of this is leakage over the membranes of various damaging toxins of microbial origin such as endotoxins, but also food-derived proteotoxins such as casein, gluten and zein and toxins producing by heating foods to high temperature (grilling, roasting, baking etc) and production of glycated and lipoxidated molecules (AGEs and ALEs). Furthermore, bacterial debris and whole dead or live bacteria will leak and found in the fat of obese and the plaques of individuals with arteriosclerosis. Recent studies report not only reduced numbers and diversity of bacteria in microbiota of individuals with various diseases, but also totally different microbial species in individuals with obesity and various diseases. Attempts to treat diseases by supplying probiotics have only been partly, and at the best temporarily, successful, when applied without any changes in food habits. Furthermore, probiotics are not compatible with pharmacological and other toxic chemicals. Eco-biological treatments, with plant-derived substances, or phytochemicals, e.g. curcumin and resveratrol, and pre-, pro-and synbiotics offer similar effects as use of drugs referred to asbiologicals, although milder but also without adverse effects. Such treatments should be tried as alternative therapies; mainly, to begin with, for disease prevention but also in early cases of chronic diseases. Dramatic alterations, in direction of a paleolithic-like lifestyle and food habits, appear, as we see it today, the only alternative to control the present escalating global health crisis. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",biological; ecobiologicals; infection; inflammation; lactobacillus; lactobacillus paracasei; lactobacillus plantarum; microbial translocation; microbiome; microbiota; neutrophils; pharmaceuticals; probiotic bacteria; toll-like; casein; curcumin; endotoxin; gluten; high mobility group b1 protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; magnesium; melatonin; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; resveratrol; serotonin; synbiotic agent; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; transforming growth factor beta; tryptophan; tumor necrosis factor alpha; article; bacterial strain; body surface; chronic disease; diet therapy; endotoxemia; exercise; fat content; feeding behavior; food; high temperature; human; immune response; inflammation; injury; intestine flora; microbiome; microflora; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; plant fiber; priority journal; sedentary lifestyle; synthesis; vitamin d deficiency; animalia; bacteria (microorganisms); hexapoda; hordeum; lactobacillus; lactobacillus paracasei; lactobacillus plantarum; pan; primates; secale cereale; solanum tuberosum; triticum aestivum,No
Enterococcus faecalis 6-phosphogluconolactonase is required for both commensal and pathogenic interactions with Manduca sexta,"Holt JF, Kiedrowski MR, Frank KL, Du J, Guan C, Broderick NA, Dunny GM, Handelsman J",2015,Article,10.1128/IAI.02442-14,"Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal and pathogen of humans and insects. In Manduca sexta, E. faecalis is an infrequent member of the commensal gut community, but its translocation to the hemocoel results in a commensal-to-pathogen switch. To investigate E. faecalis factors required for commensalism, we identified E. faecalis genes that are upregulated in the gut of M. sexta using recombinase-based in vivo expression technology (RIVET). The RIVET screen produced 113 clones, from which we identified 50 genes that are more highly expressed in the insect gut than in culture. The most frequently recovered gene was locus OG1RF_11582, which encodes a 6-phosphogluconolactonase that we designated pglA. A pglA deletion mutant was impaired in both pathogenesis and gut persistence in M. sexta and produced enhanced biofilms compared with the wild type in an in vitro polystyrene plate assay. Mutation of four other genes identified by RIVET did not affect persistence in caterpillar guts but led to impaired pathogenesis. This is the first identification of genetic determinants for E. faecalis commensal and pathogenic interactions with M. sexta. Bacterial factors identified in this model system may provide insight into colonization or persistence in other host-associated microbial communities and represent potential targets for interventions to prevent E. faecalis infections. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",; 6 phosphogluconolactonase; lactone derivative; polystyrene; unclassified drug; 6-phosphogluconolactonase; carboxylesterase; article; bacterial gene; bacterium culture; biofilm; clone; commensalism; controlled study; deletion mutant; enterococcus faecalis; gene expression; gene identification; gene locus; gene mutation; gene technology; genetic code; host pathogen interaction; in vitro study; in vivo study; intestine; manduca sexta; microbial community; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pathogenesis; recombinase based in vivo expression technology; upregulation; wild type; animal; enterococcus faecalis; enzymology; gastrointestinal tract; gene deletion; gene expression profiling; genetics; manduca; metabolism; microbiology; animals; carboxylic ester hydrolases; enterococcus faecalis; gastrointestinal tract; gene deletion; gene expression profiling; host-pathogen interactions; manduca,No
PhoQ is an unsaturated fatty acid receptor that fine-tunes Salmonella pathogenic traits,"Carabajal MA, Viarengo G, Yim L, Martínez-Sanguiné A, Mariscotti JF, Chabalgoity JA, Rasia RM, Véscovi EG",2020,Article,10.1126/scisignal.aaz3334,"The Salmonella enterica PhoP/PhoQ two-component signaling system coordinates the spatiotemporal expression of key virulence factors that confer pathogenic traits. Through biochemical and structural analyses, we found that the sensor histidine kinase PhoQ acted as a receptor for long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFAs), which induced a conformational change in the periplasmic domain of the PhoQ protein. This resulted in the repression of PhoQ autokinase activity, leading to inhibition of the expression of PhoP/PhoQ-dependent genes. Recognition of the LCUFA linoleic acid (LA) by PhoQ was not stereospecific because positional and geometrical isomers of LA equally inhibited PhoQ autophosphorylation, which was conserved in multiple S. enterica serovars. Because orally acquired Salmonella encounters conjugated LA (CLA), a product of the metabolic conversion of LA by microbiota, in the human intestine, we tested how short-term oral administration of CLA affected gut colonization and systemic dissemination in a mouse model of Salmonella-induced colitis. Compared to untreated mice, CLA-treated mice showed increased gut colonization by wild-type Salmonella, as well as increased dissemination to the spleen. In contrast, the inability of the phoP strain to disseminate systemically remained unchanged by CLA treatment. Together, our results reveal that, by inhibiting PhoQ, environmental LCUFAs fine-tune the fate of Salmonella during infection. These findings may aid in the design of new anti-Salmonella therapies.

Experimental Evolution on a Wild Mammal Species Results in Modifications of Gut Microbial Communities,"Kohl KD, Sadowska ET, Rudolf AM, Dearing MD, Koteja P",2016,Article,10.3389/fmicb.7016.00634,"Comparative studies have shown that diet, life history, and phylogeny interact to determine microbial community structure across mammalian hosts. However, these studies are often confounded by numerous factors. Selection experiments offer unique opportunities to validate conclusions and test hypotheses generated by comparative studies. We used a replicated, 15-generation selection experiment on bank voles (Myodes glareolus) that have been selected for high swim-induced aerobic metabolism, predatory behavior toward crickets, and the ability to maintain body mass on a high-fiber, herbivorous diet. We predicted that selection on host performance, mimicking adaptive radiation, would result in distinct microbial signatures. We collected foregut and cecum samples from animals that were all fed the same nutrient-rich diet and had not been subjected to any performance tests. We conducted microbial inventories of gut contents by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We found no differences in cecal microbial community structure or diversity between control lines and the aerobic or predatory lines. However, the cecal chambers of voles selected for herbivorous capability harbored distinct microbial communities that exhibited higher diversity than control lines. The foregut communities of herbivorous-selected voles were also distinct from control lines. Overall, this experiment suggests that differences in microbial communities across herbivorous mammals may be evolved, and not solely driven by current diet or other transient factors.",artificial selection; gut microbiome; herbivory; host-microbe interactions; voles; genetic correlations; voluntary exercise; aerobic metabolism; diversity; selection; profiles; bacteria; behavior; rodent; basal,No
Impact of Ileocecal Resection and Concomitant Antibiotics on the Microbiome of the Murine Jejunum and Colon,"Devine AA, Gonzalez A, Speck KE, Knight R, Helmrath M, Lund PK, Azcarate-Peril MA",2013,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0073140,"Ileocecal resection (ICR) is a commonly required surgical intervention in unmanageable Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the impact of ICR, and the concomitant doses of antibiotic routinely given with ICR, on the intestinal commensal microbiota has not been determined. In this study, wild-type C57BL6 mice were subjected to ICR and concomitant single intraperitoneal antibiotic injection. Intestinal lumen contents were collected from jejunum and colon at 7, 14, and 28 days after resection and compared to non-ICR controls. Samples were analyzed by16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. The intestinal microbiota was altered by 7 days after ICR and accompanying antibiotic treatment, with decreased diversity in the colon. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) decreased from 11.8 ± 1.8 in non-ICR controls to 5.9 ± 0.5 in 7-day post-ICR samples. There were also minor effects in the jejunum where PD values decreased from 8.3 ± 0.4 to 7.5 ± 1.4. PCoA analysis indicated that bacterial populations 28 days post-ICR differed significantly from non-ICR controls. Moreover, colon and jejunum bacterial populations were remarkably similar 28 days after resection, whereas the initial communities differed markedly. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla in jejunum and colon before ICR; however, Firmicutes became the vastly predominant phylum in jejunum and colon 28 days after ICR. Although the microbiota returned towards a homeostatic state, with re-establishment of Firmicutes as the predominant phylum, we did not detect Bacteroidetes in the colon 28 days after ICR. In the jejunum Bacteroidetes was detected at a 0.01% abundance after this time period. The changes in jejunal and colonic microbiota induced by ICR and concomitant antibiotic injection may therefore be considered as potential regulators of post-surgical adaptive growth or function, and in a setting of active IBD, potential contributors to post-surgical pathophysiology of disease recurrence. © 2013 Devine et al.","; antibiotic agent; piperacillin plus tazobactam; rna 16s; amplicon; animal cell; animal experiment; antibiotic therapy; article; bacterial load; bacterium; bacteroidetes; colon; controlled study; crohn disease; dna isolation; enterobacteriaceae; erysipelotrichaceae; feces analysis; firmicutes; genetic susceptibility; ileocecal resection; intestine flora; intestine resection; jejunum; lactobacillus; male; microbial community; microbiome; mouse; nonhuman; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; porphyromonas; prevotella; proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; quantitative analysis; ulcerative colitis; animals; anti-bacterial agents; bacteroidetes; colon; crohn disease; humans; jejunum; mice; microbiota; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal, 16s; sequence analysis, rna",No
Assessment of the gorilla gut virome in association with natural simian immunodeficiency virus infection,"D'arc M, Furtado C, Siqueira JD, Seuánez HN, Ayouba A, Peeters M, Soares MA",2018,Article,10.1186/s12977-018-0402-9,"Background: Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) of chimpanzees and gorillas from Central Africa crossed the species barrier at least four times giving rise to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) groups M, N, O and P. The paradigm of non-pathogenic lentiviral infections has been challenged by observations of naturally infected chimpanzees with SIVcpz associated with a negative impact on their life span and reproduction, CD4+ T-lymphocyte loss and lymphoid tissue destruction. With the advent and dissemination of new generation sequencing technologies, novel promising markers of immune deficiency have been explored in human and nonhuman primate species, showing changes in the microbiome (dysbiosis) that might be associated with pathogenic conditions. The aim of the present study was to identify and compare enteric viromes of SIVgor-infected and uninfected gorillas using noninvasive sampling and ultradeep sequencing, and to assess the association of virome composition with potential SIVgor pathogenesis in their natural hosts. Results: We analyzed both RNA and DNA virus libraries of 23 fecal samples from 11 SIVgor-infected (two samples from one animal) and 11 uninfected western lowland gorillas from Campo-Ma'an National Park (CP), in southwestern Cameroon. Three bacteriophage families (Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae) represented 67.5 and 68% of the total annotated reads in SIVgor-infected and uninfected individuals, respectively. Conversely, mammalian viral families, such as Herpesviridae and Reoviridae, previously associated with gut- and several mammalian diseases were significantly more abundant (p &lt; 0.003) in the SIVgor-infected group. In the present study, we analyzed, for the first time, the enteric virome of gorillas and their association with SIVgor status. This also provided the first evidence of association of specific mammalian viral families and SIVgor in a putative dysbiosis context. Conclusions: Our results suggested that viromes might be potentially used as markers of lentiviral disease progression in wild gorilla populations. The diverse mammalian viral families, herein described in SIVgor-infected gorillas, may play a pivotal role in a disease progression still unclear in these animals but already well characterized in pathogenic lentiviral infections in other organisms.

Non-redundant properties of IL-1α and IL-1β during acute colon inflammation in mice,"Bersudsky M, Luski L, Fishman D, White RM, Ziv-Sokolovskaya N, Dotan S, Rider P, Kaplanov I, Aychek T, Dinarello CA, Apte RN, Voronov E",2014,Article,10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303329,"Objective: The differential role of the IL-1 agonists, IL-1α, which is mainly cell-associated versus IL-1β, which is mostly secreted, was studied in colon inflammation. Design: Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis was induced in mice globally deficient in either IL-1α or IL-1β, and in wild-type mice, or in mice with conditional deletion of IL-1α in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Bone marrow transplantation experiments were performed to assess the role of IL-1α or IL-1β of myeloid versus colon non-hematopoietic cells in inflammation and repair in acute colitis. Results: IL-1α released from damaged IECs acts as an alarmin by initiating and propagating colon inflammation, as IL-1α deficient mice exhibited mild disease symptoms with improved recovery. IL-1β is involved in repair of IECs and reconstitution of the epithelial barrier during the resolution of colitis; its deficiency correlates with disease exacerbation. Neutralisation of IL-1α in control mice during acute colitis led to alleviation of clinical and histological manifestations, whereas treatment with rIL-1Ra or anti-IL-1β antibodies was not effective. Repair after colitis correlated with accumulation of CD8 and regulatory T cells in damaged crypts. Conclusions: The role of IL-1α and IL-1β differs in DSS-induced colitis in that IL-1α, mainly of colon epithelial cells is inflammatory, whereas IL-1β, mainly of myeloid cell origin, promotes healing and repair. Given the dissimilar functions of each IL-1 agonistic molecule, an IL-1 receptor blockade would not be as therapeutically effective as specific neutralising of IL-1α, which leaves IL-1β function intact.","; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta antibody; recombinant interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bone marrow cell; bone marrow transplantation; cd8+ t lymphocyte; colon injury; controlled study; cytokine release; dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis; disease exacerbation; disease severity; gene deletion; healing; intestine crypt; intestine epithelium cell; lymphocytic infiltration; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory t lymphocyte; tissue repair; wild type; experimental colitis; gut inflammation; interleukins; intestinal epithelium; mucosal immunity; animals; colitis; colon; dextran sulfate; disease models, animal; interleukin-1; interleukin-1alpha; interleukin-1beta; intestinal mucosa; leukemic infiltration; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; t-lymphocytes",No
Identification and characterization of wild lactobacilli and pediococci from spontaneously fermented Mountain Cheese,"Carafa I, Nardin T, Larcher R, Viola R, Tuohy K, Franciosi E",2015,Article,10.1016/j.fm.2014.12.003,"The Traditional Mountain Malga (TMM) cheese is made from raw cow's milk by spontaneously fermentation in small farms called ""Malga"" located in Trentino region. This study was designed to characterize the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) growing on MRS medium, of TMM-cheese at the end of the ripening. Ninety-five LAB were isolated and genotypically characterized by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) with two primers, species-specific PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. The 95 LAB clustered in 70 biotypes. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus paracasei were the dominant species. Isolates were tested for their growth properties, carbohydrate metabolism, acidifying ability, proteolytic and lipolytic activities, acetoin production, amino-peptidase (AP) activity, biogenic amines production, bile salts hydrolysis, conjugated linoleic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid production. Lb. paracasei isolates resulted to be well adapted to Malga environment and to show the best AP activity and acetoin production. TMM-cheese related LAB showed also interesting health promoting properties and produced bioactive substances. In particular, one Lb. brevis biotype produced a GABA mean value of 129mg/L that is considered a high concentration.

Diverse laboratory colonies of Aedes aegypti harbor the same adult midgut bacterial microbiome,"Dickson LB, Ghozlane A, Volant S, Bouchier C, Ma L, Vega-Rúa A, Dusfour I, Jiolle D, Paupy C, Mayanja MN, Kohl A, Lutwama JJ, Duong V, Lambrechts L",2018,Article,10.1186/s13071-018-2780-1,"Background: Host-associated microbes, collectively known as the microbiota, play an important role in the biology of multicellular organisms. In mosquito vectors of human pathogens, the gut bacterial microbiota influences vectorial capacity and has become the subject of intense study. In laboratory studies of vector biology, genetic effects are often inferred from differences between geographically and genetically diverse colonies of mosquitoes that are reared in the same insectary. It is unclear, however, to what extent genetic effects can be confounded by uncontrolled differences in the microbiota composition among mosquito colonies. To address this question, we used 16S metagenomics to compare the midgut bacterial microbiome of six laboratory colonies of Aedes aegypti recently derived from wild populations representing the geographical range and genetic diversity of the species. Results: We found that the diversity, abundance, and community structure of the midgut bacterial microbiome was remarkably similar among the six different colonies of Ae. aegypti, regardless of their geographical origin. We also confirmed the relatively low complexity of bacterial communities inhabiting the mosquito midgut. Conclusions: Our finding that geographically diverse colonies of Ae. aegypti reared in the same insectary harbor a similar gut bacterial microbiome supports the conclusion that the gut microbiota of adult mosquitoes is environmentally determined regardless of the host genotype. Thus, uncontrolled differences in microbiota composition are unlikely to represent a significant confounding factor in genetic studies of vector biology. © 2018 The Author(s).","metagenomics; microbiota; mosquito; vectorial capacity; adult; aedes aegypti; article; bacterial microbiome; community structure; genetic variability; human; intestine flora; metagenomics; microbial community; midgut; nonhuman; aedes; animal; bacterium; chemistry; classification; cluster analysis; dna sequence; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; metagenomics; microbiology; phylogeny; ribosome dna; rna 16s; aedes; animals; bacteria; cluster analysis; dna, ribosomal; gastrointestinal microbiome; gastrointestinal tract; metagenomics; phylogeny; rna, ribosomal, 16s; sequence analysis, dna",No
An escherichia coli nissle 1917 missense mutant colonizes the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine better than the wild type but is not a better probiotic,"Adediran J, Leatham-Jensen MP, Mokszycki ME, Frimodt-Møller J, Krogfelt KA, Kazmierczak K, Kenney LJ, Conway T, Cohena PS",2014,Article,10.1128/IAI.01149-13,"Previously we reported that the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine selected for two different Escherichia coli MG1655 mutants with improved colonizing ability: nonmotile E. coli MG1655 flhDC deletion mutants that grew 15% faster in vitro in mouse cecal mucus and motile E. coli MG1655 envZ missense mutants that grew slower in vitro in mouse cecal mucus yet were able to cocolonize with the faster-growing flhDC mutants.

Intestinal steroid profiles and microbiota composition in colitic mice,"Wohlgemuth S, Keller S, Kertscher R, Stadion M, Haller D, Kisling S, Jahreis G, Blaut M, Loh G",2011,Article,10.4161/gmic.2.3.16104,"Reduced gut microbiota diversity in conjunction with a bloom of a few bacterial species is a common feature in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, the environmental changes caused by inflammation and their possible impact on the microbiota are largely unknown. Since IBD is associated with an impaired intestinal steroid metabolism, we hypothesized that changes in intestinal steroid and particularly bile acid (BA) concentrations affect microbial communities. We used Interleukin-10 deficient (IL-10 -/-) mice as a model for chronic gut inflammation. Healthy wild-type mice served as controls. In these animals, intestinal steroid concentrations and gut microbial diversity were analyzed at 24 weeks of age. The IL-10 -/- mice developed moderate inflammation in cecum and colon and colorectal tumor formation was observed in 55% of the animals. Compared to the healthy conditions, gut inflammation was associated with higher intestinal cholesterol and cholic acid concentrations and a reduced microbial diversity. The latter was accompanied by a proliferation of Robinsoniella peoriensis, Clostridium innocuum, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus gallinarum. All these species proved to be highly bile acid resistant. We concluded that chronic colitis in IL-10 -/- mice is associated with changes in intestinal steroid profiles. These changes may be due to alterations in gut microbiota composition or vice versa.

Sustained Inhibition of NF-κB Activity Mitigates Retinal Vasculopathy in Diabetes,"Homme RP, Sandhu HS, George AK, Tyagi SC, Singh M",2021,Article,10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.01.016,"This study investigated the effects of long-term NF-κB inhibition in mitigating retinal vasculopathy in a type 1 diabetic mouse model (Akita, Ins2Akita). Akita and wild-type (C57BL/6J) male mice, 24 to 26 weeks old, were treated with or without a selective inhibitor of NF-κB, 4-methyl-N1-(3-phenyl-propyl) benzene-1,2-diamine (JSH-23), for 4 weeks. Treatment was given when the mice were at least 24 weeks old. Metabolic parameters, key inflammatory mediators, blood-retinal barrier junction molecules, retinal structure, and function were measured. JSH-23 significantly lowered basal glucose levels and intraocular pressure in Akita. It also mitigated vascular remodeling and microaneurysms significantly. Optical coherence tomography of untreated Akita showed thinning of retinal layers; however, treatment with JSH-23 could prevent it. Electroretinogram demonstrated that A- and B-waves in Akita were significantly smaller than in wild type mice, indicating that JSH-23 intervention prevented loss of retinal function. Protein levels and gene expression of key inflammatory mediators, such as NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2, were decreased after JSH-23 treatment. At the same time, connexin-43 and occludin were maintained. Vision-guided behavior also improved significantly. The results show that reducing inflammation could protect the diabetic retina and its vasculature.

Fecal glucocorticoids and gastrointestinal parasite infections in wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) involved in ecotourism,"Shutt-Phillips K, Pafčo B, Heistermann M, Kasim A, Petrželková KJ, Profousová-Pšenková I, Modrý D, Todd A, Fuh T, Dicky J-F, Bopalanzognako J-B, Setchell JM",2021,Article,10.1016/j.ygcen.2021.113859,"Wildlife ecotourism can offer a source of revenue which benefits local development and conservation simultaneously. However, habituation of wildlife for ecotourism can cause long-term elevation of glucocorticoid hormones, which may suppress immune function and increase an animal's vulnerability to disease. We have previously shown that western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) undergoing habituation in Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, have higher fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGCM) levels than both habituated and unhabituated gorillas. Here, we tested the relationship between FGCM levels and strongylid infections in the same gorillas. If high FGCM levels suppress the immune system, we predicted that FGCM levels will be positively associated with strongylid egg counts and that gorillas undergoing habituation will have the highest strongylid egg counts, relative to both habituated and unhabituated gorillas. We collected fecal samples over 12 months in two habituated gorilla groups, one group undergoing habituation and completely unhabituated gorillas. We established FGCM levels and fecal egg counts of Necator/Oesophagostomum spp. and Mammomonogamus sp. Controlling for seasonal variation and age-sex category in strongylid infections we found no significant relationship between FGCMs and Nectator/Oesophagostomum spp. or Mammomonogamus sp. egg counts in a within group comparison in either a habituated group or a group undergoing habituation. However, across groups, egg counts of Nectator/Oesophagostomum spp. were lowest in unhabituated animals and highest in the group undergoing habituation, matching the differences in FGCM levels among these gorilla groups. Our findings partially support the hypothesis that elevated glucocorticoids reduce a host's ability to control the extent of parasitic infections, and show the importance of non-invasive monitoring of endocrine function and parasite infection in individuals exposed to human pressure including habituation process and ecotourism. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",conservation; endocrine; immunity; parasites; primate; ,No
"Comparison of Artemia-bacteria associations in brines, laboratory cultures and the gut environment: a study based on Chilean hypersaline environments","Quiroz M, Triado-Margarit X, Casamayor EO, Gajardo G",2015,Article,10.1007/s00792-014-0694-1,"The brine shrimp Artemia (Crustacea) and a diversity of halophilic microorganisms coexist in natural brines, salterns and laboratory cultures; part of such environmental microbial diversity is represented in the gut of Artemia individuals. Bacterial diversity in these environments was assessed by 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting. Eight natural locations in Chile, where A. franciscana or A. persimilis occur, were sampled for analysis of free-living and gut-associated bacteria in water from nature and laboratory cultures. The highest ecological diversity (Shannon's index, H') was found in brines, it decreased in the gut of wild and laboratory animals, and in laboratory water. Significant differences in H' existed between brines and laboratory water, and between brines and gut of wild animals. The greatest similarity of bacterial community composition was between brines and the gut of field animals, suggesting a transient state of the gut microbiota. Sequences retrieved from DGGE patterns (n = 83) exhibited an average of 97.8 % identity with 41 bacterial genera from the phyla Proteobacteria (55.4 % of sequences match), Bacteroidetes (22.9 %), Actinobacteria (16.9 %) and Firmicutes (4.8 %). Environment-exclusive genera distribution was seen in Sphingomonas and Paenibacillus (gut of field animals), Amaricoccus and Ornithinimicrobium (gut of laboratory animals), and Hydrogenophaga (water of laboratory cultures).

MAP3K2 augments Th1 cell differentiation via IL-18 to promote T cell-mediated colitis,"Wu N, Chen D, Sun H, Tan J, Zhang Y, Zhang T, Han Y, Liu H, Ouyang X, Yang X-D, Niu X, Zhong J, Wang Z, Su B",2021,Article,10.1007/s11427-020-1720-9,"T cell-mediated immunity in the intestine is stringently controlled to ensure proper immunity against pathogenic microbes and to prevent autoimmunity, a known cause of inflammatory bowel disease. However, precisely how T cells regulate intestine immunity remains to be fully understood. In this study, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2) is required for the CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammation in the intestine. Using a T cell transfer colitis model, we found that MAP3K2-deficient naïve CD4 T cells had a dramatically reduced ability to induce colitis compared to wild type T cells. In addition, significantly fewer IFN-γ- but more IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells in the intestines of mice receiving MAP3K2-deficient T cells than in those from mice receiving wild type T cells was observed. Interestingly, under well-defined in vitro differentiation conditions, MAP3K2-deficient naïve T cells were not impaired in their ability to differentiate into Th1, Th17 and Treg. Furthermore, the MAP3K2-regulated colitis severity was mediated by Th1 but not Th17 cells in the intestine. At the molecular level, we showed that MAP3K2-mediated Th1 cell differentiation in the intestine was regulated by IL-18 and required specific JNK activation. Together, our study reveals a novel regulatory role of MAP3K2 in intestinal T cell immunity via the IL-18-MAP3K2-JNK axis and may provide a novel target for intervention in T cell-mediated colitis. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",colitis; il-18; map3k2; t cell immunity; th1; ,No
TLR2 controls intestinal carcinogen detoxication by CYP1A1,"Do KN, Fink LN, Jensen TE, Gautier L, Parlesak A",2012,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0032309,"Intestinal cytochrome P450 subclass 1A1 (CYP1A1) contributes to a metabolic ""shield"" protecting the host from ingested carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The expression of CYP1 (including CYP1A2 and CYP1B1) is considered to depend solely on a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). So far, no interference has been noted between the regulation of CYP1 and the activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which modulates the inflammatory response to bacterial cell wall components in immune cells and enterocytes. Here we report that intestinal CYP1A1 is silenced in TLR2-deficient mice, even when under exposure to the carcinogenic PAH benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). In contrast, hepatic CYP1A1 was moderately induced in TLR2-deficient mice without restoring their ability to clear BaP from systemic circulation, as present in wild-type animals. After feeding of BaP for 21 days, only TLR2 -/- mice, but not their wild type littermates developed polyps in the colon. Gene expressions and protein concentrations of AHR and ARNT in the intestine did not differ between the genotypes. In conclusion, the presence of ligands for TLR2 of bacterial origin seems to be crucial for detoxication of luminal carcinogens by CYP1A1 in the intestine. This unprecedented finding indicates a complex interplay between the immune system of the host and intestinal bacteria with detoxication mechanisms.

Influence of TRAIL Deficiency on Th17 Cells and Colonic Microbiota in Experimental Colitis Mouse Model,"Lin D-P, Jin Y-L, Hu D-Y, Ying S-J, Jiang Y",2021,Article,10.1016/j.amjms.2021.04.011,"Background: The abnormalities of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are implicated in various autoimmune disorders and tumors. This study investigated the influence of TRAIL deficiency on Th17 cells and colonic microbiota in experimental colitis mouse model. Methods: Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: wild-type, TRAIL gene knock-out (TRAIL−/−), wild-type colitis and TRAIL−/− colitis groups. Colitis was induced by oral administration of 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 consecutive days. Mice were given scores for disease severity both clinically and histopathologically. Th17 cells in peripheral blood and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were assessed using flow cytometry. The expression levels of Th17 cell markers IL-17A and ROR-γt were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The colonic samples were also analyzed for microbiota profile by 16s-rDNA gene sequencing on variable V4 region. Results: Compared with wild-type counterparts, TRAIL−/− mice developed more severe colitis after DSS treatment. Colitis TRAIL−/− mice had increased proportion of Th17 cells and elevated mRNA expression levels of IL-17A and ROR-γt in peripheral blood and MLNs compared with colitis wild-type mice. In contrast to colitis wild-type mice, the composition of colonic microbiota was shifted in colitis TRAIL−/- mice, and was characterized by increased alpha diversity, increased TM7, deferribacteres and tenericutes, and decreased proteobacteria at the phylum level.

Microbiota-Inducible Innate Immune Siderophore Binding Protein Lipocalin 2 Is Critical for Intestinal Homeostasis,"Singh V, Yeoh BS, Chassaing B, Zhang B, Saha P, Xiao X, Awasthi D, Shashidharamurthy R, Dikshit M, Gewirtz A, Vijay-Kumar M",2016,Article,10.1016/j.jcmgh.2016.03.007,"Background & Aims: Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is a multifunctional innate immune protein whose expression closely correlates with the extent of intestinal inflammation. However, whether Lcn2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of gut inflammation is unknown. Herein, we investigated the extent to which Lcn2 regulates inflammation and gut bacterial dysbiosis in mouse models of IBD. Methods: Lcn2 expression was monitored in murine colitis models and upon microbiota ablation/restoration. Wild-type (WT) and Lcn2 knockout (Lcn2KO) mice were analyzed for gut bacterial load, composition by 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing, and their colitogenic potential by co-housing with interleukin (Il)10KO mice. Acute (dextran sodium sulfate) and chronic (IL10R neutralization and T-cell adoptive transfer) colitis were induced in WT and Lcn2KO mice with or without antibiotics. Results: Lcn2 expression was dramatically induced on inflammation and was dependent on the presence of a gut microbiota and MyD88 signaling. Use of bone marrow-chimeric mice showed that nonimmune cells are the major contributors of circulating Lcn2. Lcn2KO mice showed increased levels of entA-expressing gut bacteria burden, and, moreover, a broadly distinct bacterial community relative to WT littermates. Lcn2KO mice developed highly colitogenic T cells and showed exacerbated colitis on exposure to DSS or neutralization of IL10. Such exacerbated colitis could be prevented by antibiotic treatment. Moreover, exposure to the microbiota of Lcn2KO mice, via cohousing, resulted in severe colitis in Il10KO mice. Conclusions: Lcn2 is a bacterially induced, MyD88-dependent protein that plays an important role in gut homeostasis and a pivotal role on challenge. Hence, therapeutic manipulation of Lcn2 levels may provide a strategy to help manage diseases driven by alteration of the gut microbiota. © 2016 The Authors.",colitis; germ-free mice; gut microbiota; ibd; innate immunity; myd88; neutrophils; ngal; siderocalin; dextran sulfate; interleukin 10 receptor; myeloid differentiation factor 88; neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin; rna 16s; siderophore; adoptive transfer; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; bacterial load; controlled study; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; homeostasis; human; human cell; intestine flora; irritable colon; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; pyrosequencing; t lymphocyte,No
TLR2 plays a pivotal role in mediating mucosal serotonin production in the gut,"Wang H, Kwon YH, Dewan V, Vahedi F, Syed S, Fontes ME, Ashkar AA, Surette MG, Khan WI",2019,Article,10.4049/jimmunol.1801034,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) is a key enteric signaling molecule that mediates various physiological processes in the gut. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the mucosal layer of the gut are the main source of 5-HT in the body and are situated in close proximity to the gut microbiota. In this study, we identify a pivotal role of TLR2 in 5-HT production in the gut. Antibiotic treatment reduces EC cell numbers and 5-HT levels in naive C57BL/6 mice, which is associated with downregulation of TLR2 expression but not TLR1 or TLR4. TLR2-deficient (Tlr22/2) and Myd882/2 mice express lower EC cell numbers and 5-HT levels, whereas treatment with TLR2/1 agonist upregulates 5-HT production in irradiated C57BL/6 mice, which are reconstituted with Tlr22/2 bone marrow cells, and in germ-free mice. Human EC cell line (BON-1 cells) release higher 5-HT upon TLR2/1 agonist via NF-kB pathway. Tlr22/2 mice and anti-TLR2 Ab–treated mice infected with enteric parasite, Trichuris muris, exhibited attenuated 5-HT production, compared with infected wild-type mice. Moreover, excretory-secretory products from T. muris induce higher 5-HT production in BON-1 cells via TLR2 in a dose-dependent manner, whereby the effect of excretory-secretory products is abrogated by TLR2 antagonist. These findings not only suggest an important role of TLR2 in mucosal 5-HT production in the gut by resident microbiota as well as by a nematode parasite but also provide, to our knowledge, novel information on the potential benefits of targeting TLR2 in various gut disorders that exhibit aberrant 5-HT signaling.

Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa aggravates inflammatory responses in murine chronic colitis,"Von Klitzing E, Ekmekciu I, Kühl AA, Bereswill S, Heimesaat MM",2018,Article,10.1038/s41598-018-25034-2,"The World Health Organization has rated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Psae) as serious threat to human health. We here addressed whether chronic murine gut inflammation facilitates intestinal MDR Psae colonization and whether bacterial infection subsequently worsens colonic immunopathology. Converse to wildtype counterparts, Psae colonized the intestines of IL-10-/- mice with chronic colitis following peroral challenge, but did not lead to changes in intestinal microbiota composition. Psae infection accelerated both macroscopic (i.e. clinical) and microscopic disease (i.e. colonic epithelial apoptosis), that were accompanied by increased intestinal pro-inflammatory immune responses as indicated by elevated colonic numbers of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets and enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IFN-γ in mesenteric lymph nodes of Psae-infected as compared to unchallenged IL-10-/- mice. Remarkably, Psae-induced pro-inflammatory immune responses were not restricted to the gut, but could also be observed systemically as indicated by increased TNF and IFN-γ concentrations in sera upon Psae-infection. Furthermore, viable commensals originating from the intestinal microbiota translocated to extra-intestinal compartments such as liver, kidney and spleen of Psae-infected IL-10-/- mice with chronic colitis only. Hence, peroral MDR Psae-infection results in exacerbated colonic as well as systemic pro-inflammatory immune responses during chronic murine colitis. © 2018 The Author(s).","; cytokine; il10 protein, mouse; interleukin 10; adaptive immunity; animal; bacterial translocation; chronic disease; colitis; complication; disease model; drug effect; inflammation; innate immunity; isolation and purification; knockout mouse; lymph node; microbiology; mouse; multidrug resistance; pathology; pseudomonas aeruginosa; pseudomonas infection; adaptive immunity; animals; bacterial translocation; chronic disease; colitis; cytokines; disease models, animal; drug resistance, multiple, bacterial; immunity, innate; inflammation; interleukin-10; lymph nodes; mice; mice, knockout; pseudomonas aeruginosa; pseudomonas infections",No
Mice with dysfunctional TGF-β signaling develop altered intestinal microbiome and colorectal cancer resistant to 5FU,"Wang Z, Hopson LM, Singleton SS, Yang X, Jogunoori W, Mazumder R, Obias V, Lin P, Nguyen B-N, Yao M, Miller L, White J, Rao S, Mishra L",2021,Article,10.1016/j.bbadis.2021.166179,"Emerging data show a rise in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in young men and women that is often chemoresistant. One potential risk factor is an alteration in the microbiome. Here, we investigated the role of TGF-β signaling on the intestinal microbiome and the efficacy of chemotherapy for CRC induced by azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate in mice. We used two genotypes of TGF-β-signaling-deficient mice (Smad4+/− and Smad4+/−Sptbn1+/−), which developed CRC with similar phenotypes and had similar alterations in the intestinal microbiome. Using these mice, we evaluated the intestinal microbiome and determined the effect of dysfunctional TGF-β signaling on the response to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-Fluoro-uracil (5FU) after induction of CRC. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we determined gut microbiota composition in mice with CRC and found reduced amounts of beneficial species of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides in the mutants compared to the wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, the mutant mice with CRC were resistant to 5FU. Whereas the abundances of E. boltae, B.dorei, Lachnoclostridium sp., and Mordavella sp. were significantly reduced in mice with CRC, these species only recovered to basal amounts after 5FU treatment in WT mice, suggesting that the alterations in the intestinal microbiome resulting from compromised TGF-β signaling impaired the response to 5FU. These findings could have implications for inhibiting the TGF-β pathway in the treatment of CRC or other cancers. © 2021",5fu; bacteroides; chemoresistance; colorectal cancer; microbiome; tgf-β signaling; azoxymethane; dextran sulfate; fluorouracil; transforming growth factor beta; alistipes finefoldii; alistipes shahii; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; article; bacteroides; bacteroides caccae; bacteroides dorei; bacteroides fragilis; bacteroides ovatus; bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; bacteroides vulgatus; cancer chemotherapy; cancer incidence; cancer resistance; colitis-associated cancer; colon adenocarcinoma; colorectal cancer; controlled study; enterocloster boltae; feces analysis; female; fusobacterium nucleatum; genotype; halomonas; immunohistochemistry; intestine flora; lachnoclostridium; male; metagenomics; mordavella; mouse; nonhuman; parabacteroides; phenotype; shotgun sequencing; tgf beta signaling; transgenic mouse; tumor growth; tumor number; tumor volume,No
Human encroachment into wildlife gut microbiomes,"Fackelmann G, Gillingham MAF, Schmid J, Heni AC, Wilhelm K, Schwensow N, Sommer S",2021,Article,10.1038/s42003-021-02315-7,"In the Anthropocene, humans, domesticated animals, wildlife, and their environments are interconnected, especially as humans advance further into wildlife habitats. Wildlife gut microbiomes play a vital role in host health. Changes to wildlife gut microbiomes due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation, can disrupt natural gut microbiota homeostasis and make animals vulnerable to infections that may become zoonotic. However, it remains unclear whether the disruption to wildlife gut microbiomes is caused by habitat fragmentation per se or the combination of habitat fragmentation with additional anthropogenic disturbances, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and their pathogens. Here, we show that habitat fragmentation per se does not impact the gut microbiome of a generalist rodent species native to Central America, Tome's spiny rat Proechimys semispinosus, but additional anthropogenic disturbances do. Indeed, compared to protected continuous and fragmented forest landscapes that are largely untouched by other human activities, the gut microbiomes of spiny rats inhabiting human-disturbed fragmented landscapes revealed a reduced alpha diversity and a shifted and more dispersed beta diversity. Their microbiomes contained more taxa associated with domesticated animals and their potential pathogens, suggesting a shift in potential metagenome functions. On the one hand, the compositional shift could indicate a degree of gut microbial adaption known as metagenomic plasticity. On the other hand, the greater variation in community structure and reduced alpha diversity may signal a decline in beneficial microbial functions and illustrate that gut adaption may not catch up with anthropogenic disturbances, even in a generalist species with large phenotypic plasticity, with potentially harmful consequences to both wildlife and human health.","; adaptation; animal; ecosystem; human; intestine flora; metagenome; microbiology; microflora; physiology; wild animal; adaptation, physiological; animals; animals, wild; ecosystem; gastrointestinal microbiome; humans; metagenome; microbiota",No
"Manipulation of microbiota reveals altered callosal myelination and white matter plasticity in a model of Huntington disease (Reprinted from Neurobiology of Disease, vol 127, pg 65-75, 2019)","Radulescu CI, Garcia-Miralles M, Sidik H, Bardile CF, Yusof NABM, Lee HU, Ho EXP, Chu CW, Layton E, Low D, De Sessions PF, Pettersson S, Ginhoux F, Pouladi MA",2020,Reprint,10.1016/j.nbd.2020.104744,"Structural and molecular myelination deficits represent early pathological features of Huntington disease (HD). Recent evidence from germ-free (GF) animals suggests a role for microbiota-gut-brain bidirectional communication in the regulation of myelination. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of microbiota on myelin plasticity and oligodendroglial population dynamics in the mixed-sex BACHD mouse model of HD. Ultrastructural analysis of myelin in the corpus callosum revealed alterations of myelin thickness in BACHD GF compared to specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice, whereas no differences were observed between wild-type (WT) groups. In contrast, myelin compaction was altered in all groups when compared to WT SPF animals. Levels of myelin-related proteins were generally reduced, and the number of mature oligodendrocytes was decreased in the prefrontal cortex under GF compared to SPF conditions, regardless of genotype. Minor differences in commensal bacteria at the family and genera levels were found in the gut microbiota of BACHD and WT animals housed in standard living conditions. Our findings indicate complex effects of a germ-free status on myelin-related characteristics, and highlight the adaptive properties of myelination as a result of environmental manipulation.",huntington disease; bachd; white matter; myelination; oligodendrocytes; germ-free; microbiota; microbiome; age-of-onset; gut microbiome; trinucleotide repeat; mouse model; mice; gene; cns; bacteria; cells; pathogenesis,No
